        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: market sizing; estimate or guesstimate.\nConsulting Firm: AlixPartners first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: oil, gas, petroleum industry.\nCase Interview Question #01069: Exxon is a chain of gas stations owned by multinational oil and gas corporation Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM). Exxon is Exxon Mobil’s primary retail gasoline brand in most of the United States, with the highest concentration of retail outlets located in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas and in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern states.\nSuppose you are flying on a plane with the CEO from Exxon and you want to sell a consulting engagement to him. He has just left to use the lavatory and you have about five minutes to estimate Exxon’s yearly revenues from personal automobile gasoline sales in the United States (excluding commercial trucks, corporate fleets, rental cars, motorcycles, boats, etc.). How would you go about coming up with this estimate?\nPossible Answer:\nAssume the population of the U.S. is 300 million.\nEstimated the average number of people per household is 3, making 100 million households in the U.S.\nEstimated the average number of cars per household is 1.5, which gives 150 million personal cars in the U.S.\nAssume each car gets filled up once per week, or 50 times per year to use simple numbers.\nAssume the average fill-up is 10 gallons, 50 * 10 = 500 gallons per car per year.\nTotal gallons of gas sold in a year is 500 * 150 million = 75 billion.\nIf average gasoline price is $2 per gallon, total revenue from U.S. automobiles is 75B * $2 = $150 billion.\nEstimated market share of Exxon is 20%. The interviewer asked me why, and I explained that I believed the market was basically an oligopoly with a few big players dominating the market (Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Chevron, Conoco Phillips). This type of market typically has market share of the dominating competitors of around 20%.\nCalculated total revenues for Exxon from the U.S. household automobile market, therefore, is $150B * 20% = $30 billion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: pricing & valuation.\nConsulting Firm: Cornerstone Research first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: retail; healthcare: hospital & medical.\nCase Interview Question #01073: Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) is the second-largest discount retailer in the United States, behind Walmart. Headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Target operates more than 1,700 locations throughout the United States as of 2015. Their retail formats include the discount store Target, the hypermarket SuperTarget, and “flexible format” stores previously named CityTarget and TargetExpress before being consolidated under the Target branding.\nTarget operates over 1,300 pharmacies in their retail stores. Their pharmacy operations have flat sales while the overall retail pharmacy industry is growing. Target pharmacy’s profitability is very poor relative to industry. The Target pharmacy chain has a history of decentralized pricing and promotion for pharmaceuticals, leading to strong autonomy in field operations, as well as wildly inconsistent pricing. Customer pricing complaints and customer attrition is chronic. Target’s new head of pharmacy operations has engaged our consulting firm to solve the pricing issue. How should we proceed?\nPossible Answers:\n1. Utilization of 3C’s framework \na. Customers\n• Who are the customers?\n• How do they select a pharmacy?\n• How important is price? \nCustomers are generally older, repeat, discount-sensitive shoppers (as opposed to convenience oriented shoppers). Customers may initially select a pharmacy on referral, location, or price and tend to build strong loyalty to pharmacy sue to personal relation with pharmacist and high switching costs (transfer of records, etc.…). Price tends to be a major factor. Particularly given nature of customer (usually pay in cash from fixed income) and trust relationship (Price fluctuations tend to be very bad). Inconsistent pricing on a give item may lead to price shipping, exposing all purchases to scrutiny and losing a customer.\nb. Company\n• How do we price?\nWe generally recommend a standard mark-up from cost, with price matching to be determined by the pharmacist at the store. As mentioned before, this leads to wildly different pricing from store to store, as different pharmacists are vigilant to different degrees regarding optimal pricing strategies.\nc. Competition\n• Who are competitors?\n• How do competitors price?\nCompetitors come in three distinct groups: (1) chain drug stores (Walgreen’s, CVS, etc.), (2) independent pharmacies, and (3) other discount retailer chains with pharmacy operations (Wal-Mart, Kmart, Costco). Our client Target is in the “discount” group, but competition is fierce between groups.\n2. Next step: Pricing study\nSelect a market basket of items in commonly dispensed quantities and call for prices from a selection of competitors’ and our stores across the country.\nStudy finds that prices on high volume items are very erratic, from our prices at the higher end to well below cost at some discounters. Less common items display more consistent pricing across chains, with our prices more or less in line. The items with the most aggressive pricing are maintenance items that are taken for the rest of a patient’s life like heart, diabetes, and cholesterol. They represent an unavoidable expense and customers are very sensitive to pricing on these items.\n3. Solution\nTest a pricing program where prices are set centrally for a number of stores in different markets. In this test, set prices very aggressively for items identified as key items, and try to make up margins on non-key items. Monitor results, adapt and roll out if volume and profits warrant.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: private equity & investment.\nConsulting Firm: ZS Associates 2nd round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: electronics, semiconductors; information technology (IT).\nCase Interview Question #01090: Our client Silver Lake Partners is an American private equity firm focused on leveraged buyout and growth capital investments in technology, technology-enabled and related industries. Notable technology companies among its investment holdings are Dell, Alibaba, Go Daddy, Skype, Symantec, Seagate Technology and NASDAQ. Silver Lake Partners is headquartered in Menlo Park with additional offices in San Mateo, Cupertino, New York, London, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Tokyo.\nIt’s late 2006. Our client Silver Lake Partners is looking to acquire a company in the emerging smartphone industry. There are currently only two firms in the market: SmartCo and PhoneCo. Our client Silver Lake has decided to definitely purchase one of the two firms, but they’ve hired us to help them figure out which one. How would you approach this problem? Which one would you recommend the client to purchase?\nAdditional Information: (to be provided upon request)\n• This case is set in late 2006. The iPhone was announced in January 2007 and launched in June 2007, so it shouldn’t be a factor in the initial decision.\n• In the real world, there were more than two smartphone firms in the market. This is a simplified case, so what you know about Research In Motion/RIM, BlackBerry, Motorola, Nokia, etc. doesn’t necessarily apply here.\n• Our client cares about the value of the firm at an exit in 5 years, so a DCF (Discounted Cash Flows) won’t be necessary.\nPossible Answers:\n1. Case Overview\nThis is an exhibits-heavy private equity & investment case. After laying out the framework, guide the candidate to Question #1 (market size) immediately.\n2. Sample Framework\na. Valuation Economics\n• Revenues: Price and Quantity (Market Size and Share)\n• Costs: Fixed and Variable Costs)\n• Discount Rate\nb. Smartphone Companies\n• Products (SmartCo vs. PhoneCo)\n• Technology (patents or other technological advantage)\n• Barriers to Entry (how easy is each company to copy?)\nc. Smartphone Customers\n• Segmentation (behavioral? demographic? income-based?)\n• Needs by Segment (keyboard? security? fast connectivity? etc.)\nThe discount rate isn’t necessary here, but is a good thing to include in the framework. A great framework will address not only the economics of the deal (revenues and costs), but also discuss other reasons our client might want to purchase a particular company, including advantages with customer segments, technology and patents, capabilities (design, R&D, marketing), etc.\n3. Detailed Analysis\na. Revenues and Costs\nVariable costs are $150 per unit for SmartCo, $200 per unit for PhoneCo.\n• Price is $250 per unit for SmartCo, $300 per unit for PhoneCo.\n• Ignore fixed costs (but more sales mean fixed costs are less of an issue).\nb. Market Size\nHand the candidate Exhibit #1 (see below).\nc. Customers and Products\nHand the candidate Exhibit #2 (see below).\nQuestion #1: Hand candidate Exhibit #1. Our client expects the mobile phone market as a whole to grow 5% over the next 5 years.\nOur client also expects smartphones’ market share of the mobile market to grow 50% for businesses, 100% for prosumers, and 200% for consumers over the next 5 years. What will the smartphone market be in Year 5 for each segment? What does that mean for us?\nExhibit #1: Mobile Phone Market (2007 est.)\n\nPossible Solution:\nNote: Approximation is fine for this question. (In fact, getting the exact numbers would take too long.)\nCalculations\n\n\n\nSegment\nBusiness\nProsumer\nConsumer\n\n\nTotal Mobile Market (Year 1)\n$60b\n$80b\n$300b\n\n\nSmartphone Share of Mobile Market (Year 1)\n50%\n25%\n5%\n\n\nSmartphone Market (Year 1)\n$60b*50% = $30b\n$80b*25% = $20b\n$300b*5% = $15b\n\n\nTotal Mobile Market (Year 5)\n$60b*105% = $63b\n$80b*105% = $84b\n$300b*105% = $315b\n\n\nSmartphone Share of Mobile Market (Year 5)\n75%\n50%\n15%\n\n\nSmartphone Market (Year 5)\n$63b*75% = $47.25b\n$84b*50% = $42b\n$315b*15% = $47.25b\n\n\nSmartphone Growth\n$17.25b\n$22b\n$32.25b\n\n\n\nWhile all segments are approximately equal in Year 5, most businesses and half of prosumers are using smartphones. Meanwhile, only 15% of customers are using smartphones, which means the consumer market has much more room for growth. We should acquire the company that appeals to consumers.\nQuestion #2: Hand candidate Exhibit #2. Here’s some data from a survey of all smartphone customers. What does this mean for our client? Is there any other information you’d want to know?\nExhibit #2: Customer Survey (scale of 1 to 5)\nSurvey Question 1: How important are the following attributes in a smartphone?\nSurvey Question 2: How would you rate (SmartCo / PhoneCo)’s performance on each attribute?\n\n\n\nAttribute\nWeb\nStyle\nPrice\nScreen\nApps\nE-mail\n\n\nImportance\n4.7\n4.6\n4.2\n3.9\n3.7\n3.4\n\n\nSmartCo\n3.9\n4.7\n4.4\n3.6\n4.2\n3.4\n\n\nPhoneCo\n4.5\n4.2\n3.6\n3.7\n3.0\n4.4\n\n\n\nScale: 5 = highest, 1 = lowest\nSample: All customer segments\nPossible Solution:\nThis is a red herring; there isn’t much information here that is helpful to our client. A bad response tries to draw too much meaning from these numbers. A good response identifies that the phones are more or less equal to all customers. A great response identifies that this data might be different for each customer segment and asks whether there’s any additional information on how each segment sees the two products.\nQuestion #3: Hand candidate Exhibit #3. (Ideally, the candidate should ask for this data in the previous question.) Here’s that same survey broken out into two customer segments. What does this mean for our client?\nExhibit #3: Customer Survey by Segment (scale of 1 to 5)\nSurvey Question 1: How important are the following attributes in a smartphone?\nSurvey Question 2: How would you rate (SmartCo / PhoneCo)’s performance on each attribute?\nBusinesses\n\n\n\nAttribute\nE-mail\nWeb\nScreen\n\n\nImportance\n5.0\n4.8\n4.4\n\n\nSmartCo\n3.2\n3.7\n3.9\n\n\nPhoneCo\n4.7\n4.5\n4.0\n\n\n\nScale: 5 = highest, 1 = lowest\nSample: Business segment customers\nConsumers\n\n\n\nAttribute\nStyle\nPrice\nApps\n\n\nImportance\n4.7\n4.6\n4.2\n\n\nSmartCo\n4.9\n4.8\n4.4\n\n\nPhoneCo\n2.8\n3.2\n2.6\n\n\n\nScale: 5 = highest, 1 = lowest\nSample: Consumer segment customers\nPossible Solution:\nA good response identifies that SmartCo appeals to consumers and PhoneCo appeals to businesses. (If asked, prosumers are a mix, but lean slightly toward SmartCo.) A great response ties this information together with the market size for consumers from the previous question and recommends that our client purchase SmartCo unprompted.\n4. Conclusion\na. Sample Recommendation\nOur client should purchase SmartCo because they produce a phone that appeals to consumers. Consumers will be roughly a third of the market in five years, but since smartphones will only be 15% of the mobile phone market, the consumer segment will have enormous room for growth (whereas businesses and prosumers will not).\nb. Potential Risks\n• Competitive entry. What if another player enters the market and tries to go after consumers?\n• PhoneCo. What if PhoneCo sees the consumer growth numbers and comes after our market?\n• Customer preferences. What if consumers value different attributes as the market grows?\n5. Bonus Question\nNote: Give this bonus question if the candidate has extra time and has correctly identified SmartCo as the most attractive acquisition option.\nBonus Question: Based on your recommendation, our client has decided to purchase SmartCo. But before they sign the deal, Apple announces that they’re releasing the iPhone. Does your recommendation change?\nPossible Solution:\nThe candidate can answer this question in three ways.\n• SmartCo is still the best bet. Potential reasoning:\n- The consumer market is big enough for multiple players.\n- We’re a 4.7/5 on style and a 4.8/5 on price – can Apple really beat that?\n- The iPhone may be just as appealing to businesses and prosumers; PhoneCo won’t be safe.\n• PhoneCo is a better bet. Potential reasoning:\n- Why compete with Apple when we can have a niche to ourselves?\n- Customers rank SmartCo highly now, but that might change when the iPhone is released.\n• Our client shouldn’t acquire either player. Potential reasoning:\n- There’s too much uncertainty in the market.\n- This is a very new industry, and anything can change; we should wait a few years to get a better picture.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The interviewer complained that one Harvard Business School MBA student neglected this detail and came up with a ridiculous answer like 16,000 people)\nPossible Answer:\nBreak into manageable subcategories and estimate them separately.\n• Business school – almost 2,000 people including MBA students, faculty and administrative staff, assume that I interact with 25%, so say 500.\n• Social settings – Events occur once or twice per week, more around the holidays, so say 100 events per year. The average number of people is on the order of 20 per event.  Same people can show up at different events, assume that I see the average person 4 times: 100 events * 20 people / 4 times = 500 people. Maybe 100 of these people are also at my business school, so round down to 400 people.\n• Everyday activities – dry cleaner, supermarket, grocery shopping, car wash, favorite pizza place, post office, etc. I typically interact with a cashier and server, so assume 2 interactions per visit. Assume 3 errands or visits per day = 20 locations per week, average visit interval is once every two weeks, so there are 40 unique locations * 2 interactions = 80 people. Round up to 100 to account for my neighbors, doorman, my doctor, dentist, and other people I see over and over.\n• Random meetings – people who stop you to ask for directions, people you talk to on the subway and people who attempt to steal your laptop or wallet – assume 2 people per week or 100 per year.\n• Other meetings – people you meet on vacation, at sporting events, shows, etc. Assume 100 people.\nTotal number of people in a year = 500 + 400 + 100 + 100 + 100 = approximately 1,200. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The company was founded in 1906 as the “New Balance Arch Support Company” and currently is one of the world’s major sports footwear manufacturers.\nThe client New Balance runs a national chain of shopping mall-based retail stores that specialize in athletic shoes (sneakers, cleats, etc.) and also carries sporting apparel (hats, t-shirts, sweatshirts, pants, shorts, etc.). There are two other mall-based athletic shoe retailers who are very similar to your client in terms of size, product mix and strategy: Puma and Adidas. Your client New Balance informs you that their profits are declining and wants you to determine why and recommend a strategy to deal with it. What would you recommend?\nAdditional Information: (to be provided if interviewee asks probing questions)\n• Sales are down at all three shopping mall-based retailers, but sneaker industry sales are up overall.\n• Costs have increased, but all increases have been passed along to consumers to maintain margins.\n• Non-traditional competitors have emerged who offer lower prices but no service.\n• Customers fit into two segments: “users” and “fashionites.”\n• “Users” represent 40% of sales and seek out durable products and knowledgeable salespeople.\n• “Fashionites” comprise the remaining 60% of sales and want to look good in the hottest new sneakers, but are more price conscious than the “users”.\nPossible Answers:\nProfits have decreased, so we use the profitability equation, Profit = Revenue – Cost = (Price * Quantity) – (Fixed Cost + Variable Cost). A simple 3 C’s analysis will also help bring out the key issues:\n• Company: What are the client company’s core strengths?\n• Competition: Who is the real competition and what are they doing differently?\n• Customers: What customer segments do we compete for and what are their unique needs?\nCosts have gone up, but so has price, so margins are relatively unchanged. Profits have decreased, so quantity must have decreased also. Sneaker sales are up overall, but have decreased in the malls so the other distribution channels must be stealing share. The other distribution channels must be identified and analyzed in terms of their value propositions (price, selection and service).\nIt turns out that discount stores like Wal-Mart and Target offer lower prices, but little variety and no service. Shopping mall stores offer good service but charge higher prices to cover their higher costs. The “users” depend on variety and quality service and have remained loyal to the shopping mall-based stores. Discounters do stock the hottest shoes at lower prices, so they must be stealing market share among the more price conscious “fashionites” who don’t care about service.\nSince the shopping mall-based retailer depends on both segments to survive, it cannot cut back on service for the “users”. It can, however, manage its inventory more effectively to offer discounts on the fastest moving “hot” shoes. Since the “fashionites” are likely to be in the shopping malls for other needs, they should be able to draw “fashionites” back into the stores. Losses due to the discounts on these shoes can be offset by increased volume, rapid turnover and complementary sales on sporting apparel like t-shirts and accessories once these customers are in the store. The prices do not need to match the discounters since the shopping mall-based store benefits inherently from mall based traffic and can charge a slight premium for the convenience of location.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Conclusion\na. Sample Recommendation\n• The client’s costs are too high relative to its sales; the client must achieve greater synergies and should then pursue recycled products and expand its customer base in janitorial supplies.\nb. Potential Risks\n• Reaching smaller companies for janitorial supplies may be more costly and could drive up SG&A costs.\n• Entering recycle products business will mean competing with established players.\nc. Next Steps\n• Investigate costs associated with expanding janitorial supplies sales networks.\n• Seek financing to support simultaneous expansion in two markets.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: increase sales; growth.\nConsulting Firm:  IMS Health Consulting Group  first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: healthcare: pharmaceutical, biotech, life sciences.\nCase Interview Question #01089: Our client Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE: TMO) is an American biotechnology product development and life sciences supply company, created by the merger of Thermo Electron and Fisher Scientific. The company’s products are sold under the brand names of Thermo Scientific, Fisher  Scientific, and several other recognized brand names.\nThe client Thermo Fisher is a major supplier to manufacturers of biological drugs known as biologics. Biologics, also known as biopharmaceuticals or biologic(al) medical products, are any pharmaceutical drug product manufactured in, extracted from, or semisynthesized from biological sources. Different from totally synthesized pharmaceuticals, they include vaccines, blood, blood components, allergenics, somatic cells, gene therapies, tissues, recombinant therapeutic protein, and living cells used in cell therapy.\nBiologics are manufactured through a complex process, and our client Thermo Fisher provides reaction tanks, chemicals, steel pipes, and other inputs to that process. The biologics industry has been growing at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 14% per year, and our client once shared similar growth. In the last few years, however, our client’s revenue growth has fallen to a CAGR of 4% only. What could be causing the slowdown, and how can we fix it? \nAdditional Information: (to be provided to candidate upon request)\n• Our client Thermo Fisher’s primary objective is to increase revenues. We’re not focusing on profitability.\n• Other suppliers to the biologics industry have been experiencing a similar slowdown in sales growth.\n• This is a new industry; our client is only about a decade old, and our client’s customers (pharmaceutical companies) have been manufacturing biologics for a relatively short period of time.\nPossible Answers:\n1. Case Overview\nThis is a case about a complex industry that tests a candidate’s ability to focus on the key drivers of revenue growth without any industry-specific knowledge.\n2. Suggested Framework\n3C’s framework: Company, Competitors, Customers\n• Company/Revenue Economics\n– Revenue = Price * Quantity\n– Price (have we decreased prices?)\n– Quantity (is our volume growth stagnating?)\n– Product Mix (are we selling cheaper supplies?)\n• Competitors\n– Current Competitors (are they scaling up?)\n– New Entrants (is the market getting crowded?)\n– Substitutes (are our products replaceable?)\n• Customers\n– Customer Segments (large, small, specialty, etc.)\n– Customer Mix\n– Customer Needs\n“Market” would be another fair area for analysis. However, the candidate should know from the initial information that the market is growing at a 14% CAGR.\n3. Qualitative Analysis\n• Company/Revenue Economics\n– Price: There’s been no change in our prices over the past few years.\n– Quantity: Quantities have grown at a CAGR of 4% a year. (Takeaway: Problem is on the Q side.)\n– Product Mix: Our product mix has remained relatively stagnant.\n• Competitors\n– Other suppliers to the biologics industry have been experiencing a similar slowdown in sales growth.\n– There have been no notable new entrants to the market.\n– No substitutes have developed for our products.\n• Customers (key area in this case!)\n– Our client Thermo Fisher’s customers are pharmaceutical companies (both major and minor) who produce biologics.\n– What could be causing customers to purchase fewer supplies? (have candidate brainstorm)\nKey points in this case:\n- Reaction tanks and steel pipes are long-lived assets; after an initial ramp up in capacity, they don’t need to be replaced for many years.\n- Learning effects/experience curves allow our customers to manufacture biologics drugs more efficiently with less equipment.\n- Technological innovations have made our products last longer. A certain reaction tank used to last 2 weeks before replacement, but now lasts 2 months.\n- Biologics manufacturers haven’t been investing in enough capacity to match expected demand (key point for the next part of case).\n4. Quantitative Analysis\nQuestion #1: Hand the candidate Exhibit #1. The year is 2011. Our team has put together some historical data and projections on demand and manufacturing capacity for biologics. What do you think?\nExhibit #1: Biologics Demand and Capacity (millions of units)\n\nPossible Solution:\nA good response identifies that after a brief period of overcapacity, demand is skyrocketing and leaving capacity in the dust.\nQuestion #2: (Candidate should get here on his or her own, but prompt if necessary.) Why do you think demand is outstripping capacity?\nPossible Solution:\nA great response tries to quantify the shortage and lays out one or more hypotheses for why it might be. For example:\n(1) Does it take a long time to add capacity in this business? (Yes.)\n(2) Are manufacturers colluding to try and keep prices high? (No.)\n(3) Are there regulatory hurdles preventing additional plants from being constructed? (No.)\nQuestion #3: What’s the CAGR for the shortage between now (2011) and 2014?\nPossible Solution:\nApproximations are fine here. This is a question designed to panic the candidate and test their comfort with numbers – they shouldn’t fall for it! Using the CAGR formula would take several minutes; it’s much better to approximate. Shortage in 2011 is ~20 and grows to ~60 by 2014. Approximating, we know a 50% CAGR would be (20 –> 30 –> 45 –> 67.5) so that’s too high. A 40% CAGR is a bit too low (20 –> 28 –> ~40 –> ~56 ). 45% fits much better (20 –> 29 –> ~42 –> ~60).\nAlternate method: 20 * (1 + x)^3 = 60, so (1 + x)^3 = 3. We can calculate 1.5^3 = 3.375, and 1.4^3 = 2.744. Approximating the cube root of 3, it’s 1.4, so 0.5 > x > 0.4\nKey Implication: The shortage is growing at an astounding rate – 45% compared to demand growth of 14%. Gravity has to take hold at some point – will there be a massive upswing in capacity in 2015/2016?\nQuestion #4: Assume that we’re pretty confident the numbers in Exhibit #1 are true and demand won’t pick up through 2014. What are some other ways our client Thermo Fisher could increase revenues?\nPossible Solution:\nCandidate should brainstorm as many (and as creative) options as possible. Two important areas:\n• Gain share:\n– Cut prices or increase marketing and direct sales\n– Innovate with better-quality product\n– Change product mix toward items that need to be replaced more often\n– Acquire a competitor and try to gain supplier power to increase prices.\n• Create new revenue streams:\n– Get into services to help customers meet the upcoming capacity shortage\n– Begin selling additional inputs into the biologics manufacturing process\n– Get into the biologics industry ourselves! (Massive growth + capacity shortage.)\n5. Conclusion\na. Sample Recommendation\n• Our client Thermo Fisher should take advantage of the upcoming capacity shortage by getting into services to help our customers (the biologics manufacturers) ramp up capacity.\nNote: Any recommendation is appropriate as long as it involves taking advantage of the capacity shortage in some way.\nb. Potential Risks\n• Biologics manufacturers aren’t interested in ramping up capacity, prefer to try and drive prices up.\n• We don’t have any expertise in services.\n• The market for services may be saturated.\nc. Next Steps\n• Speak to our customers to ensure this is a viable model.\n• Assess our own expertise.\n• Assess the market for services.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: increase sales; operations strategy.\nConsulting Firm: Simon-Kucher & Partners (SKP)  first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: healthcare: pharmaceutical, biotech, life sciences.\nCase Interview Question #01091: Our client is Petvascent, a pharmaceutical company that makes drugs for pets such as dogs and cats. One of the client’s leading products is Clean Heart, a drug that is given to dogs with heart worms. Dog heartworm is a parasitic roundworm that is spread from host to host through the bites of mosquitoes. The parasite is commonly called “heartworm”; however, adults often reside in the pulmonary arterial system (lung arteries), as well as the heart, and a major effect on the health for the animal is a manifestation of damage to the lung vessels and tissues.\nThe year is 2012. Our client Petvascent’s leading drug Clean Heart has recently suffered declining sales. The CEO of Petvascent has hired our consulting firm to determine what the problem is and how to restore sales growth. How would you go about it? What recommendations would you give to the CEO of Petvascent?\nAdditional Information: (to be provided upon request) \n• Once prescribed, Clean Heart is taken weekly for one year.\n• The client Petvascent has a patent on Clean Heart that will expire in year 2020 (current year is 2012).\n• There are other medications on the market for dog heart worms, but none is as effective as Clean Heart.\n• There have been no changes in the proportion of dogs diagnosed with heart worms.\n• Petvascent has an exclusive distribution agreement with PetCo, a national chain of pet stores, and also sells to vets so they can provide an initial dose to patients, who are then 95% more likely to purchase Clean Heart in pet stores.\n• However, PetCo has recently complained that Clean Heart is available at other pet stores at a lower price, a clear violation of the exclusive distribution agreement.\n• The Interviewer should begin by showing Exhibit #1, and ask the candidate to analyze the chart.\nPossible Answers:\n1. Case Overview\nThe candidate will ultimately discover that some vets are making large purchases of Clean Heart at wholesale prices and selling them to other pet stores. While this is a grey area in the law, it is ultimately not illegal and the candidate must determine a creative way to restrict this practice. In addition, the candidate must consider the implications of their method for preventing the redistribution of the drug.\n2. Suggested Order for Case\n• Read prompt & answer clarifying questions\n– Candidate should lay out framework\n• Guide candidate to investigating competitors\n– Hand out Exhibit #1\n– Ask Question 1\n• Steer candidate to what could possibly cause a decline in revenue\n– Price decrease vs. unit sales decrease\n• Give Exhibit #2 to discuss unit sales\n– Ask Question 2\n– Candidate should calculate profit and % change in profits\n• Why would vet purchases increase so much?\n– If necessary, remind the candidate of lower priced Clean Heart available in stores outside of exclusive agreement with PetCo.\n• Knowing that vets are re-selling to other pet stores, what steps should Petvascent take?\n– Re-selling is not illegal if box is not clearly labeled\n– Besides changing label, the client could: (1) Limit purchases by vets; (2) Change purchase agreements\n• What are the risks of those steps?\n• Recommendation\n3. Suggested Framework\n(1) Vets\n• Prescription rate\n– Alternative treatments\n• Relations with Petvascent\n(2) Pet Owners\n• Trends in pet ownership\n– Frequency at vet: # diagnosed, # undiagnosed\n– Fewer dogs\n• Affordability\n– Seeking cheaper drugs\n– No treatment\n(3) Pet Drug Companies\n• Marketing\n– Quantity\n– Type\n• New entrants\n– Pricing\n– Differentiators\n(4) PetCo\n• Pricing\n– Increase in real price\n• In store\n– Change in displays\n• Retail competitors\n– Online\n– Other pet stores\n(5) Petvascent\n• Unit sales\n– Patent?\n• Wholesale pricing\n• Marketing\n4. Detailed Analysis\nQuestion #1: (Give the candidate Exhibit #1) What does this chart indicate about Petvascent’s position in the market?\nExhibit #1: Revenues from heart worm drugs by Competitor ($ millions)\n\n\n\n\nGrowth Rate\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n\n\nMarket\nn/a\n2.40%\n2.74%\n5.72%\n8.81%\n12.20%\n2.70%\n1.23%\n-4.36%\n-0.09%\n0.10%\n-1.66%\n\n\nClient\nn/a\n2.97%\n3.57%\n3.43%\n3.11%\n3.76%\n2.76%\n3.07%\n-4.69%\n-0.91%\n-1.06%\n-1.76%\n\n\n\nPossible Solution:\n• Our client Petvascent is the clear market leader.\n• From 2008-2011, Petvascent’s revenue declines faster than the market and is dragging the market size down.\n• Two new entrants (Competitor H and I) appeared in 2005, neither appears to have grown significantly.\n• Bonus: Other players in the market appear to be fairly stable, indicating that no one is stealing share from Petvascent.\nThe candidate should now investigate other reasons that sales may have declined.\nPotential Areas for Analysis\n(1) Vets\n• Have slightly increased recommendations of Petvascent.\n• Most vets continue to order the same amount, a few have vastly increased their orders.\n• View Petvascent positively\n(2) Pet Owners\n• Continue to own dogs at similar rates.\n• Continue to take pets to vets at same rates.\n• Continue to follow instructions from vets with same variety.\n• Continue to spend money on pet medication.\n• Trust in Clean Heart as best medication.\n(3) Pet Drug Companies\n• There have been new entrants.\n• However, no new drugs have made significant improvements and remain low-level players.\n• No changes in marketing quantity or type.\n• No changes in price\n(4) PetCo\n• Observed declining unit sales.\n• Orders replacements to replace sales.\n• Has continued to price at $20/unit.\n• Angered by presence of Clean Heart in other stores.\n• Other stores charging $17/unit.\n• Maintains online store presence that is comparable with industry leaders.\n• Same marketing and display.\n(5) Petvascent\n• No changes to marketing, in quality or type.\n• No changes to wholesale pricing.\n• Unit sales have actually increased (show Exhibit #2)\n• Charges $17/unit to PetCo.\n• Charges $10/unit to vets.\n• Continues to only distribute Clean Heart through PetCo and Vets.\n• No change to packaging.\nExhibit #2: Petvascent’s Unit Sales of Clean Heart by Distribution\n\nQuestion #2: Estimate 2009 & 2010 profits. What is the % change in profit level?\nVet Price: $10\nPetCo Price: $17\nRaw materials: $5/unit\nPackaging: $0.5/unit\nTransportation: $1/unit\nMarketing Cost: $100M (2009) and $110M (2010)\nSG&A: $50M (2009) and $55M (2010)\nPossible Solution:\n• The candidate must estimate units and revenue in each year from Exhibit #2; allow any reasonable estimate.\n• The candidate should sum the variable costs to find a single figure.\n• If the candidate asks, allow reasonable rounding.\n• Subtract points if the candidate fails to find the % change in profit level without prompting.\n\n\n\nYear\n2009\n2010\n\n\nRevenues\n\n\n\n\nVet Units\n15M\n18M\n\n\nVet Price\n$10.00\n$10.00\n\n\nPetCo Units\n22M\n20M\n\n\nPetCo Price\n$17.00\n$17.00\n\n\nTotal Revenues\n$524M\n$520M\n\n\nCosts\n\n\n\n\nTotal Units\n37M\n38M\n\n\nVariable Costs\n$6.50\n$6.50\n\n\nTotal VC\n$240.5M\n$247M\n\n\nMarketing\n$100M\n$110M\n\n\nSG&A\n$50M\n$55M\n\n\nTotal Costs\n$390.5M\n$412M\n\n\nProfit\n\n\n\n\nTotal Revenues\n$524M\n$520M\n\n\nTotal Costs\n$390.5M\n$412M\n\n\nProfit\n$133.5M\n$108M\n\n\n% Change\n\n-19%\n\n\n\n5. Conclusion\na. Sample Recommendation\n• Revenues have declined because vets are reselling Clean Heart to competing retailers at a lower price, which undercuts sales at PetCo.\n• To combat this, the client Petvascent can\n(1) add “Not for Resale” label to packaging;\n(2) change sales contracts with vets;\n(3) limit purchases by vets.\nb. Potential Risks\n• New sales contracts may alienate vets who are good customers.\n• Customers may have grown used to lower priced Clean Heart.\nc. Next Steps\n• Re-evaluate price elasticity of demand\n• Discuss sales contracts with vets.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new technology, new product.\nConsulting Firm: Simon-Kucher & Partners (SKP) first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: software, information technology (IT);  transportation.\nCase Interview Question #01093: Our client Square, Inc. (NYSE: SQ) is a financial services and mobile payment company based in San Francisco, California, USA. The company markets several software and hardware mobile payments products, including Square Register and Square Reader. Square Register allows individuals and merchants in the United States to accept offline debit and credit cards on their iOS or Android smartphone or tablet computer.\nThe client Square recently developed a proprietary mobile payment technology called “Tap & Go”. The new technology has been very successful, and they now want to leverage it to the cash-dominated public transportation sector. Square has asked for our help in commercializing Tap & Go technology for transit transactions. What would you do?\nAdditional Information: (to be provided upon request)\n• Tap & Go is a feature that allows consumers to make payment by simply tapping their debit card/credit card or mobile phone on a payment reader at checkout. \n• Tap & Go is currently used for small purchases (generally less than $25) at places like supermarkets, fast-food outlets, coffee shops, bars and parking lots.\n• Our client Square has a 5 year investment horizon (2015-2019).\nPossible Answers:\n1. Case Overview\nThis is an exhibit-driven case. The interviewee should base the analysis on the information provided in the exhibits and identify the most important data points.\n2. Sample Framework\na. Market\n• Market Size / Growth (What’s the potential of Tap & Go for public transit?)\n• Current Competitors / New Entrants (similar offerings?)\n• Substitutes (competing technologies such as the Google Wallet, Apple Pay?)\nb. Company\n• Customers (segmentation, average spend on public transportation, willingness to adopt new technologies)\n• Capabilities (patent, expertise with Tap & Go, partnerships that can be leveraged)\nc. Economics\n• Revenue:\n– Price (lump sum fee from retailer + per transaction fee)\n– Quantity (# of transactions)\n• Costs:\n– Fixed (R&D, SG&A, advertising, IT, support center)\n– Variable (cost per transaction)\n• Upfront investment\nd. Execution\n• Access to transportation authorities\n• Regulatory barriers\n• Money on hand for investment\n• Opportunity cost\n3. Potential Areas for Analysis\na. Market\n• Market size: See Exhibit #1\n• Competitors: There are two major competitors in the market, including Square. They both offer Tap & Go services.\n• Substitutes: Assume that the main payment method for public transportation is cash.\nb. Company\n• Customers: Commuters, the majority of whom have credit cards.\n• Capabilities: Square has a strong track record with Tap & Go and a good brand name. Since public transportation is currently cash dominated, it does not have strong relationships with transit providers.\nc. Economics\n• See Exhibit #2\n• Assume a discount rate of 0%\nd. Execution\n• No additional information to provide.\n• These points should be taken into consideration when assessing the risks.\n4. Detailed Analysis\nQuestion #1: (Present the candidate with Exhibit #1) Square has identified three key cities on which it would like to focus. As a first step, it would like to enter one city and service one mode of transportation. Based on the information we gathered and given a 5 year horizon (2015-2019), which city and mode of transportation should Square target?\nExhibit #1: Three key cities and two modes of transportation\n\n\n\nCity\nNew York\nLondon\nTokyo\n\n\nPopulation\n8.2M\n7.8M\n13.1M\n\n\nPopulation Growth\n0.9%\n0.7%\n0.8%\n\n\nGDP\n$1,406B\n$565B\n$1,479B\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubway\nNYC\nLondon\nTokyo\n\n\nAnnual ridership\n1.604B\n1.107B\n3.160B\n\n\nAnnual revenues\n$12B\n$13B\n$16B\n\n\nExpected Year of Implementation\n2016\n2016\n2018\n\n\nProbability of Implementation\n90%\n70%\n30%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBus\nNYC\nLondon\nTokyo\n\n\nAnnual ridership\n0.747B\n1.780B\n1.946\n\n\nAnnual revenues\n$5.4B\n$9B\n$11.5B\n\n\nExpected Year of Implementation\n2016\n2018\n2017\n\n\nProbability of Implementation\n80%\n90%\n40%\n\n\n\nPossible Solution:\n• Not all data points in the Exhibit are necessary for reaching a conclusion. The interviewee should focus on the most relevant information.\n• The industry in question is credit cards, and so the interviewee can assume that the main source of revenues will be fees (as a % of transactions). Since we don’t know anything about potential differences in the size of the fees, costs or penetrations rates, we’ll assume they’re the same for all three cities.\n• An expected value approach can be used to assess which city / mode of transportation are most attractive.\n– Expected Value = Revenue * Number of Years * Probability of Implementation * (unknown % fee).\n– For example, the value of the New York Subway is (%fee) * ($12B*4*90%) = $43.2B * %fee.\n– Repeating the same exercise for the New York Bus: $5.4B*4*80% * (%fee) = $17.3B * %fee\n– London: Subway = $13B*4*70% * (%fee) = $36.4B * %fee; Bus = $9B*2*90% * (%fee) = $16.2B * %fee\n– Tokyo: Subway = $16B*2*30% * (%fee) = $9.6B * %fee; Bus = $11.5B*3*40% * (%fee) = $13.8B * %fee\n• Based on the expected value analysis, the New York Subway seems like the best target. The New York population growth and GDP also support entering this market.\nQuestion #2: (Present the candidate with Exhibit #2) Our analysis of the New York subway market yielded the following results. Would the client Square be able to break even within 5 years?\nExhibit #2: Economics of the New York Subway Tap & Go Market\n\n\n\nYear\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n\n\nAverage Size of Transactions\n$2.5\n$2.5\n$2.5\n$2.5\n$2.5\n\n\nAnnual Transactions\n$3.75B\n$5B\n$6.25B\n$7.5B\n$7.5B\n\n\nAdvertising and Promotions\n$2M\n$1M\n$500K\n$0\n$0\n\n\nSG&A\n$50K\n$50K\n$50K\n$50K\n$50K\n\n\n\nLicense Fee: $250,000/year\nTransaction Fee: 0.2% of transaction\nTransaction Cost: $0.4 cents/transaction\nPossible Solution:\n• Upon request, provide the information that the upfront investment in the launch is $5M.\n• Square will break even in 2018 (see calculations below)\n\n\n\nYear\n\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n\n\nRevenues\nLicense Fee\n$250K\n$250K\n$250K\n$250K\n$250K\n\n\n\nTransaction Fee\n$7.5M\n$10M\n$12.5M\n$15M\n$15M\n\n\nCosts\nTransaction\n$6M\n$8M\n$10M\n$12M\n$12M\n\n\n\nAdvertising and Promotion\n$2M\n$1M\n$500K\n0\n0\n\n\n\nSG&A\n$50K\n$50K\n$50K\n$50K\n$50K\n\n\nProfit\n\n-$300K\n$1.2M\n$2.2M\n$3.2M\n$3.2M\n\n\n\nCalculations:\n• Transaction fee: 0.2% of transaction.\n– In 2015 there are transactions worth $3.75B, so the revenue would be $3.75B * 0.2% = $7.5M\n• Cost per transaction: $0.004 per transaction.\n– In 2015 there are transactions worth $3.75B. Given an average transaction size of $2.5, the total number of transactions is $3.75B/$2.5 = 1.5 billion.\n– The total transaction cost is hence 1.5B * $0.004 = $6M\n• Annual profit = (license fee + transaction fees) – (total transaction cost + A&P + SG&A)\n– In 2015, profit = ($250K + $7.5M) – ($6M + $2M + $50K) = -$300K\n• Repeat the same calculations for year 2016-2019.\n• Breakeven will be reached when total profits will cover the upfront investment of $5M. This will happen in year 2018.\n5. Conclusion\na. Sample Recommendation\n• The client Square should enter the New York City Subway market: it has a high revenue potential, a high probability of implementation and a shorter-than-required break-even period.\n• It would make sense to enter additional cities / modes of transportation in the next 5 years.\nb. Potential Risks\n• Our projections of the implementation probability and number of transactions may be inflated.\n• Response from our major competitor.\n• Regulations resulting from privacy and security concerns.\nc. Next Steps\n• Create an implementation plan for entering the New York Subway market.\n• Build relationships with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.\n• Analyze additional markets to identify further opportunities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

It is currently considering whether it should enter the emerging Internet-based grocery shopping and delivery market in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.\nIn the L.A. metropolitan area, two competitors have emerged in the Internet/at-home grocery shopping business and are rapidly gaining market share. One of the companies that has already entered the Internet grocery marketplace is Company Alpha’s major competitor in the traditional market (Company Delta). The other (Company Zulu) is a grocery chain that does not currently have grocery stores in the L.A. area, but has entered the L.A. area with Internet shopping and delivery services. Should our client Company Alpha enter the Internet Grocery market?  If so, how and what concerns should they have? If not, how do they protect market share that is being threatened by the emerging Internet grocery market?\nPossible Answers: \nGeneral Tips\n• Ask questions until you are confident that you understand the case question.\n• Listening is critical, take notes as needed.\n• Use a framework, and invest time in setting it up correctly.\n• Round numbers to quicken calculations.\n• Make clear conclusions and be sure to answer all question parts.\nStep 1: Understand the case question\nGoal: To exhibit your ability to listen actively, to understand business concepts, and to articulate a brief summary.\nAsk questions. Don’t rush. Ask for time, if needed. Explain your understanding of the challenge.\n“I would like to verify that I understand the problem. A leader in traditional brick and mortar grocery stores in the LA area is investigating whether to launch an Internet-based delivery service and what considerations should be considered with its choice. His current top competitor is one of two current online market leaders. Is that correct?”\nStep 2: Plan your attack.\nGoal: To define the analysis framework and key areas of focus that will inform your conclusion. Investing time in appropriately scoping the exercise will improve the clarity of your methodology and response.\nOutline the process you will take to tackle the problem. Distill your analysis into manageable concepts.\n“In order to assess whether Company Alpha should enter the Internet delivery markets, I would like to propose that we probe (a) the market potential, (b) the barriers to entry, and (c) the current capabilities of the organization.”\nStep 3: Take it in parts\nGoal: To comprehensively investigate each aspect of the framework you propose and react to the information you uncover.\nExecute on your plan, trust your framework. Expect difficulty, stay calm, and adapt as needed.\na. Market Potential\n• What are the customer bases for Company Alpha, Company Delta and Company Zulu?\n• What are the demographics of the L.A. grocery market?\n• What is the current market size of the Internet channel?\n• What are the demographics of the Internet grocery market?\nb. Barriers to Entry\n• What are the relative market shares of the current major players in the Internet channel?\n• How heavily penetrated is the market?\n• What are the key differentiators between the three companies?\n• How much would it cost Company Alpha to enter the market?\n• What would the margins look like?\n• What is Company Alpha’s cost position relative to major competitors?\nc. Current Capabilities\n• What would the impact of diversifying delivery channels be?\n• To what extent are Company Alpha’s core competencies (staffing, skills, technology) developed in a way that would facilitate entry into the Internet grocery business?\n• Which capabilities would need to be developed/outsourced? \nStep 4: Summarize and form your conclusion\nGoal: To summarize what you have learned succinctly and what implications you have derived.\nLean on your framework to structure your conclusion. Use what you’ve learned. End decisively. Ensure you answer all of the questions. Prepare for further probing questions.\nSample Recommendation:\nThe market potential would seem to favor Company Alpha. They lead their market, which is fairly mature and growing slowly, and the company appears to be slowly losing market share. The Internet channel shows potential to reach a different demographic with strong growth potential.\nThere are significant challenges presented by competitors, particularly Company Delta. While their early entry to the Internet market introduces a difficult obstacle, their focus on low cost and high margins has resulted in insufficient capacity and potential quality of service degradation.\nCompany Alpha is in an advantageous capability position having invested in IT and ordering infrastructure in recent modernization efforts. They have a wide, under- capacity delivery network and staff.\nI would recommend that Company Alpha pursue entering the Internet grocery market by leveraging its dominant position in technology systems.\nIf Company Alpha does pursue this market space, there are a number of considerations for minimizing risk and cost. In-house web development resources are likely the lowest-cost option but acquisition options ensures baseline market share and shorter time to market. Cross- platform promotions, bundled services and reward programs can ensure adoption from Company Alpha’s excellent existing client base. Analytics from the existing clients in the Internet demographic segments can be used to design promotion campaigns. A thorough review of the buy vs. build options should be examined and a detailed implementation plan with the input from key functional stakeholders should be completed.\n5. Key Components to think about during the case\nCustomers\n• What is the customer base for Company Alpha, Company Delta, and Company Zulu?\n• What are the demographics of the L.A. grocery market?\nGrowth ties to the Internet\n• Assessment of business opportunity associated with Internet grocery business\nCompetitors\n• Do others exist?\n• What is their market share, value proposition, etc?\nMarket share\n• What are the relative market shares of the current major players?\n• How heavily penetrated is the market?\nCost\n• How much would it cost Company Alpha to enter the market?\n• What would the margins look like?\n• What is Company Alpha’s cost position relative to major competitors?\nSuppliers\n• Who are they?\n• What would the impact of diversifying delivery channels be?\nClient’s Core Competencies\n• To what extent are Company Alpha’s core competencies developed in a way that would facilitate entry into the Internet grocery business?\n• Which capabilities would need to be developed/outsourced?\nStaffing\n• Do current staffing levels support entry into the Internet grocery business?\n• How competitive is Company Alpha in the labor market?\nKey Takeaways\n• Listen to the interviewer and ask questions.\n• Structure the problem and develop a framework.\n• Take some time to organize your ideas; don’t jump too fast to conclusions.\n• Focus on high-impact issues.\n• Generate a hypothesis and explore options creatively.\n• Make quick and accurate calculations.\n• Synthesize your thoughts and draw conclusions from your analysis.\n• Don’t rush into the analysis without developing an understanding of the problem.\n• Don’t defend your solution at all costs.\nRelated and Similar Cases:\nStop & Shop Supermarket to Offer Internet Delivery Service\nMarket Basket to Offer Internet Grocery in Boston\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "url": "http://www.consultingcase101.com/singtel-to-enter-u-s-wireless-market-via-mvno/",
        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: market entry.\nConsulting Firm: Siemens Management Consulting (SMC) 2nd round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: telecommunications, network.\nCase Interview Question #00940: Our client Singapore Telecommunications Limited, commonly abbreviated as Singtel, is a global telecommunications company based in Singapore. The company provides ISP (SingNet), IPTV (Singtel TV) and mobile phone networks (Singtel Mobile) and fixed line telephony services. With a combined mobile subscriber base of 500 million customers from its own operations and regional associates in 25 countries, Singtel is one of the largest mobile network operators in the world.\nThe year is 2003. Our client Singtel asks us to evaluate whether or not they should enter the U.S. wireless market. As an international wireless carrier, Singtel successfully operates in Asia and is now looking for international growth opportunities. They come to us to understand two questions: (1) whether or not they should enter U.S. wireless market, and (2) what key challenges they might face upon entry.\nSingtel intends to enter the US wireless market using an arrangement known as an “MVNO” (Mobile Virtual Network Operator), in which they will lease network capacity from an existing wireless network operator in the US, referred to as an MNO (mobile network operator) or Host Operator.\nPossible Answer:\n1. Big Picture Analysis\nBehind the Scenes: Give out the following information as the Candidate asks for it. He or she should ask detailed questions about the market, growth, competition (the interviewer can give the entire competition block at one time), and marketing.\nAdditional Information:\n(1) Market\nForecast for year 2004: 180M wireless subscribers in the U.S. with an annual growth rate of 10%.\n(2) Competition\nThe U.S. wireless market can be divided into three main categories:\nI. National carriers\n• This includes larger network operators, such as Verizon (25% market share), AT&T/Cingular (25%), Sprint/Nextel (20%) and T-Mobile (15%).\nII. Regional carriers\n• This includes smaller network operators, such as Alltel and Dobson.\n• Represent 10% of the market in total.\nIII. Other MVNOs\n• This includes Virgin Mobile, Tracfone, etc.\n• Represent 5% of the market in total.\n(3) Value Proposition / Target Customers\nOther MVNOs have focused on targeting niche segments, such as low-credit consumers, teens, and ethnic groups, using no-frills prepaid services. For instance, Virgin Mobile was able to capture 4 million subscribers.\nOur client Singtel intends to leverage its existing assets and experience, specifically next-generation handsets from Asia and a platform for mobile applications, to target high-end consumers.\n• These exclusive technologies are several years ahead of the competition.\n• They already have a successful wireless application platform they can replicate in U.S.\n• Although U.S. wireless data is under-penetrated relative to Europe and Asia, new 3G networks and entertainment services are expected to accelerate adoption.\nBetween 10% and 20% of U.S. wireless subscribers would be willing to pay for a premium mobile handset with wireless data services.\n2. Profitability and Breakeven Analysis\nInterviewer: How can we calculate the number of subscribers needed to cover the initial investment and the annual fixed costs?\nCandidate: First, we would need to determine the contribution margin of each individual subscriber.\nInterviewer: Here are some points that can help simplify this complex problem. First, you don’t have to discount the cash flows. Also, you can ignore the $10/month for data services (with 60% gross margins). Finally, you can assume that you get all subscribers during first year of service due to pent up demand for this business. Now, knowing these facts, what data would you like me to provide in order do this calculation?\nBehind the scenes: Let the Candidate ask for as many of these as they can think of. After they have exhausted the list, prompt questions that will let you give the rest. For example, make sure the Candidate asks about margins, fixed costs, investment costs, administrative costs, and customer statistics (such as tenure and minute usage).\nAdditional Information:\nAverage customer tenure = 4 years (48 months)\nRevenues\n• Price per minute = $0.06\n• Average monthly minutes of use (MOUs) = 900\nCosts\n• Initial investment = $25M (it will take one full year to develop and integrate new platforms with MNO before launching).\n• Annual fixed costs after launch = $25M.\n• Per customer costs\n– Marketing and advertising cost per customer = $100\n– Sales commission per contract = $50 (for 24 month contract)\n– Subsidy per handset device = $200\n– Average handsets purchased / contract period (every 24 months) = 1 (so 2 for 48 months)\n– Cost per minute = $0.04 (based on contract with mobile network operator)\nInterviewer: OK, now I think you’re ready to make some calculations. We’re looking for how many subscribers we need to get us to the breakeven point.\nCandidate: (The calculations don’t necessarily have to be done in this order; just as long as they get to the answer.)\n• Customer Lifetime Value = (average monthly revenue – average monthly costs) * tenure – acquisition costs\n• Revenue per month per customer = ($0.06 – $0.04) * 900 minutes * 48 months = $864\n• Customer acquisition/maintenance costs = ($200 + $50) * 2 + $100 = $600\n• Subscriber lifetime value = $864 – $600 = $264\n• Subscriber breakeven volume = Total Costs (initial investment + annual fixed costs) / subscriber lifetime value\n• Total fixed costs = 5 * $25M = $125M (5 comes from 4 years of customer tenure and 1 year of development)\n• Breakeven volume = $125M /$264 = 473K subscribers.\nKey Insight: The client company Singtel will need to sell close to 500K subscriptions in order to break even. Given that this is only 1%-3% of the premium market (10%-20% of U.S. subscribers, or 18M-36M) and Virgin Mobile was able to achieve ~10x that number, this seems reasonable.\nBonus point: if you remember the additional data services revenue we ignored ($10/month with 60% gross margins, or $6/month), you need less than half that number.\n3. Critical Success Factors / Execution Challenges\nBehind the scenes: Have a conversation about the potential challenges and other issues the client company will face in this endeavor. Ask questions, and let the Candidate brainstorm. A variety of answers are acceptable, but make sure that he or she is thinking about this specific market, and not just saying generic things.\nInterviewer: What kind of branding is necessary for this service?\nCandidate:\n• The client company will need to invest heavily in marketing and advertising campaigns to develop a new brand in the U.S.\n• Need to reward loyal customers and encourage referrals.\n• Will need to be powerful enough to overcome switching costs of changing carriers, including the loss of free in-network mobile to mobile calling.\nInterviewer: The company has no existing relationships with customers and will likely have to rely on a 3rd party to sell on their behalf. Evaluate some of the trade-offs between different options.\nCandidate:\n• Online: While an important, low cost channel, most customers will still want to experience the new handsets and data services in person.\n• Build Your Own: Maximizes brand control and customer experience, but requires significant capital investment, trained sales force, and locations in urban markets.\n• Carrier owned stores: Strong distribution capabilities, geographic footprint, and sales skills, but incentives may not be aligned to promote your devices/services over their own.\n• Big box retailers (e.g., Bestbuy): While they have expertise in selling electronic equipment and data services, it may be challenging to stand out from all of the other electronic devices sold in their channel.\n• Non-traditional (e.g., high-end department stores, jewelry stores): Although these channels may help differentiate as a luxury good and target premium consumers, they may not have the technical expertise to sell wireless services.\nInterviewer: How do you think the client company should go about developing content?\nCandidate:\nThey must understand the entertainment needs / preferences / habits of US consumers, which are likely different than current Asian customers.\nThey need to develop digital content for data services that is appropriate for US:\n• Localizing existing content (e.g., translate into English)\n• Licensing existing/new content from external developers\n• Developing new content in-house\nInterviewer: Are there any other issues you think need to be looked at?\nCandidate:\n• Customer service / billing\n• Handset logistics / maintenance\n• Extra charges for roaming, directory assistance\n• Regulatory environment must remain friendly\nInterviewer: What do you think are some issues to consider when partnering with an MVNO?\nCandidate:\n• Requires the ability to differentiate MVNO services from the network owner to avoid cannibalization.\n• Must target customer segments where network operator is less profitable (either through lower acquisition costs, longer tenure, or higher margin / month).\n• MVNO arrangement avoids capital requirements for spectrum and network rollout, but requires excess capacity of partner’s network.\n• Host network operator must be willing to accept some loss of customer control and offer competitive rate in exchange for improved network utilization.\n• Must also be willing to ensure network quality and customer support.\n4. Recommendations\nSample Recommendation: The U.S. wireless looks like an attractive market, and the potential for profit is high. The recommendation should also include some of the biggest issues/challenges to come out of the brainstorming phase, but overall, this seems like a good investment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "url": "http://www.consultingcase101.com/bausch-lomb-responds-to-threat-of-disposable-lens/",
        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: business competition, competitive response; new product, new technology.\nConsulting Firm: Bain & Company 2nd round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: healthcare: hospital & medical.\nCase Interview Question #00939: Our client Bausch & Lomb is an American contact lens manufacturer. Founded in 1853 in Rochester, New York, Bausch & Lomb is one of the world’s largest suppliers of eye health products, including contact lenses, lens care products, medicines and implants for eye diseases. Today, the company is headquartered in Bridgewater, New Jersey.\nThe client Bausch & Lomb sells lens cleaning solution, prescription long use contact lens, and trifocal/bifocal lenses. Recently, global pharmaceutical and medical device giant Johnson & Johnson (J&J) introduced the first disposable lens (consumers wear for two weeks then throw away). The J&J lenses do not need to be cleaned and offer a much better user experience. J&J spent decades developing not only the disposable lens, but also a patented automated  production process. Using their computerized production, J&J can manufacture the disposable lens for a tenth of the cost of our time equivalent offering. Already J&J has gone from O% to 25% of all new installs (first time contact prescriptions), matching the number of prescriptions for our client Bausch & Lomb’s product only six months after launching the product.\nShow the Candidate the following three charts:\nExhibit 1. Breakdown of Client Revenue by Product Line \n\nExhibit 2. Gross Margin (GM%) and Global Market Share by Product Line\n\nExhibit 3. Average Standard Lens Customer Spend (Client vs. J&J)\n\nInterviewer: What do you see? What should our client Bausch & Lomb do?\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate should ask for time to go over the three charts and build a framework.\nCandidate: Well, first a few observations. Our client Bausch & Lomb has a large share of the global bifocal/trifocal market (70%). While solution and general lens are nice complementary businesses, the money is in bifocal/trifocals. Also, it costs more to outfit a consumer with J&J lens for a year than it does to use our client’s product.\nIn order to make solid recommendations to our client, I would like to flesh out three key dimensions of our client’s dilemma. First, I would like to learn more about J&J’s new products, next I would like to explore how contacts/solution are sold, and finally I would further map out the contact lens market.\nI would like to start with J&J’s product.\nInterviewer: Sounds Reasonable.\nCandidate: Great. Can you tell me how the overall user experience of our product compares to that of J&J?\nInterviewer: The product is fabulous. In fact, 20 years later it is still the market leader (30% market share). People love it.\nCandidate: Obviously good news for our client. To clarify: the J&J product line includes Bifocal/Trifocal lenses?\nInterviewer: Due to the way the J&J lens is produced, it is impossible to create bifocal or trifocal capabilities.\nCandidate: That is great news for our client. A final J&J question: can we develop similar technology?\nInterviewer: J&J is years ahead in research and development (R&D) and controls all the patents that make the disposable lens possible. It may be a decade before we can offer a competing product.\nCandidate: OK. Let’s shift our attention to the sales channel. I do not wear glasses, but from what I know about contacts a doctor must write a prescription for a contact lens. Do doctors receive a commission from the sale of lenses or solution? Also, is the insurance co-pay the same for either product?\nInterviewer: The insurance co-pay is $35 for both products. Doctors do receive a commission on the sale of lens and solution, although most solution is not bought at the doctor’s office.\nCandidate: So Doctors are receiving around a 33% larger commission from selling J&J lens than our client’s product? That might be a problem. We know customers will be happier with the J&J lenses, and now we know that the J&J lenses have the same out of pocket cost to customers as our client’s lenses and Doctors have a financial incentive to sell J&J lenses. Also, given the cost differential it means that J&J is making a much larger profit per user than our client.\nInterviewer: Right. What do you think can be done about it?\nCandidate: In the short term, we might consider raising the price of our lens to ensure Doctors’ financial incentives are not a problem for our client. We should also explore training our sales force to counter the J&J sales pitch and consider running a sales contest for Doctors. All three might help stabilize our market share in the short term. However, our client’s conventional lens business would seem to be a cash cow. It has a good brand, large installed base, and steady profits – but no chance of growth. Our client should consider selling it while it remains attractive or our client could use the profits from the general lens business to expand into another area. I think it’s a great time to look at the product market. Can you tell me about any trends in the contact lens market?\nInterviewer: Well, other than disposable lenses, the other big trend is specialty vanity lens. Think cat eyes for Halloween or red tint for athletes.\nCandidate: Interesting. How many competitors are there in the specialty lens market? Also, is there any patented technology required to enter the market?\nInterviewer: The market is highly fragmented but growing. There is no proprietary technology. In fact, our current facilities could produce most types of specialty lenses today.\nRecommendation\nInterviewer: Oh! The CEO just walked into the room. Please give us a recommendation.\nCandidate: Our client Bausch & Lomb is facing a major threat to both its general lens business from J&J, as well as its solution business since consumption of solution is much lower for disposable lenses. Our client has a large established customer base it should work to protect for as long as possible. To do so, it should raise prices of our lens and increase our client’s sales force’s interaction with doctors.\nOur client should invest cash generated by its general lens business into buying a specialty lens producer, then work to consolidate its market position. All the while, the client should work to innovate and patent protect in the bifocal/trifocal market to ensure long term profits. It cannot compete long term with J&J disposable lenses, but it should be able to survive and grow by focusing on its core bifocal/trifocal business and seizing the specialty lens opportunity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: merger & acquisition (M&A); increase sales; organizational behavior.\nConsulting Firm: Ernst & Young 2nd round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: entertainment; manufacturing.\nCase Interview Question #00941: Your client Mattel, Inc. (NASDAQ: MAT) is an American multinational toy manufacturing company founded in 1945 with headquarters in El Segundo, California. The products and brands it produces include Fisher-Price, Barbie dolls, Monster High dolls, Winx Club dolls, Hot Wheels, Hot Birds and Matchbox toys, American Girl dolls, board games, and WWE Toys. Revenue in 2014 is about USD $6 billion.\nYour client Mattel is interested in potentially acquiring a smaller toy company named “Dolphin Co.” which sells educational toys. Dolphin is different from Mattel since it employs a direct selling model. They hire independent contractors (ICs) to sell their toys for them: these ICs find people to hold parties for them, and invite about 8-10 people whom they sell these toys to. The ICs are paid 20% commission. If the ICs refer a friend to sell Dolphin products and does so, that sale still generates 20% commission for the new IC, but also an additional, smaller commission for the person who originally referred him. This process continues and you get an increasingly smaller cut of sales from members that were referred by those you referred, etc. This “down-stream” sums up to approximately 10% commission total.\nDolphin has been losing revenues lately. Two years ago they had $35M in revenue, one year ago they had $28M, and this year they have $20M. This year they are operating at zero profitability – breakeven.\nAlthough the cost of the acquisition is not significant due to their relative sizes, Mattel wants to have a company that can pay its own way. Your consulting firm has been hired to advise Mattel on this acquisition. Specifically, you have been asked to address two questions:\n(1) What do both parties have to gain from this acquisition?\n(2) Why is Dolphin losing revenues and what can they do about it?\nPossible Answer: \n1. Suggested Structure\nThere are two questions to address in this case. Let the candidate decide whether to keep the questions sequence, or identify question (2) as higher priority. If the candidate keeps the original sequence, keep the discussion on question (1) brief.\nFor question (1), relevant buckets are: revenue synergies, cost synergies, Mattel itself, and the educational toy industry.\nFor question (2), relevant buckets are: external vs. internal factors, decrease in price vs. decrease in quantity.\n2. Additional Information (Give when prompted by Candidate):\n• The educational toy market is growing at a rate of 3%; overall toy market is flat.\n• Dolphin Co. is the only company currently selling educational toys with direct sales method.\n• There were no recent competitor entries in educational toys.\n• Other educational toys are sold through retailers such as BestBuy, Target and Wal-mart.\n• Mattel does not have any educational toys now, but other large toy manufacturers such as Hasbro and Nintendo do.\n3. Analysis\nInterviewer: Why might Dolphin Co. be losing revenue?\nNote: Let the candidate brainstorm some internal factors such as market saturation, old or unpreferred products, prices are too high, or not enough sales force. However, let the candidate know that Dolphin products are in high demand and that although price premium should be assumed for this selling model, people are willing to pay for it. In fact, many people complain that they cannot find a party when they want to. This is because recently the number of independent contractors (ICs) has been declining at 10%. Although IC’s are being added, more ICs are leaving than joining. However, data shows that average party revenue remains constant at $200.\nCandidate: Dolphin’s decline in revenue is not an external factor since the market is growing. There is demand for this product which means we are not distributing it sufficiently. IC’s are declining at 10% – however, this does not account for the total decline in revenue (which is >20% per year) and revenue per party is constant, so each IC must be putting on less parties.\nInterviewer: Why is each IC holding less parties than before?\nCandidate: Their compensation may not be incentivizing them enough or they may be having a hard time finding the right areas to hold their parties.\nInterviewer: Correct, Dolphin parties generate on average $200. The IC commission rate is 20%, so $40 per party. Industry average (similar job functions) is 30% with party revenue of $300, so $90 per party. These sellers may pursue multiple jobs and prefer to hold parties for products other than Dolphin. Management believes that by increasing commission rate to 30% but maintaining “downstream” rate the same, the number of parties will double. Assume these parties still have $200 sales on average. Will this solve their company’s problems? (The candidate should be concerned about this statement since their new commission, while improved, is still lower than industry average.)\nProvide the following cost structure when asked:\n• COGS = 50%\n• Fixed Costs = 20%\n• Selling Cost = commission + “downstream”\nThe candidate should create the following chart:\n\n\n\nBefore\nAfter Commission Change\n\n\nRevenues\n$20M\n$40M (sales doubles)\n\n\nCOGS \n$10M (because we know COGS = 50% of costs, and that costs = revenues since this is breakeven year)\n $20M\n\n\nFixed Costs\n $4M (fixed costs = 20% of costs)\n$4M\n\n\nSelling Costs\n $6M (20% IC; 10% downstream, therefore 30% of $20M revenue)\n $16M (30% IC; 10% downstream, therefore 40% of $40M revenue)\n\n\nTotal Costs \n$20M \n$40M\n\n\nProfit\n 0 \n0\n\n\nCandidate: Increasing the commission rate to 30% gives us no difference in profitability, and the doubling of parties held seems unlikely. Perhaps we can increase commission further to determine impact on profitability or explore other distribution channels.\nInterviewer: How do you think Mattel and Dolphin can help each other in this respect? i.e. revisit Question (1)\nCandidate: In terms of revenue synergies, Dolphin benefits by using Mattel’s current store distribution channels. Because they are in high demand they should do well in the stores as well. This will solve the profitability problem for Dolphin as a stand-alone business, and Mattel does not acquire a money-losing business unit. Mattel can gain brand loyalty by entering the educational toy market and exposing customers to their other products, and improve its competitive position relative to other large toy manufacturers.\nIn terms of cost synergies, all toys are made from similar physical materials, so an acquisition might allow both companies to share manufacturing facilities and streamline its operations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: private equity & investment; growth.\nConsulting Firm: Bain & Company first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: restaurant & food service.\nCase Interview Question #00943: Bain Capital is a global alternative investment firm based in Boston, Massachusetts. It specializes in private equity, venture capital and credit products. Bain Capital invests across a range of industry sectors and geographic regions. As of June 2014, the firm managed more than $75 billion of investor capital across its various investment platforms.\nDomino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE: DPZ) is an American fast food restaurant chain and international franchise pizza delivery corporation headquartered at the Domino Farms Office Park in Ann Arbor Charter Township, Michigan, United States, near Ann Arbor, Michigan. Founded in 1960, Domino’s is the second-largest pizza chain in the United States (after Pizza Hut) and the largest worldwide, with more than 10,000 corporate and franchised stores in 70 countries.\nIn 1998, after 38 years of ownership, Domino’s founder Tom Monaghan announced his retirement, sold 93% of the company to Bain Capital for about $1 billion.\nOur client is Bain Capital. Back in 1998, Bain Capital just bought Domino’s Pizza. They wanted to identify a growth strategy for the chain. What would you recommend?\nPossible Answer:\n1. Industry Landscape\nNote: Let the interviewee make their structure. It should include a section on the industry landscape. Propose starting from there.\nInterviewer: Let me give you a background on the U.S. pizza industry. There are four national players.\n(1) Pizza Hut: market leader; owns mainly sit-down stores but also offers some delivery.\n(2) Domino’s: no sit-down restaurants, no carry-outs; entire operation is built around delivery; 80% of the stores are franchisees and 20% are company-owned.\n(3) Little Caesar’s: marketing campaign is 2 pies for the price of 1; restaurants are cafeteria-style, they offer carry-out; there is no delivery.\n(4) Papa John’s: new player in the market with very fast growth; no sit-down restaurants; their entire model is carry-out because their stores are located on high foot traffic streets so that people can pick up and go; their marketing strategy is “better ingredients, better pizza”. However, when we conducted a blind taste test, we noticed that despite the fact people showed little taste preference between the four types of pizza, when the brand names were put on the pizza, people went with Papa John’s.\n2. Identifying Growth Opportunities\nInterviewer: So what’s the first thing you would look at to grow Domino’s business?\nBehind the scenes: There are a variety of good answers to this question. Let the interviewee offer a few, hone in on the suggestion to open more stores, when they say that.\nInterviewer: What are some things you’d look into to identify where to open new stores?\nCandidate: Again, there are a lot of factors to be considered. Let the interviewee brainstorm the following list. Don’t let him or her get away with simple listing the concept; make sure they get to a couple of the details in each point.\n• Best Practices: Look at where we have stores right now and which of them are doing well to see in what type of places we do profitable business.\n• Competitors: Look at regions where there is not a high concentration of competitors, find those places and be the first mover. (To show you are digging a level deeper, be sure to touch on the point that when saying competitors, they might also include other similar fast food restaurants – like McDonald’s, KFC, Burger King, etc.)\n• Cost structure: Look at places where labor and rent prices are affordable.\n• Demographics: Pizza is a “youth” trend (Age: 13-35).\n• Income: You actually don’t want a high income level neighborhood because then those people would want to go to high end sit down restaurants and not Domino’s. Income level should be low-middle.\n• Growth: population is growing, at the least it should not be decreasing.\n• Presence of Domino’s: Is there a place where Domino’s has no presence, then we could move there given that we see enough demand.\n• Growth for pizza demand: Identify places where general demand for pizza is going up.\nThe interviewee should wrap this up by saying something like, “Most and ideally all of these factors should go hand-in-hand for us to open new stores.”\n3. Store Specifics\nInterviewer: OK, so what kind of place would be good to look at opening stores?\nCandidate: There are lot of answers that could be given. Ask for the reasoning behind the suggestions. Here are a few examples.\n• University neighborhood: fits demographic of low income and young; students tend to order to their dorm rooms rather than carrying-out, which fits Domino’s current strengths, the number of students universities take each year usually increases, leading to a growth in the market.\n• Other good answers include: suburban strip malls, vicinity of office parks, near suburban schools, near sporting facilities.\n4. Math by Store\nInterviewer: OK, let’s change gears. I told you earlier that we are mostly a franchisee business. Let me give you some data. Luigi, one of our franchisees, has seen that now he sells 100 pizzas per day and charges $10 per pizza. If he charges $11 per pizza, he’ll sell 90 pizzas per day. Should he do it?\nBehind the scenes: Make sure the interviewee asks for the cost data; Don’t just give it out.\nCandidate: This will depend on his profits. What are his costs per pizza? (Bonus points for saying that you don’t need to ask about fixed costs, because in the short run they will be the same in both cases).\nInterviewer: Costs are 6 dollars per pizza. Now, you should be able to calculate.\nCandidate: (the interviewer should watch him or her go through the math)\n• Current margin: $10 – $6 = $4 profit per pizza\n• Current profit: 100 pizzas/day * $4/pizza = $400 per day\n• Projected margin: $11 – $6 = $5 profit per pizza\n• Projected profit: 90 pizzas/day * $5/pizza = $450 per day\nKey Insight: Luigi should do it. He gets $50 more per day.\n5. Looking at the Chain\nInterviewer: OK, now let’s look at the Domino’s chain as a whole, and not just a single store. Would this benefit Domino’s overall?\nCandidate: Should remember that Domino’s is mostly a franchise business. Should also ask what the royalty structure is (i.e., how much Domino’s gets from its franchisees.)\nInterviewer: The franchisees pay 5% of their sales (revenues).\nCandidate: (should go back to math)\n• Current Revenue: 100 pizzas * $10/pizza = $1,000/day\n• Domino’s Revenue: 0.05 * $1,000 = $50\n• Projected Revenue: 90 pizzas * $11/pizza = $990/day\n• Projected Domino’s Revenue: 0.05 * $990 = $49.5\nKey Insight: The chain should not raise its prices, because before it gets $50/day and now it will only get $49.5. Domino’s should strictly control prices among its stores.\nInterviewer: What are some things Domino’s can do to control prices among its stores. Let’s first start with Luigi, who we left wanting to raise prices, and then on a national level.\nCandidate: First I would talk to Luigi and explain to him that this is actually a short term increase in his profit. Meaning that demand could be inelastic in the short term but in the long term people will just start buying from other pizza places and he’ll have lost his loyal customers. I could back this up by showing blind test results: taste-wise people actually think all pizzas are comparable except Papa John’s.\nOn a more national level, I would change the contracts with my franchisees and add in a statement about prices and the fact that they can’t change them unless Domino’s lets them.\nInterviewer: Let’s say Luigi’s contract was for 5 years and this is only year 1. Can you think of anything else Domino’s as a headquarters could do to discourage Luigi from increasing prices?\nCandidate: Well, I would think that Domino’s is doing the marketing and advertising on behalf of the franchisees. If that’s the case, we could say something like suggested price of $10 in the national advertisements so that when people would buy at Luigi’s store they would know the price is over charge and complain and this would stop Luigi because there is the danger of losing customers for him.\n6. Recommendation\nOpen more stores, don’t raise prices, and control franchisee prices to maximize revenue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: improve profitability.\nConsulting Firm: Siemens Management Consulting (SMC) 2nd round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: industrial equipment; electronics.\nCase Interview Question #00942: Our client Johnson Controls, Inc. (NYSE: JCI) is a leading manufacturer and distributor of HVAC equipment and control systems. HVAC (stands for Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning) equipment needs a control system to regulate the operation of a heating and/or air conditioning system. Usually a sensing device is used to compare the actual temperature with a target value. Then the control system draws a conclusion what action has to be taken, e.g. start the blower.\nThe client Johnson Controls Inc. (JCI) produces, installs, and services HVAC air temperature control systems. Historically the company enjoyed rapid growth for over 20 years and became the clear market leader. More recently, however, it has been losing profit at a rate of about 2% a year. JCI has asked your consulting firm to help them understand what’s going on and how to increase profitability. How would you go about it?\nAdditional Information: If requested, share the following product information \n• The air temperature control systems consist of two primary components: digital readers and remotely controlled flaps that are placed in air ducts.\n• JCI bundles their air temperature control systems with installation.\n• JCI sells service plans (i.e. warrantees, maintenance, and repair) separately from the monitoring system.\nPossible Answer:\n1. Suggested Structure\nThe candidate should provide an approach that includes at least the following elements: Competition, Customers, Profitability, and Product Mix.\n2. Competition\nInterviewer: Provide the following information, when prompted:\n• There is little differentiation among manufacturers of air temperature control systems. The market is evenly split among several national players.\n• The competition tends to be more profitable than JCI.\n• JCI’s air temperature control systems can be serviced by JCI, by customers (in house), or by a 3rd party.\n• JCI cannot service a competitor’s air temperature control system. The opposite is also true.\n3. Profitability\nInterviewer: At this point, ask the Candidate to talk about why they believe that the competition tends to be more profitable, despite the fact that there is not great deal of differentiation among air temperature control systems.\nCandidate: The ideal response from the candidate will include at least the following:\n• Mix of product versus service\n• Mix of customers\n• Relative profitability or costs for each\nInterviewer: Once the interviewer has identified product/service mix as a possible driver, provide the following information:\n• JCI Mix: 70% Product (air temperature control systems/installation) and 30% Service.\n• Competition Mix: 60% Product and 40% Service.\nInterviewer: Ask the Candidate what they think about the product/service mix.\nCandidate: The Candidate should observe that product/service mix may be a driver of JCI’s lower profitability – JCI derives more revenue from products on a percentage basis – But we can’t know for certain that this is true without knowing what the relative profitability of Product & Service is.\nA savvy Candidate should hypothesize that services margins should be higher than product margins, because there is keener competition between products (little differentiation) than between service providers (since services are tied to respective manufacturers’ product installed base). Once the Candidate recognizes this point, provide the following information:\n• JCI Product Margin: 4%\n• JCI Service Margin: 15%\n• Competition’s Product Margin: 5%\n• Competition’s Service Margin: 15%\nInterviewer: Now ask the following: Based on this information, can you tell me what the overall profitability is of JCI relative to the competition assuming that the margin percentages reflect the full cost of their businesses, respectively? (if the Candidate does not calculate it on his/her their own, hint him/her to)\nCandidate：\nJCI Profit Margin = (4% * 70%) + (15% * 30%) = 2.8% + 4.5% = 7.3%\nCompetition’s Profit Margin = (5% * 60%) + (15% * 40%) = 3% + 6% = 9%\nInterviewer: So based on this information, (1) why does JCI have a lower profit margin than the competition and (2) what if JCI could focus on one area, where should it focus?\nCandidate:\nCandidate’s answer to part (1) of the question: JCI has an unfavorable mix of product/service and profit margin on their product side of the business is lower.\nCandidate’s answer to part (2) of the question: JCI should focus on improving its service margins since that will provide a greater boost to profitability than improving product margins. Also, its service provides 4.5% points of its overall profitability of 7.3%.\n4. Customers\nOnce the Candidate identifies service as the area of focus, let them know that there are two types of services we provide: Break/Fix and Long-term Service Contracts.\nNow inform them that we’ve spoken with two of our customers’ CFOs who stated the following:\n– CFO A: “Purchasing a long-term service contract makes perfect sense”\n– CFO B: “Purchasing a long-term service contract make no sense at all”\nInterviewer: Assuming that both statements are correct, how is it possible that the two CFO’s statements are so contradictory?\nCandidate: The candidate’s response may include several possibilities such as financial reporting/metrics or CFO financial incentives. However, the interviewer should cue the candidate to think strategically. In this case, the correct explanation is that the CFO’s are supporting facilities that have varying degrees of tolerance for air temperature control system downtime (i.e. break/fix agreements). For example, office buildings versus hospitals.\nInterviewer: Once the Candidate gets to this point, inform them that the majority of JCI’s service business is Break/Fix (as opposed to Long-term Service Contracts). Now ask them to think about why this might be the case.\nCandidate: The ideal answer will reference the fact that customers will be drawn to service contracts depending on their business model. Businesses for who continuous temperature control is critical will likely gravitate toward long-term service contracts that prevent downtime. Businesses willing to endure temporary outages will likely opt for break/rix agreements. JCI does a much better job of selling service to customers with a high risk tolerance (such as office buildings) as opposed to those that have a low risk tolerance such as hospitals and pharmaceutical companies) due to the tremendous cost that temperature variations could present for their businesses.\nInterviewer: Ask the Candidate to think about how JCI could address this other group of customers that is more averse to risk (downtime).\nCandidate: Good answers could include:\n• Hire or build relationship with thought leaders in the industry\n• Retrain sales personnel to help push service contracts (educate them on value proposition)\n• Retrain service personnel to ensure they know how to service new group of customers\n• Advertising\n5. Recommendation\nThe recommendation should at least provide a response to both questions utilizing the findings from the case:\n(1) Why has JCI’ profitability gone down?\n(2) What should they do to rectify the issue?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have proposed instituting a change to the retirement benefits policy for all employees whereby every employee makes a contribution ranging from $500 to $2,000 to a retirement account and the savings grows tax free until the employee retires.\nWe have been approached by a financial services client Fidelity Investments. The client Fidelity manages a large family of mutual funds, provides fund distribution and investment advice services, as well as providing, retirement services, wealth management, securities execution and clearance, life insurance and a number of other services. The client Fidelity wants you to help answer two questions they have: (1) Is this a big opportunity? (2) What are the various possibilities and challenges they would face?\nPossible Answers:\n1. Suggested Framework \n• Dynamics of the mutual fund industry.\n• Incremental savings entering the mutual fund market.\n• Regulatory or exogenous factors affecting the mutual fund industry as a result of changes to existing policy.\n2. Additional Information: (to be given to candidate if requested)\na. Mutual Fund Industry\n• Companies solicit investments from wealthy individuals, retirement accounts, university endowment, etc.\n• Invest the money to create a well-diversified portfolio that typically minimizes risk.\n• Manage the portfolio and collect a fee.\n• Very large industry (over $1 trillion)\nb. Incremental Savings Entering under this new Policy\n• Last year, $170 billion entered the mutual fund industry.\n• Estimate the additional investment based on the size of the U.S. working population.\n• Assume recurring annual contributions and use $1,000/year to make it easy.\nc. Other regulatory issues or exogenous factors\n• No\nd. Can the client make money?\n• What is the management fee? 1% of asset under management (AUM).\n• What are the expenses? $10 annually and 10 basis points (0.1%) per $1,000 invested.\n• It means that for every $1,000 invested then, the client makes $10 in revenues but have $10 plus $1 or $11 in expenses.\n• But, in the second year when the assets grow, the client will begin to make a profit. If the $1,000 grows to, say $1,200, revenues now look like $12 but expenses are only $11.20. If you estimate how long a customer keeps the investment, you can calculate the present value of the cash flows to figure out a lifetime customer value to the client.\n• Plus, the customer would want to invest an additional $1,000 the second year.\n3. Sample Interview Transcript\nInterviewer: Is this a big opportunity? What are the various possibilities and challenges they would face?\nCandidate: I’d like to explore three broad areas in helping answer the first question – the dynamics of the mutual fund industry, incremental savings entering the mutual fund market and finally regulatory or exogenous factors affecting the mutual fund industry as a result of changes to existing policy. First, can you tell me more about the size and dynamics of the mutual fund industry?\nInterviewer: Sure. As you may be familiar, mutual fund companies solicit investments from wealthy individuals, retirement accounts of various firms, university endowment, etc. They then invest these monies to create and manage a well-diversified portfolio for a management fee. From the investors’ perspective, the creation of such a portfolio minimizes the risk.\nCandidate: Got it. How big is this industry?\nInterviewer: There are, of course, a large number of players. The total assets under management (AUM) itself could run in the trillions of dollars, so this is a very large industry.\nCandidate: Do we have a sense for how much new money enters the industry? I ask since this will directly help determine if the proposed policy change will be a big opportunity for the industry or not.\nInterviewer: I see what you mean. Based on our internal studies and analysis, last year about $170 billion was new money or additions to assets under management in the mutual fund industry.\nCandidate: OK, let me now move to sizing the incremental savings that is likely to enter the investment pool of dollars. I’m going to make some assumptions, please stop me if any of them are outrageous or unrealistic. My objective is to size the employed population of the United States. Let’s assume that individuals between the ages of 20 and 60 are eligible to be employed. If the life expectancyin the U.S. is, say, 80, and if the population is uniformly distributed by age. I know this is a big assumption, but for sake of this discussion, let’s make it noting that in a real-life engagement, we should be able to get a fairly accurate estimate of individuals in this age range from any number of databases.\nInterviewer: OK, that sounds fine for now.\nCandidate: So, about half the US population, or about 150 million, is eligible to be employed. I’m going to assume that the labor force, that is people that are actually employed is about 80% of this number. We are basically excluding homemakers, students, etc. who would be in the 20 to 60 age range. So we are looking at a labor force of 120 million. Figuring that the unemployment rate in the U.S. is running at about 5%, the actual number of people employed is about 114 million.\nInterviewer: Why don’t we just ignore the unemployment rate for now and assume a round number of 120 million?\nCandidate: Oh, this would make life easy. You indicated a range of $500 to $2,000 for retirement account contributions. Would these be recurring annual contributions?\nInterviewer: Yes. Let’s also assume that, since we don’t know who’s going to win, the contribution would be $1,000 on average.\nCandidate: Great. So the increase to the investable assets would be 120 million times $1,000, or $120 billion. Wow, that sounds like a substantial increase, given that last year the new addition to assets under management was $170 billion! Are there any other regulatory issues or exogenous factors that would govern or restrict how these assets can be invested?\nInterviewer: There are some stipulations, but let’s not worry too much about them for now.\nCandidate: Excellent, in that case, our response to the first question would surely be that this is a substantial opportunity for our client in aggregate.\nInterviewer: I’d probably agree that this is a substantial opportunity in aggregate. But how would you go about determining if is this a profitable opportunity?\nCandidate: I think I see where you are going. You mentioned our client charges some sort of management fee for services rendered. How much is this fee and what types of expenses does the client incur?\nInterviewer: Good question. The client charges a flat 1% management fee on assets under management. Simplistically, let’s assume that for every $1,000 invested administrative expenses on these assets like mailing statements, etc. is about $10 annually, while other operating expenses add up to about 10 basis points (0.1%).\nCandidate: Interesting. On every $1,000 invested then, we make $10 in revenues but have $10 plus $1 or $11 in expenses. That doesn’t look profitable.\nInterviewer: No, it does not, does it? Would you still think that this still a substantial opportunity?\nCandidate: Well, it doesn’t seem that way. Hmmm…Let me take a couple of seconds to think through this.\nInterviewer: Sure.\nCandidate: Ah, I think I see what may be happening. What happens in the second year when the assets grow based on the return earned? If we assume the $1,000 grows to, say $1,200, our revenues now look like $12 but expenses are only $10+$1.2 = $11.20. We begin to make a profit. If we know how long a customer keeps the investment, we can calculate the present value of the cash flows to figure out a lifetime customer value to the client. Then there’s the new $1,000 that the customer would invest the second year. So it does appear to be profitable, though I’m not sure how it compares to profits currently.\nInterviewer: Bingo! It is a profitable business. Right now, the size of each customer’s account is pretty substantial. It tends to run on the order of tens of thousands, so that the profit margin is much more attractive. We seem to be running out of time. Can you quickly summarize for me what opportunities and challenges the client faces, given our analysis so far?\nCandidate: Sure. There are a number of opportunities and along with it. Among the opportunities, the first is cross selling the mutual fund opportunity to customers of the brokerage and other services. This would result in enhancing customer loyalty and also increase switching costs, leading to higher customer retention. Second, emphasizing convenience, sort of the one-stop shop for financialservices idea, can enhance the client’s value proposition to their customers. On the challenges front, the most critical is probably competition. If indeed $120 billion additional funds are likely to be invested, every financial services firm is going to want a slice of the pie, which only underscores the need to cross sell and increase customer loyalty. This is something the client is going to have to deal with.\nInterviewer: Great. Let’s assume that you are riding down an elevator with the CEO of the client. And he wants to know what we think.\nCandidate: I’d draw him a 2 by 2 matrix, with industry revenue potential on one axis and attractiveness of this opportunity to the client on the other.\n\nI’d argue that the opportunity has a lot of potential for the entire mutual fund industry. However, the attractiveness to the client needs further analysis. There are a number of interesting opportunities that this policy change presents, but also a few challenges that the client will have to overcome in order to reap the full benefits.\nInterviewer: A matrix is always a good thing to draw; you already sound like a consultant!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: increase revenues.\nConsulting Firm: AlixPartners first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: publishing; financial services.\nCase Interview Question #01047: The client Morningstar Group (NASDAQ: MORN) is a specialized publishing company headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, United States. The company has 2 business divisions, one that prints SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) disclosures and another that prints mutual funds’ prospectus. In the first division, the shareholder communications are printed and sent to all the shareholders.\nThe client Morningstar entered the mutual fund prospectus business only 10 years ago, and since then this new division has helped the company to deliver significant revenue growth. The entire company had revenue growth of 25% over the first 5 years and then 15% over the next 5 years. The CEO wants to know why the rate of revenue growth has slowed down and what he can do about it. How would you go about it? What would you suggest?\nPossible Answers:\n1. Suggested Framework \nRevenue = Price * Quantity\n2. Additional Information: (to be given to candidate if requested)\na. Company:\nThe client Morningstar’s services are retained by Investment Banks. When a company needs to access the capital markets or make SEC disclosures, it is required by law to send the information to all its shareholders. The company uses an Investment Bank in order to access the markets, and the investment bank gives the information to the client, who prints it and hands it to the company, which in turn mails it to the shareholders. So the client does not produce content or maintain its own distribution lists.\nTwo business divisions:\n• Mutual Funds prospectus: $100 million in 2005, $300 million in 2010, $600 million in 2015.\n• Shareholder communications: $500 million in 2005, $1 billion in 2010, $1.7 billion in 2015. (Shareholder communications are responsible for the decline in revenue growth)\nb. Competition:\n• 3-4 firms that offer similar specialized printing services\n• No differentiation\n• Investment Banks only switch because of personality issues\n• Prices and services are more or less the same.\nc. Prices:\n• Prices have been constant.\ne. Quantity:\n• The overall number of investors has grown.\n• Market share has been constant.\n• No Internet effects.\n• Number of booklets printed has increased.\nf. How does the client company charge it’s customers?\n• Per page basis.\n• The number of pages in a shareholder communication prospectus has gone down.\n• Why?\n– Shareholder communication standards are mandated by the SEC, so the customers have to print what is required by the SEC.\n– In 2011 the U.S. SEC mandated the easy English usage rule, which forced companies to reduce all the legal jargon that was difficult to understand.\n3. Possible Solution\nWhat can the client do?\na Raise prices:\n• Client’s costs are much less than those of Investment Banks\n• Won’t result in customer switching\n• Viable option\nb. Increase quantity:\n• Gain market share\n– Few options to win other customers\n• Can’t print more pages because of the SEC regulation\n• Entering new markets\n– Annual reports (similar to prospectus)\n– Textbooks, etc.\n4. Sample Interview Transcript\nCandidate: Could you give me some more information about the client’s business? Does it produce content, maintain a distribution list, solicit firms directly, etc.?\nInterviewer: The client’s services are retained by Investment Banks. When a company needs to access the capital markets or make SEC disclosures, it is required by law to send the information to all its shareholders. The company uses an Investment Bank in order to access the markets, and the bank gives the information to the client, who prints it and hands it to the company, which in turn mails it to the shareholders. So the client does not produce content or maintain its own distribution lists.\nCandidate: Ok, let me start by looking at the revenues. Revenue = Price * Quantity. Could you tell me a bit about the pricing in this market?\nInterviewer: Prices have been constant.\nCandidate: Prices have been constant…this indicates that the quantity of prospectus printed has declined. However, given the bull market, the overall number of investors has grown, which should have resulted in an increase in the number of prospectus printed. Could you tell me about the client’s market share?\nInterviewer: The market share has been constant.\nCandidate: Then the other option is that companies are communicating to their shareholders in different ways. Have more firms started using the Internet to communicate with the shareholders, some service like ProxyVote.com?\nInterviewer: Let’s assume that online shareholder communication was possible. So ignore the effect of the Internet in this case.\nCandidate: Ok, so no Internet effects…but the prices have gone down, which then means that the quantity of shareholder communications must have gone down. However, this doesn’t seem reasonable since the number of investors has increased, and the number of stock, bond offerings etc. has also increased. Can you tell me about the quantity of shareholder prospectus booklets printed?\nInterviewer: Your reasoning is correct; the number of booklets printed has gone up. \nCandidate: The quantity has increased, the price has remained the same, but revenue growth has decreased this doesn’t make sense. Could you show me the revenues for the 2 divisions?\nInterviewer:\n• Mutual Funds prospectus: $100 million in 2005, $300 million in 2010, $600 million in 2015.\n• Shareholder communications: $500 million in 2005, $1 billion in 2010, $1.7 billion in 2015.\nCandidate: Ok, so the decline in revenue growth is due to the shareholder communication division. Hmmmm… Quantities have increased and prices have stayed constant… How does the client charge customers?\nInterviewer: The client charges them on a per page basis.\nCandidate: On a per page basis! This means that the number of pages in a prospectus have gone down.\nInterviewer: Right!\nCandidate: What could be the reasons behind it? You’ve mentioned that the client doesn’t have any control over the content. Could the customers be reducing the amount to be printed to control costs?\nInterviewer: Shareholder communication standards are mandated by the SEC, so the customers have to print what is required by the SEC.\nCandidate: Then it looks like the SEC is the cause of the reduction in number of pages per prospectus.\nInterviewer: Yes. In 2011 the SEC mandated the easy English usage rule, which forced companies to reduce all the legal jargon that was difficult to understand. So what options does the client have to raise revenue growth rates?\nCandidate: Revenue = Price * Quantity. The options before the client are to raise prices or to raise the quantity printed. It could achieve the latter by gaining market share, increasing the number of pages, or by expanding into other lines of business.\nInterviewer: Ok, examine the options for me.\nCandidate: Before I do that I would like to find out a bit more about the competitive landscape. Does the client have any differentiator? What is their competition like?\nInterviewer: There are 3-4 firms that offer similar printing services. There is not much of a difference between them. Investment banks use one or the other’s services for a while and then switch to another one if there is some personality clash. Prices are the same and so is the service.\nCandidate: Ok, based on that information, let’s take a look at the option of raising prices. The client’s services are required when firms access capital markets, requiring shareholder communication. When firms access the capital markets, they hire Investment Banks, and I would guess that our client’s costs are much less than those of Investment Banks. Is this true?\nInterviewer: Yes, it is.\nCandidate: Ok, then raising prices is a viable option. But I would like to check for competitive reaction. The Investment banks could choose a competing firm. However, you did mention that price usually doesn’t come into the picture, so I feel that raising prices a bit is a viable option. The next one is to gain market share. Is there any way that our client can differentiate itself? Can it build a relationship with some Investment Banks and provide better service?\nInterviewer: Not really, there are few options for doing so.\nCandidate: Ok, so that rules out the market share option. What about printing more pages? While the content isn’t under the client’s control, it could play around with the font size, formatting to increase the number of pages.\nInterviewer: No. Everything is mandated by the SEC, including the format.\nCandidate: So that option is ruled out as well. So other than raising prices, the client can increase revenue growth rates by entering other markets, say the market for printing annual reports (An annual report is a comprehensive report on a company’s activities throughout the preceding year). It is similar to the mutual funds’ prospectus market and can leverage its existing connections with forms, Investment Banks.\nInterviewer: Ok. What about entering the publishing of something entirely different, like textbooks?\nCandidate: That’s also viable, though I feel that the annual report market might be closer to its competency, given its mutual funds prospectus printing division.\nInterviewer: Very good.\nCandidate: (I should have been more structured, split up the 2 divisions from the beginning itself.)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

As a wholly owned subsidiary of the Spanish Santander Group, Santander Bank’s principal market is in the Northeastern United States. As of 2015, it operates 220 retail banking offices, over 800 ATMs (including 400 in CVS pharmacies throughout the Northeast) and employs approximately 3,000 people. Santander Bank offers an array of financial services and products including retail banking, mortgages, corporate banking, cash management, credit card, capital markets, trust and wealth management, and insurance.\nRecently, the client Santander Bank has begun facing threats from other regional banks, Internet-based financial services firms and other non-traditional firms. Deposits are declining and the bank has approached us to come up with a strategy to grow the bottom line. Walk me through some of the issues that you would consider and work streams you would set up in coming up with some recommendations.\nPossible Answers:\n1. Suggested Framework \nProfitability framework: Profit = Revenue – Cost = Price * Quantity – Cost\n• Price = Revenue per customer\n• Quantity = Number of customers\n• Cost = Overhead\n2. Additional Information: (to be given to candidate if requested)\nClient:\n• Santander Bank is a well-established regional bank.\n• Based in New England\n• $100 million in profit\n• 3 million customers, very loyal\n• Acquisitions strategy\n• Lots of products:\n– Deposits/savings accounts\n– Small investments\n– Credit cards\n– Mortgages\n• The bank is known for trust and security.\n3. Options to Grow\n• Grow revenue per customer by increasing the number of relationships or products/services that the client has with its existing customer base – a customer loyalty enhancing strategy.\n• Increase the number of customers by offering a wider variety of products.\n• Decrease customers that are not the high revenue generating customers – eliminate unprofitable customers from its base so that the number of customers goes down, while revenue per customer goes up.\n• Increases number of customers and increase the relationships or products/services with its customers.\n• Decrease costs.\nEach of these strategies will result in the bottom line increasing, but the choice of the strategy will be based on the client’s core competencies and the competitive assessment, along with a consideration of how the industry is likely to evolve in the future.\n4. Sample Interview Transcript\nInterviewer: Walk me through some of the issues that you would consider and work streams you would set up in coming up with some recommendations.\nCandidate: I’d like to structure the analysis along three broad areas, which would also form the work streams. I would like to better understand the client’s strengths, particularly their brand equity, customer reach and their history. Then I’d like to evaluate competitive trends, products and services offered and the value proposition that these competitive firms offer. Finally, I’d like to design the capabilities that the client will have to establish in order to grow their bottom line.\nInterviewer: OK. Where would you like to start?\nCandidate: Could you tell me more about our client, particularly about their customers, brand and history?\nInterviewer: Sure. The client is a well-established bank based in New England. They have about 3 million customers and an acquisitions strategy that has been reasonably successful. They offer a slew of products including deposits/savings accounts, small investments, credit cards and mortgages. However, they have been laggards in e-Banking.\nCandidate: Do we know how their customers perceive their brand?\nInterviewer: Well, they are a reputed and established firm. They are known for trust and security. They have chosen to remain a regional bank and consequently customers are quite loyal.\nCandidate: I see. I’m particularly intrigued by the fact that they are laggards in e-Banking, which segues nicely into the next area I’d like to explore – competition. Can you tell me more about the competitive threats they are facing?\nInterviewer: Competition has intensified both from traditional firms, particularly other regional banks and also from new, non-traditional firms. As you’ve probably guessed, Internet-based financial service firms are able to offer a better perceived value proposition to customers and the client feels that there is a strong threat of losing loyal customers.\nCandidate: I think I have a good feel for the client’s competencies as well as the emerging competitive threats. Do we know if the client is looking for new product ideas?\nInterviewer: Well, that would surely be one area to explore. It’s not clear if that is the primary focus of the client. How would you help the client identify how to prioritize the various options?\nCandidate: I’m sure this is not totally comprehensive, but I’d identify the major product lines the client offers customers. For sake of argument, let’s look at three products/services – banking products like savings accounts, brokerage services and say, retirement accounts. For each of these products/services, I’d then identify the different channels available – branches, the Internet, etc. For each of these channels, I’d undertake an analysis of value versus convenience. This would help segment the various products/services that the client can offer into various levels of service quality and value proposition.\nInterviewer: That’s interesting. What next?\nCandidate: With an approach I just described, I’d like to move to the final area that I wanted to discuss – capabilities. If we rank-ordered the client’s customers by revenue they contribute and plot a chart of revenue per customer and the number of customers, the chart would probably look something like this. I’m not entirely sure if the curvature is exactly as shown. Let’s assume this is illustrative for purposes of discussion.\n\nIf the client currently makes $100 million in profit, with 3 million customers, they are at point 1 on this chart. Their objective is to move to points 2, 3 or 4 at a higher level of profit, say $120 million.\nNow, point 2 represents increasing the revenue per customer without bringing in more customers. We can think of this strategy as increasing the number of relationships or products/services that the client has with its existing customer base – a customer loyalty enhancing strategy.\nPoint 3 represents an attritive strategy – eliminate unprofitable customers from its base so that the number of customers goes down, while revenue per customer goes up. This is a cherry-picking strategy.\nPoint 4 represents an acquisitive strategy where the client increases its customer base while simultaneously increasing the relationships or products/services with its customers.\nEach of these strategies will result in the bottom line increasing, but the choice of the strategy will be based on the client’s core competencies and the competitive assessment we have undertaken, along with a consideration of how the industry is likely to evolve in the future.\nInterviewer: This is great. So if you were in a meeting with the bank’s CEO, what would your recommended course of action be?\nCandidate: Based on our discussion, my preference is to recommend the strategy that leads to Point 4 – grow the customer base as well as deepen the relationships with the customers to enhance loyalty. This will probably be most successful in the long run. I must admit that this recommendation is based on our 20-minute discussion and wonder if there are other areas I haven’t explored.\nInterviewer: The point of this exercise is not to come up with a right answer. You did a good job. Thanks. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: math problem.\nConsulting Firm: AlixPartners first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: transportation.\nCase Interview Question #01046: Our client Birka Line is an international shipping company that operates 1 passenger and 2 cargo ships in the Baltic Sea, between Finland and Germany. Birka Line was founded in 1971 and made their first voyage in November 1971. Currently the company is headquartered in Mariehamn, Finland.\nThe client Birka Line’s ships are getting old and need to be replaced. The two choices before them are (1) to continue with the same configuration, 1 passenger and 2 cargo ships, or (2) to go in for 2 hybrid ships, which can handle both cargo and passengers. Which one is the better choice?\nPossible Answers:\n1. Suggested Framework\n• Current operating environment \n• Costs and benefits of each option\n• Potential showstoppers for operating the new hybrid ships\n2. Additional Information: (to be given to candidate if requested)\na. Current market\n• Lucrative market\n• Not much competition\nb. Costs and benefits\nPassenger ships:\n• Profits = $1,000 per person per round trip\n• Leaves port every other evening at 6 pm and arrives the other port at 6 am. Heads back to the original port at 6 pm, getting back at 6 am.\nCargo ships:\n• Profits = $2,000 per trailer unit per round trip\n• Leaves daily, one from each port at 6 am and reaches at 6 pm\nOperation of Hybrid ships:\n• Leave daily, one from each port at 6 pm and reach at 6 am\nc. Potential showstoppers:\n• No problems in changing the cargo loading time from 6 AM to 6 PM for the hybrid configuration.\n• The cargo would be in the hold, and won’t harm the passengers’ experience, which is mostly indoors anyway, since the Baltic is a cold, cold place and no one wants to stay outdoors.\nd. Capacities\n• Passenger: Capacity of 1,000 people, though occupancy is 600.\n• Cargo: Capacity of 120 trailer units, with a utilization of 100.\n• Hybrid: Capacity of 800 passengers, occupancy of 500 and capacity of 100 trailer units, with a utilization of 90.\ne. Growth Potential\n• The market’s mature, not much growth potential.\nf. Costs for buying/building, and operating the ships\n• Same operating costs\n• Hybrid ships: $250 million each to build\n• Passenger ships: $200 million each to build\n• Cargo ships: $100 million each to build\n3. Quantitative Analysis\nConsider the profits in each case over a 2-day period:\n• In the old situation, over a 2-day period there would be one round trip for passengers and 2 round trips for cargo, giving total profits of $1,000 * 600 + $2,000 * 100 * 2 = $1 million.\n• In the new situation, over a 2-day period there would be 2 round trips for passengers and 2 round trips for cargo, for a total profit of $1,000 * 500 * 2 + $2,000 * 90 * 2 = $1.36 million.\nIncremental profits = $0.36 million * 180/year = $64.8 million/year\nThen, consider the costs:\n• In the old situation, total costs of building 1 passenger and 2 cargo ships = $200 + $100 * 2 = $400\n• In the new situation, total costs of building 2 hybrid ships = $250 * 2 = $500\nIncremental costs = $500 – $400 = $100\nThus, the new situation results in ~$65 million extra profits annually. Given that the extra cost for the new configuration is $100 million, the client can easily recover his extra investment and increase the ROI.\nSample Interview Transcript\nCandidate: First, I enquired about the current operating environment. Then I examined the costs and benefits of each option and also checked for potential showstoppers for operating the new hybrid ships.\nInterviewer: The current market for shipping:\n• The market’s lucrative. There’s not much competition.\n• Passengers – Profits $1,000 per person per round trip on average. Use the ships for recreation; people stay inside since it is in the Baltic after all. The cruise leaves every other evening at 6 PM and arrives at the other port at 6 AM, and heads back to the homeport at 6PM, again getting back at 6 AM.\n• Cargo – Profits $,2000 per trailer unit for a round trip on average. The cargo ships leave daily, one from each port, at 6AM and reach at 6PM.\nCandidate: How would the hybrid ships operate?\nInterviewer: The hybrid ships would leave daily, one from each port, at 6 PM and reach at 6AM.\nCandidate: At this point I asked about showstoppers: change in cargo loading time, passenger experience due to the presence of cargo, etc.\nInterviewer: There would be no problems in changing the cargo loading time from 6 AM to 6 PM for the hybrid configuration. The cargo would be in the hold, and won’t harm the passengers’ experience, which is mostly indoors anyway, since the Baltic is a cold, cold place and no one wants to stay outdoors.\nCandidate: Capacities?\nInterviewer: The passenger ship has a capacity of 1,000 people, though occupancy is 600. The cargo ship has a capacity of 120 trailer units, with utilization of 100.\nCandidate: Growth potential?\nInterviewer: The market’s mature.\nCandidate: What about costs for buying/building, and operating the ships?\nInterviewer: The operating costs are the same. The hybrid ships cost $250 million each to build, the passenger ship costs $200 million, and the cargo ship costs $100 million each.\nCandidate: I then asked for a few minutes to check the numbers.\nInterviewer: You need some more information (heart sinking). The capacities for the new ship are as follows:\n• 800 passengers, with occupancy of 500, and 100 trailer units, with utilization of 90 units.\nCandidate: At this point I ran the numbers. I considered the profits in each case over a 2-day period.\nIn the old situation, there would be one round trip for passengers and 2 round trips for cargo, giving total profits of $1,000 * 600 + $2,000 * 100 * 2 = $1 million. In the new situation, there would be 2 round trips for passengers and 2 round trips for cargo, for a total profit of $1,000 * 500 * 2 + $2,000 * 90 * 2 = $1.36 million.\nThus, in the new situation results in $0.36M * 180 = ~$65 million extra profits annually. Given that the extra cost for the new configuration is $100 million, the client can easily recover his extra investment and increase the ROI.\nInterviewer: Good. That’s what we told our client and he made lots of money!\nCandidate: Other points covered include: In the new situation the passenger cruise operation is more dependent on traffic from both ports. In the old situation it could depend on traffic from just one port. So if the economy in one country goes down, then the new operation is less profitable. However, given that the ships operate between Germany and Finland, and not with the ex-USSR states, the chances of an economy imploding are pretty small.\nGiven that the actual problem was easy, I think the additional comments about dependence on economy and other such “soft” analysis helps. Feedback was that I cracked the case.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: increase sales; business competition, competitive response.\nConsulting Firm: AlixPartners first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: alcohol.\nCase Interview Question #01048: The client Brown-Forman Corporation is a multi-billion dollar liquor manufacturer began operations over 100 years ago. Currently, it is one of the largest American owned companies in the spirits and wine business. Based in Louisville, Kentucky, it manufactures several well known brands throughout the world, including Jack Daniel’s, Early Times, Old Forester, Woodford Reserve, Canadian Mist, GlenDronach, BenRiach, Glenglassaugh, Finlandia, Herradura, Korbel, and Chambord.As of fiscal year 2015 the company had sales of $3.6 billion.\nThe client Brown-Forman used to primarily focus on whiskey. Now whiskey accounts for less than 5% of annual sales. In the United States, the overall sales of whiskey were up 1% per year over the last 20 years and our client’s sales have tracked that. Last year, however, overall sales of whiskey were up 2%, while our client’s whiskey sales were down 15%. Why? What should they do?\nPossible Answers:\n1. Suggested Framework \n3C’s\n• Company: Sales = Price x Quantity\n• Competitors\n• Customers\n2. Additional Information: (to be given to candidate if requested)\na. Company\n• Price: Price has not changed.\n• Quantity: They have not sold as much whiskey this year.\n• Has anything changed?\n– 5 master blenders have implemented a new formula that reduces cost per bottle by $0.25 and have assured management that there is no noticeable impact on taste.\n– No changes to packaging.\n– No testing of the new formula. Did company do anything differently last year than it did in the previous 20 years?\n• Has anyone noticed?\n– 20% of one customer segment, “the loyals” that constitutes 5% of all customers but 45% of all sales has noticed and are “extremely angry”\n– 20% * 45% = 9% decrease in quantity.\n• Also need to consider the bottom line\n– Current contribution margin per bottle is $4\n– Margin before must have been $3.75\n– Before: 100 * $3.75 = $375\n– After: 91 * $4 = $364\n– Conclusion: Change in formula hurt sales and profits!\nb. Customers\nThe U.S. whiskey market is divided into high end, middle segment, and low end whiskies. Our client Brown-Forman competes in the middle segment.\nAt new whiskey bars, people will buy high end whisky to drink straight, but are satisfied with low end whisky for mixed drinks. Last year sales in the high end and low end whisky segments grew, but sales in the middle segment declined by 4%.\nc. Competitors\n• Our client’s main competitor lowered their price from $12 a bottle to $11 a bottle last year.\n• Our client only has one competitor in the middle segment and they split the market 50/50. (Use 100 as a base – each player sold 50 bottles of whiskey)\n• Last year, our client’s sales decreased by 15% and the overall “middle segment” sales decreased by 4% in size:\n– 15% * 50 = 7.5 decrease in our sales: from 50 to 42.5\n– 4% * 100 = 4 decrease in “middle segment” sales: from 100 to 96\n– 96 – 42.5 = 53.5 current sales for our competitor: increase from 50 to 53.5\n– Major competitor increased their sales by 7% in absolute terms.\n– 53.5/96 = 55.7%. Their market share increased by 5.7% to 55.7%.\n– 42.5/96 = 44.3%. Our client’s market share dropped by 5.7% to 44.3%.\n3. Solution\nWhat should the client do?\n• Change the formula back to appease the angry loyals.\n• Do targeted marketing to these loyals to let them know. This might be difficult, but will be necessary in order to move the whiskey upmarket.\n• Also, the company could reposition their whiskey as a more premium product. They should not answer the price cut of its competitor with one of their own. Plus, cutting price to regain market share would reduce profits even further:\nNow: 42.5 * $4 = $170\nAfter: (42.5 + 2% * 50) * $3 = $130.5\nThis is intuitive: we would be cutting out margin by 25% to achieve an approximately 2% increase in sales! The key for our client going forward, then, is better marketing, which makes the brand relevant in a changing market.\nSample Interview Transcript\nInterviewer: Why? What should they do?\nCandidate: Did the client company do anything differently last year than it did in the previous 20 years?\nInterviewer: Well, price has not changed. But, 5 guys, master blenders, implemented a new formula that reduces cost per bottle by $0.25. There were no changes to packaging and no testing of new formula, but they assured management that there was no noticeable impact on taste. However, 20% of one customer segment, the “loyals,” that constitutes 5% of all customers but 45% of sales, have noticed the change and are “extremely angry.”\nCandidate: 0.20 * 0.45 = 0.09\nSo, if angry loyals have stopped purchasing our whisky, sales will have decreased by 9% (since price has remained constant). But, before we can say that this was a harmful move for the company, we must look at the bottom line, profits.\nInterviewer: Okay, the current contribution margin per bottle is $4.\nCandidate: So, the margin before must have been $4 – $0.25 = $3.75, all other things equal. If we sold 100 bottles before, we sold only 100 * (1-9%) = 91 bottles last year.\nBefore: 100 * $3.75 = $375\nAfter: 91 * $4 = $364\nTherefore, the change in the formula has not only hurt sales, but also hurt profits.\nBut, the remaining 6% drop remains unaccounted for. Do we know if the market for whisky has changed in the last year? For example, I know that with the rise of cigar bars that whisky has become more hip recently. Is our client’s whisky targeted to this customer segment?\nInterviewer: Actually, it is not. The whisky market is divided into high end, middle segment, and low end whiskies. Our client competes in the middle segment. It turns out that at these whisky bars, people will buy high end whisky to drink straight, but are satisfied with low end whisky for mixed drinks. Last year sales in the high end and low end whisky segments grew, but sales in the middle segment declined. What does this table with market information tell you?\nCandidate: Well, it looks like sales in the middle segment, where our client competes, declined by 4%. I am puzzled, though, 2% of decrease remains unaccounted for, assuming our market share has not declined. In terms of the competition, have they done anything that might have resulted in our loss of market share?\nInterviewer: Maybe, what could they have done?\nCandidate: They could have launched a new advertising campaign? No. They could have increased their penetration in retail distribution? No. Hmmm…they could have lowered their price?\nInterviewer: Bingo. In fact, our client’s competitor lowered their price from $12 a bottle to $11 a bottle last year. If I told you that our client only had one competitor in the middle segment, taking a look at the table again, can you tell me how much their market share increased in percentage terms? Assume that our client had 50% and their competitor had 50% of the middle segment before last year.\nCandidate: Okay. Well, let’s assume that the total market 2 years ago was 100. We had 50 and they had 50. Last year, our sales decreased by 15% and the overall market decreased by 4% in size:\n0.15 * 50 = 7.5 decrease in our sales: from 50 to 42.5\n0.04 * 100 = 4 decrease in middle segment market sales: from 100 to 96\n96 – 42.5 = 53.5 current sales for our competitor: from 50 to 53.5\n53.5/96 = 55.7%\n42.5/96 = 44.3%\nSo, they increased their sales by 7% in absolute terms. Their market share increased by 5.7% to 55.7%. Our client’s market share dropped by 5.7% to 44.3%.\nInterviewer: So what should the client do?\nCandidate: The first thing they should do is change the formula back to appease the angry loyals.\nInterviewer: How do we let these people know that they have returned to the old formula? Remember, there was never any change in packaging, so this is not like Old Coke vs. New Coke.\nCandidate: Well, you should do targeted marketing to these loyals to let them know. This might be difficult, but will be necessary in order to move the whisky upmarket, which is my next recommendation.\nAlso, if the company wants to make their whisky a more premium product, they should not answer the price cut of its competitor with one of their own. Moreover, cutting price to regain market share would reduce profits even further:\nNow: 42.5 * $4 = 170\nAfter: (42.5 + 2% * 50) * $3 = 130.5\nThis is intuitive: we would be cutting out margin by 25% to achieve an approximately 2% increase in sales! The key for our client going forward, then, is better marketing, which makes the brand relevant in a changing market.\nInterviewer: Very good. Thank you!\nNote: This case highlights that multiple things can happen at once to create problems for a company. When doing calculations, you can assume 100 to aid when looking at the effect of percentage changes in market share or quantity sold.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Consulting first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: Publishing, Mass Media & Communications.\nCase Interview Question #01050: Your client Bertelsmann Group is a multinational media corporation based in Gütersloh, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It is one of the world’s largest mass media companies and also active in the service sector and education. Founded as a publishing house in 1835, Bertelsmann is now one of Europe’s leading media companies, with revenues of $22 billion last year.\nBertelsmann Group operates a book club, the type of club where you get 4 books free and are committed to buying 5 more books at retail price, which is usually less than at a bookstore. Also, there is a book of the month you get unless you return the monthly card. Historically, the book club model was a huge success in the United States. Recently, however, Bertelsmann Book Club’s profits in the U.S. are going down. What is going on? What would you recommend the client do?\nPossible Answers:\n1. Suggested Framework \nProfitability framework: Profits = Revenue – Cost = Price x Quantity – Cost\n2. Detailed Analysis\na. Price\n• Price remained stable\nb. Quantity\n• Demand hasn’t decreased in the market, but the client’s sales have.\n• Demand has gone to: Internet based book companies such as Amazon and Barnes & Noble, traditional bookstores, books on tape, libraries, and big box retailers such as Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club.\nc. Costs\n• Actual cost of books\n• Acquisition cost of customer\n• Cost of keeping a customer\n• Shipping Costs\nd. How do book clubs acquire customers?\n• Ads for these types of book clubs are found in magazines and newspapers. The actual price of the ads has not changed.\n• However, the prices have changed because of fewer customers, so the acquisition cost per customer has gone up.\n• As a side note, how would you estimate the size of the book market in the US?\nThere are 300 million people in the US. Taking out infants and illiterates I would narrow that number to 250 million. I would say on average each person buys 4 books per year. That would be 1 billion books at say, $20 a piece, for a grand total of $20 billion per year.\n3. Sample Interview Transcript\nCandidate: Well, to address profitability I would look at revenues and expenses. Under revenues we have price and quantity. Have the prices changed that you pay for the books or the prices you charge to customers?\nInterviewer: No, both prices have remained stable.\nCandidate: OK, then I would look at quantity sold. I would imagine that this is the problem. With all the competition in the industry, like Amazon.com, Barnes and Noble.com, traditional bookstores that have been expanding, adding coffee shops, etc, books on tape, libraries, etc. I would say that overall demand for books hasn’t decreased, but that your demand has, is this correct?\nInterviewer: Yes, that is correct. You are forgetting one important competitor.\nCandidate: Other book clubs?\nInterviewer: No, actually I am thinking of another.\nCandidate: I am not sure.\nInterviewer: Actually I am thinking of stores like Sam’s Club and Wal-Mart. OK, what else would you look at?\nCandidate: Well, I would also look at expenses. I would say there are four main costs:\n1. Actual cost of books\n2. Acquisition cost of customer\n3. Cost of keeping a customer\n4. Shipping Costs\nInterviewer: Good, except actually shipping costs are considered a revenue because they charge more to customers than they actually pay for shipping.\nCandidate: OK, Well the other things are costs. You have said that the price of the books has not changed. What about the acquisition costs?\nInterviewer: How do you think they acquire customers?\nCandidate: Well, I joined a CD club similar to this and I often see ads for these types of clubs in magazines and newspapers. Has the price for these ads increased?\nInterviewer: In a way, the actual price has not changed, but how do you think the prices may have changed?\nCandidate: If fewer people are responding to the ads, then in a sense the ads are more expensive.\nInterviewer: True, how would you calculate this?\nCandidate: Well, if the ad costs $10,000 and 10,000 people respond, then the acquisition cost is $1 per person. If now only 5,000 people respond, then the acquisition cost has increased to $2 per person.\nInterviewer: Yes, and as a side note, how would you estimate the size of the book market in the US?\nCandidate: There are 300 million people in the US. Taking out infants and illiterates I would narrow that number to 250 million. I would say on average each person buys 4 books per year.

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: growth strategy; organizational behavior.\nConsulting Firm: L.E.K. Consulting first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: retail.\nCase Interview Question #01051: Your client is an American party-plan selling company, which sells power tools through hosted parties. Tupperware is the classic example of this type of selling. The company has a small core of full-time corporate marketing staff that recruits consultants, who are independent contractors. The consultants then recruit hosts, who hold the parties. The hosts invite purchasers to their parties to buy the power tools. The hosts are compensated with a free gift and discounts on their purchases.\nThe consultants get a percentage commission of their hosts’ sales. In addition, the consultants can recruit up to four layers of other consultants and get a portion of their revenues. The party-plan selling company started eight years ago and has had explosive revenue growth. Recently, however, the rate of growth has started to slow down dramatically.\nThe client has asked you two questions: (1) what is the factor slowing growth, and (2) how can they improve the situation. How would you go about it?\nPossible Answers:\n1. Suggested Framework \nConsider the four layers of the party-plan selling company\na. Purchasers\nb. Party Hosts\nc. Consultants\nd. Central Marketing\n2. Detailed Analysis\na. Purchasers\n• The purchaser behavior has not changed – on average they buy as much and as frequently as before.\nb.

Consultants\n• Nothing has changed there.\n• However, the number of consultants being recruited has dropped, both with corporate marketing and via other consultants.\n• The incentive arrangement hasn’t changed.\nIt turns out that they have basically used up all the raw material in their area. What can they do now?\n• Expand into new locations in the U.S.\n• Direct corporate marketing efforts\n• Extra incentives for consultants\n• International expansion\n3. Sample Interview Transcript\nInterviewer: How would you go about it?\nCandidate: I would examine the four levels of selling to see where the problem is: purchasers, party hosts, consultants, and central marketing.\nInterviewer: Sounds like a plan.\nCandidate: Let’s start with purchasers. For them I would ask whether the average frequency and size of purchase has changed.\nInterviewer: Good. The purchaser behavior has not changed — on average they buy as much and as frequently as before.\nCandidate: Okay then it seems like the problem is that we aren’t recruiting enough new purchasers. Let’s look at the levels of purchaser recruitment. Are the party hosts’ behavior changed? Are they having as many parties with as many people as before?\nInterviewer: Yes, nothing has changed there.\nCandidate: How about the consultants? Are they recruiting as many hosts as before?\nInterviewer: Yes, nothing has changed there.\nCandidate: Okay, are the consultants recruiting as many other consultants as before?\nInterviewer: No, the number of consultants being recruited has dropped, both with corporate marketing and via other consultants. Why do you think this might be?\nCandidate: It could be because the consultants don’t have much incentive to recruit other consultants beyond the first 2 layers. If each consultant gets 10% of the sales of the consultant’s they recruit, then by the fourth layer, $10 in Consultant D’s sales turns into $1 for C, a dime for B and a penny for A — so A doesn’t care if D does well or even exists. Perhaps we need to increase incentives for the consultants by giving them more of a stake in increasing sales.\nInterviewer: Okay, but the incentive arrangement hasn’t changed — during the history of explosive growth we had the same incentives in place. Why aren’t they working any more?\nCandidate: Hmm. (I’m stumped.) Well, the key is to get new people — maybe the group of consultants that we have has just run out of new friends to recruit?\nInterviewer: Yes — it turns out that they have basically used up all the raw material in their area. Almost everyone who is interested in doing a power-tool party recruiting have already participated. So now, what would you recommend?\nCandidate: Well, they should try and spawn out into new populations. Maybe they should look at the map of their consultants and see if there are areas in the U.S. that they haven’t covered. Then if it looks like New Mexico, for instance, isn’t well covered, they should either direct corporate marketing efforts in that area, and/or give extra incentives to consultants who recruit other consultants in the target area. You could also look internationally.\nInterviewer: What would you look for in international expansion?\nCandidate: Well, I would look to see areas where DIY (do-it-yourself) was flourishing. For instance, I know that the UK has a very big, high-growth DIY market, and because of the common language, the UK is often less of a hassle to move into than other countries.\nInterviewer: Yes. Let me tell you what happened with this company. It turned out that party-plan sales companies usually are based on fads, and so they grow and then burn out. The top-level employees then move onto another party-plan company selling another product. We proposed international expansion, and researched a few countries. It turns out that party-plan selling is illegal in China, but very common and accepted in Latin America.\nCandidate: (In retrospect I think that the compensation for the four levels of consultants was a red herring, and I fell for it. I should have been concentrating on things that had changed since their sales started leveling off.) \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Recently, Bristol-Myers Squibb has been approached with the following business proposition. You have been asked to lay out how your client should evaluate the opportunity: A small hospital in West Virginia has developed a total cardiovascular health program for its outpatient population. The program has been in place for 3 years and has been highly successful in improving the cardiovascular health status of the patients as measured by several parameters.\nThe West Virginia hospital would like to “sell” this program to other hospitals for a fee, but could not undertake such a task on their own. Instead, the West Virginia hospital would like to license the program to your client Bristol-Myers Squibb, and your client BMS would market it to other hospitals.\nYou are asked to develop a methodology for evaluating this new business opportunity to license a cardiovascular health program from this West Virginia hospital and market it. They are not asking for a final Go/No Go answer. How would you go about it?\nPossible Answers:\n1. Suggested Structure \nPresent methodology for evaluating as a series of very basic Yes/No questions.\n• Does this cardiovascular program actually work and can it be applied with similar success in other hospitals?\n• What is the potential NPV of this business opportunity?\n• Are there other opportunities available to your client BMS that would create a greater return on their investment?\nIf the answer to any of these key questions is no, then the client should not pursue this opportunity.\n2.

Sample Interview Transcript\nCandidate: Ok. I want to make sure I’m addressing the key issue here – the client BMS wants me to develop a methodology for evaluating this business opportunity to license a cardiovascular health program from this West Virginia hospital and market it. The client doesn’t want me to come up with a final Go/No Go answer.\nInterviewer: Correct.\nCandidate: Do you mind if I take a few seconds to think a bit about the problem?\nInterviewer: Sure. Go right ahead. We’ll start when you’re ready.\nCandidate: I would present my methodology for evaluating as a series of very basic Yes/No questions. Of course to answer each question we’d have to go into more details, but I’d like to first lay out the broad framework.\nInterviewer: OK. I think that’s an excellent way to go about it.\nCandidate: First, does this cardiovascular program actually work and can it be applied with similar success in other hospitals. Second, what is the potential NPV of this opportunity. And third, are there other opportunities available to your client that would create a greater return on their investment. If the answer to any of these key questions is no, then the client should not pursue this opportunity.\nInterviewer: Very good. So why don’t we go through each of the questions and what I’d like you to do is to address the key issues you’d consider.\nCandidate: First of all, having had some experience with research on patients with cardiovascular disease, I know that study results are not always straightforward. For instance, I would want to know which parameters were improved – was quality of life improved, was overall survival rate improved? Also, I would be concerned that the results from the study on patients from this one hospital in West Virginia could not be extrapolated to other patient populations in other settings.\nInterviewer: So what would you recommend to the client BMS based on these concerns?\nCandidate: Since the client BMS is a major pharmaceutical company, I would guess that they have a fair number of research scientists that could look more carefully at this one hospital’s results and decide if the cardiovascular program could be successful if widely marketed.\nInterviewer: That’s fair. How about the next question, evaluating the NPV.\nCandidate: Well, obviously we’d have to look at the cash flows each year. That’s going to require some knowledge about the licensing agreement that would be place with the hospital.\nInterviewer: I don’t want to get into details regarding the agreements, or even specific numbers for revenue. Let’s try to keep this discussion as “high-level” as possible. What would be the major sources of revenue for your client if they pursued this opportunity?\nCandidate: The main source of revenue would be hospitals paying a fee for the rights to use this cardiovascular program, which conceivably could be on a subscription basis, per-patient, one-time…the possibilities are endless.\nAlso, one thing I didn’t consider is that if the cardiovascular program calls for specific types of medications, such as ACE-inhibitors, beta-blockers that the client BMS makes, this might present a major “crossselling” opportunity and boost market share for specific pharmaceuticals.\nOn the down side, and perhaps I’m being a bit too cynical about pharmaceutical companies – if the client is more involved with drugs required during coronary by-pass surgery and this program was actually successful and kept people from needing by-pass surgery then the client would, in a sense, be cannibalizing its sales of coronary by-pass drug sales.\nInterviewer: That is very cynical, indeed! Your client BMS actually has some ACE-inhibitors on the market that very well could be incorporated into the cardiovascular program.\nCandidate: Again, staying at a very high level, and looking at the costs – the licensing fee paid to the West Virginia hospital would be a major cost, and again, it could be structured in countless ways. Beyond that, my client would incur costs to market the cardiovascular program to hospitals, so there would be a marketing expense. However, if there is a core competency that Pharmaceuticals have developed over the years it might actually be marketing so this would be right up the client’s alley. In fact, if the client already has a strong hospital-based sales force they could very easily be used to sell this program.\nInterviewer: Anything else you want to add to the NPV question?\nCandidate: Yes – well two things really.\nOne, if the client were to get involved with a cardiovascular program like this that promotes health overall, I think it could have a very positive effect on consumer perception. Right now the pharmaceutical industry as a whole has been receiving very poor publicity for a variety of reasons, so any positive publicity for the client company would be worth something – it may be difficult to quantify, but I think it would be significant enough to consider.\nOn the other hand, if the cardiovascular program is promoted and it turns out that patients begin doing much worse (for some reason that was over-looked earlier) in the long-run, there is the possibility of materially damaging the client’s reputation as a company that delivers safe health care products. If the complications resulting from this program are very serious, the client may have to consider the possibility of law suits and damage payments.\nInterviewer: Should we discuss the final major question – What other opportunities does the client BMS have?\nCandidate: Sure. I think this is pretty straight forward. The client may have several other opportunities that it is considering at the moment. Some of these projects might have better returns, carry less risk, and perhaps fit better with the client’s core business of selling drugs.\nInterviewer: OK. That’s fine.\nCandidate: (This was one of my smoother interviews. Because I have a background in health care it was very easy to discuss this pharmaceutical case. We went on to talk about the cardiovascular program for another 15 minutes, but not in a “case” format.) \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new business.\nConsulting Firm: ZS Associates first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: e-commerce & online business; retail.\nCase Interview Question #01053: The client The Stop & Shop Supermarket Company is a chain of supermarkets and grocery stores located in the New York, New Jersey, Connecticut Tri-state area. Currently the Stop & Shop chain operates about 200 stores in the three states.\nThe client The Stop & Shop Supermarket is considering offering an Internet delivery service (i.e., groceries can be ordered via the Internet and delivered directly to your home). Including the client, there are three main grocery chains in the tri-state area, each with roughly 20% market share. One of them has already entered the Internet grocery market and is starting to gain market share. The only other grocery store currently offering Internet delivery service in the U.S. is a Midwest store.\nShould the client Stop & Shop enter the Internet grocery market? If so, what issues would they face? If not, how should they protect their market share?\nPossible Answers:\n1. Suggested Framework\n• Competitors\n• Customers\n• Cost\n2. Analysis\na. Competitors\nRegional competitor:\n• They began offering Internet delivery service about 6 months ago and approximately 1% of their sales are from the Internet. They are forecast growth.\n• Prices have been mixed with no noticeable trend.\nb. Customers\n• Internet grocery appears to be a small market (competitor is at 1% of sales).\n• Conduct a current customer survey to measure interest.\n• Conduct a new customer survey to determine new additions.\n– Obtain a listing of residents in proximity to each of our stores and cross reference them to credit cards used, “Price Club” membership, checks received, etc.\n– Determine who is not shopping at our stores and find out if they would use the Internet service.\n– Determine if consumers are willing to pay a premium for items purchased through the Internet to help with the pricing strategy.\n– Determine the potential market size figuring in cannibalization and pricing.\nc. Costs\n• Cost of web server and maintenance of it\n• Delivery and “order processing” personnel\n• Insurance for the delivery people\n• Inventory warehousing costs\nWhere can they store inventory? There are three options:\n• The client could store inventory at each retail store\n• Use the current warehouse distribution centers\n• Build a warehouse specifically for the Internet grocery service\nThe answer depends on the time frame and risk.\nd. Recommendations\nIn sum, the client Stop & Shop needs to determine the market potential, cannibalization and the cost of running the Internet grocery service. If there seems to be at least some demand and there is extra capacity in the distribution centers, the client should at least try the service for a little while. It won’t be too costly for them and this way, if the trend does begin to pick up, the client is ready for it.\nIf the demand seems low or the client decides to not pursue the opportunity, they do need to be careful about protecting their market share. Perhaps they can do that by emphasizing the shopping experience at a retail store. They can run commercials showing that it is more pleasant to roam the aisles in search of your favorite foods, rather than trying to recall what you like by staring at a computer screen. They can also use the surveys to determine if there is anything about their current retail stores that can be improved to keep the customer in the store, such as music, cleanliness, staff, etc. In this way, the client can meet the consumer’s needs in the retail store and entice them to stay.\n3. Sample Interview Transcript\nCandidate: I would focus on three main factors: competitor’s strategy, consumer demand, and the cost of running this service. I would decide whether to enter the market based on these findings. First, let’s look at the regional competitor already in the market. When did they begin their Internet grocery service and how successful have they been to date?\nInterviewer: They began about 6 months ago and approximately 1% of their sales are from the Internet. However, they are forecasting that number to grow. Of course, we can’t know for sure what will happen.\nCandidate: Have your stores experienced any reduction in traffic over these last 6 months?\nInterviewer: Well, perhaps a very small drop, but it’s hard to say.\nCandidate: Can you tell me about the competitor’s pricing through the Internet; are prices the same or higher than those in the retail stores?\nInterviewer: Actually, prices have been mixed with no noticeable trend. Honestly, I think they are still floundering to see if they can justify a premium.\nCandidate: (I’m getting the hint to move on…) I see, so it seems that we can’t be sure based upon the competitor how successful this project may be, nor can we accurately forecast what the competitor’s strategy going forward will be. Why don’t we move on to consumer demand. The competitor’s sales of 1% via the Internet is small. This could be because the trend is just starting to pick up or consumers are just not interested. I think I would want to conduct a survey of the client’s current customers to assess their level of interest in the Internet grocery service. This is instrumental to determine the market size as well as to assess the threat of cannibalization. Additionally, I would want to survey potential new customers as well.\nInterviewer: That’s interesting…how would you identify these people?\nCandidate: Perhaps we can obtain a listing of residents in proximity to each of our stores and cross reference them to credit cards used, “Price Club” membership, checks received, etc. In this way, we can determine who is not shopping at our stores and find out if they would use the Internet service. I would also use the survey to determine if consumers are willing to pay a premium for items purchased through the Internet to help with the pricing strategy. Based upon the responses, we can determine the potential market size figuring in cannibalization and pricing. Next, I would focus on the costs of running the service.\nInterviewer: Good…what kind of costs do you think the client will incur?\nCandidate: Well, there is the cost of the web server and maintenance of it, delivery and “order processing” personnel, insurance for the delivery people and inventory warehousing costs. My main concern in cost is the inventory. The client needs to assure not only that the retail shelves are stocked, but now also that there is inventory for the delivery service. The problem becomes, where to store the inventory…\nInterviewer: You’re right, that’s a big concern. We were thinking that the client could store inventory at each retail store, use the current warehouse distribution centers or build a warehouse specifically for the Internet service. What are your thoughts on these options?\nCandidate: I think the answer to that depends on the time frame. If the client decides to move forward with the Internet grocery service, initially I think it would be wise to use the existing warehouse distribution centers, provided that they are strategically located so that groceries will reach consumers in a timely fashion and that they have additional capacity available.\nBuilding an additional warehouse is costly: the building itself, new personnel, training costs, etc. Unless there is a sustainable and sizable demand for the service, I don’t think these costs can be justified. The client would be wise to use what they currently have, wait and see what the longer-term demand for the Internet grocery service is (eliminate the “fad” buyers) and then determine if a new warehouse is actually needed.\nI don’t like the idea of using retail stores because inventory storage merely takes away from retail selling space. In addition, retail stores probably don’t have the capacity to store inventory for themselves and the Internet delivery service.\nInterviewer: Hmmm…well, what should the client do?\nCandidate: In sum, the client needs to determine the market potential, cannibalization and the cost of running the service. If there seems to be at least some demand and there is extra capacity in the distribution centers, I think the client should at least try the service for a little while. It won’t be too costly for them and this way, if the trend does begin to pick up, the client is ready for it.\nIf the demand seems low or the client decides to not pursue the opportunity, they do need to be careful about protecting their market share. Perhaps they can do that by emphasizing the shopping experience at a retail store. They can run commercials showing that it is more pleasant to roam the aisles in search of your favorite foods, rather than trying to recall what you like by staring at a computer screen. They can also use the surveys to determine if there is anything about their current retail stores that can be improved to keep the customer in the store, such as music, cleanliness, staff, etc. In this way, the client can meet the consumers needs in the retail store and entice them to stay.\nInterviewer: Well, that’s a great analysis…we actually did this case and took a very similar approach.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: reduce costs.\nConsulting Firm: L.E.K. Consulting first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: agriculture, farming, aquaculture; international trade.\nCase Interview Question #01052: Assume I’m the owner of a very large soybean farm in Argentina, a country located in southeastern South America. Soybeans are a commodity. 70% of all soybeans are used for chicken and pig food. It is a very efficient source of energy. Another use for soybeans is splitting it up into soybean meal and soybean oil. 80% becomes the meal and 20% the oil.\nMany soybeans are grown in South America (31% of world total in Brazil, 18% in Argentina), but demand for the soybean meal and soybean oil is growing very fast in Asia. I am trying to decide if I should process the soybeans into meal and oil in South America and ship them to Asia, or if I should ship soybeans directly to Asia and do the processing there. What factors should I consider? Which of the two options should I choose?\nPossible Answers:\n1. Suggested Framework \nConsider the cost differences between processing in the two places. Major costs would be:\na. Labor\nb. Overhead\nc. Distribution\nd. Transportation\n2. Analysis\na. Labor\n• Both areas have relatively cheap labor and much of the process is automated.\nb. Overhead\n• Similar in the two areas\nc. Distribution\n• Once the product is there, the distribution to the rest of the area would be the same.\nd. Transportation\n• Call a shipper and get a quote.\n- $10/ton to ship whole beans from South America to Asia\n- $20/ton to ship oil to Asia\n- $10/ton to ship meal to Asia\nSince 80% is meal and 20% is oil, the shipping cost would be $8.00 for the meal and $4.00 for the oil, for a total of $12.00 per ton.\nTo know if this matters, you would have to find out what the margin is. If the profit on one ton of soybeans is $10.00, then the $2.00 savings is significant. If the profit is $1,000.00 then the $2.00 is probably not that important of a savings and the intangible or other costs would determine where you would want to process.\n3. Sample Interview Transcript\nInterviewer: What factors should I consider?\nCandidate: Well, you need to look at the cost differences between processing in the two places. I think the major costs would be\n• Labor\n• Overhead\n• Distribution once in Asia\n• Transportation\nWould the labor costs be less in either of the two areas?\nInterviewer: No, both areas have relatively cheap labor and much of the process is automated.\nCandidate: I assume the overhead, i.e. factory, machinery, etc. would also be similar in the two areas?\nInterviewer: Yes.\nCandidate: And would the distribution be different?\nInterviewer: No, once the product is there, the distribution to the rest of the area would be the same.\nCandidate: I must be missing something then, because if the whole soybean is used to make meal and oil, there wouldn’t be any difference in the weight of the two products and no difference in shipping costs.\nInterviewer: How would you verify that?\nCandidate: I would call a shipper and get a quote.\nInterviewer: OK, assume now I am the shipper.\nCandidate: How much will you charge to transport soybeans from South America to Asia?\nInterviewer: $10.00 a ton.\nCandidate: OK, and how much will you charge to transport oil and meal?\nInterviewer: Well, oil travels in a different type of ship because it is liquid, and is $20 a ton. The meal is $10.00 a ton.\nCandidate: Since 80% is meal and 20% is oil, the shipping cost would be $8.00 for the meal and $4.00 for the oil, for a total of $12.00 per ton. This is more expensive then shipping the soybeans, so I would recommend shipping the soybeans and processing them in Asia.\nInterviewer: Is this $2.00 significant?\nCandidate: You mentioned that soybeans are a commodity. Usually in commodities small cost advantages can have dramatic results.\nInterviewer: Maybe, how would you know if the $2.00 is significant?\nCandidate: Well, I would look at other costs, such as quality issues or intangible costs such as pleasing the government, etc. I would compare these other costs to the $2.00/ton.\nInterviewer: OK, but what else is important to consider? Does the profit margin matter?\nCandidate: Yes, I just assumed the margin is small because this is a commodity, but maybe this is not the case. If the profit on one ton of soybeans is $10.00, then the $2.00 savings is significant. If the profit is $1,000.00 then the $2.00 is probably not that important of a savings and the intangible or other costs would determine where you would want to process.\nInterviewer: Good.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

What do you think? Should they enter or not?\nPossible Answer:\nNote: The interviewer intentionally gave a very vague case introduction. The candidate was supposed to ask clarifying questions in the beginning.\nCandidate: First of all, I would like to clarify a few things before I start analyzing the case. Is that OK with you?\nInterviewer: Sure.\nCandidate: Is it an India-based company or a foreign player?\nInterviewer: It is a foreign company which wants to enter India.\nCandidate: I would first like to analyze the current business of the client company and its market entry targets and expectations. Can you tell me the core business of the company?\nInterviewer: I do not want you to go into the details. I want to know the structure that you will follow to analyze the situation.\nCandidate: Sure. Kindly give me a minute.\nInterviewer: Sure.\nCandidate: The structure that I would use to gauge whether the company should enter health insurance market in India is as follows:\n1. Company\nCurrent business\nNew business targets\nExpection\n2. Customers\nCurrent market segment\nMargins\nDistribution system\n3. Competitions\nCompetitors\nNew products\nNew entrants\nInterviewer: The structure is absolutely fine. Now let me tell you that there aren’t too many international companies in the health insurance sector in India. Can you tell me why?\nCandidate: To be honest I do not know much about this industry but let me think about it. In an industry like health insurance, there could be either regulatory issues or profitability issues.\nInterviewer: Yes, I would like you to focus on profitability issues.\nCandidate: Now let’s look at the costs incurred. The different types of costs incurred are claim costs (incurred if claims are raised by policy holders), distribution costs and fixed costs (in operating the firm). Am I right in naming these costs?\nInterviewer: Kindly restrict yourself to claim costs for now.\nCandidate: Claim costs could be of two kinds – Administrative costs and treatment costs.\nInterviewer: Good. Go on.\nCandidate: Admin costs would be high if we have to check on every claim made.\nInterviewer: So how would we counter this?\nCandidate: We can counter this by having an incentive for lesser number of claims made or we can have a minimum claim amount to avoid admin costs of small claim amounts.\nInterviewer: Ok. What about treatment costs?\nCandidate: Treatment costs would be large if a lot of claims are made. Moreover, for genuine claims, treatments costs can be quite high when the illness is severe.\nInterviewer: Good. So can you suggest some ways to reduce these costs?\nCandidate: According to me, we can do three things: Firstly, we can develop benchmarks which would give us an idea about the treatment costs. Secondly, we can give doctors an equity share in the company to incentivize them to bill treatment costs on the company (on behalf of the patient) only to a reasonable extent. Lastly, we can have doctors directly on our payrolls and these would be the doctors who would serve patients in the hospital.\nInterviewer: Fine.

Irving Materials Inc. (IMI) is a concrete manufacturer and building materials supplier operating throughout the midwest and the southern U.S. The company produces and delivers ready mix concrete in Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, southwestern Ohio, southeastern Illinois, and northern Alabama.\nThe client Irving Materials has seen a sharp decline in market share from 40% in the 1990s to 4% now (2015). Also the current gross profit margins are down to -5%, i.e. the company is operating at a loss! The CEO of Irving Materials has hired our consulting firm to investigate. We need to help the firm turnaround their business from this bad situation. What would you suggest they do?\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate: Can I think about the case for a minute before I start?\nInterviewer: Sure. Let me know when you are ready.\nCandidate: Basically, the client is facing losses. Profit = Revenue – Cost. There can be several factors that can contribute to losses such as Change in the market conditions, Customers, Competition etc. which are all fairly standard. Can you explain to me the business and the revenue streams before I proceed to the revenue/cost equation?\nInterviewer: The concrete business involves preparing concrete (using cement, stone, etc.) which is transported from the plant within a 6-hour radius. The company owns the trucks for doing that. The 6-hour criterion is important as the concrete hardens after 6 hours and hence becomes unusable.\nCandidate: Do we have any information on the market scenario and if our volumes and revenues have shown a growth/decline in absolute terms?\nInterviewer: The revenues have gone up by 14% CAGR and sales volumes by 20% CAGR.\nCandidate: So, in that case we can see that the revenues have gone up. The declining profits also mean that our costs have risen more than our revenues and hence I would like to focus my analysis on the costs side.\nInterviewer: Good. What do you think could be the factors that might have caused high costs?\nCandidate: A few factors could be increasing raw material costs, transportation costs or wastage due to not meeting the 6-hour criterion.\nInterviewer: Can you think of any other factors?\nCandidate: If the client’s plants are not running at full capacity, then the largely fixed operating cost of the plants would be distributed over lesser volume increasing the costs per ton.\nInterviewer: Good, anything else?\nCandidate: Well, I’m not very familiar with the concrete industry. Can you give me some hints?\nInterviewer: Actually another reason for the client’s high costs was that the customers are in multiple segments, infrastructure, realty, etc. We are not selling to everyone. Further, our capacity utilizations are lower than competitors although we sell similar amount because of our plants being bigger. Moreover, we faced some quality issues in the past and have increased the amount of cement we put in the concrete which has caused costs to go up significantly.\nCandidate: Thanks for the insight. This is a very interesting case.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Woolworths currently operates about 180 stores across Australia, as well as a further 20 convenience stores carrying the same logo.\nWoolworths Supermarkets has a problem with their chilled foods division. The chilled food division is divided into two parts: “meat, grocery and juices” form the first part and milk forms the second part. For the non-milk chilled foods, there is a centralized warehouse and the products are then delivered to about 200 retail stores across Australia. For milk, the suppliers directly deliver to the stores. What will happen if they switch their distribution system frequency to daily?\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate: Can I take a look at it for a moment?\nInterviewer: Sure.\nCandidate: Okay, so we have a distribution system where the goods are delivered daily either by our warehouse or by other suppliers, right?\nInterviewer: Well, the central warehouse delivers to the stores only once in three days. Milk products are delivered daily from the supplier.\nCandidate: So we are evaluating the option of getting all our goods delivered to the supermarket stores on a daily basis, either by a centralized warehouse or by a group of suppliers, right?\nInterviewer: Yes. Carry on!\nCandidate: Okay, I would first look at the costs involved and then find out the potential benefits for both the options. I would like to know how we are getting the delivery done for milk.\nInterviewer: For milk we use 8 trucks that do the delivery for 200 stores.\nCandidate: Okay. So given that a truck can cater to the demand of 25 stores, we can work out the cost.\nInterviewer: Don’t look into the numbers yet. Let’s just look at the pros and cons of each distribution method.\nCandidate: OK. In case we have a central warehouse and do daily delivery, the inventory carrying cost is higher but we reduce the chances of lost opportunity (that is demand unmet in case of a demand spike due to lack of sufficient stock). This effectively reduces our risks. We will have to order in lower lots and we can also cuts down our administration costs, given lesser number of transactions with the warehouse.\nInterviewer: Good. What else do you think is important given the nature of your goods?\nCandidate: Well, if we remove the warehouse and deliver ourselves then we will have to send our trucks to every store, every day.\nInterviewer: So?\nCandidate: So our chilled goods, fruits and juices will be much fresher at the stores.\nInterviewer: Good. What about the stores?\nCandidate: Stores will carry fewer inventories and hence would need to order more frequently, and respond faster to changing demand patterns.\nInterviewer: That is a neat analysis. Thank you.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The company is a leading manufacturer of pigments. ICI has a wide distribution network for efficient and effective delivery. The company has been serving its clients for the past 50 years.\nThe CEO of ICI has hired a team of management consultants from Oliver Wyman to see if there are any problems with the company. The CEO also would like to hear your recommendations regarding any corrective course of action that could help to resolve the problem (if any) identified. How would you go about it?\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate: May I take a minute or two to go over my thoughts and come up with a structure?\nInterviewer: Sure, go ahead.\nCandidate: We can look at both the internal and external factors affecting the client company ICI. In the external factors, we can look at market growth, market share, product portfolio and substitutes. And on the internal side, we have factors such as the profit margins, price and volumes. Which side would you like me to start first?\nInterviewer: Whatever works for you.\nCandidate: OK. So how many products does the company have?\nInterviewer: They have only one product line which is commodity pigments, hence there are no product mixes and there are no substitutes available.\nCandidate: OK. What is the price of the client’s pigments product? And how does the client’s price compare to competitors’?\nInterviewer: Price of the product grew at 15% per annum. However, it is irrelevant as it is a commodity product and we don’t have control over it.\nCandidate: In that case can I know the market share and the growth of revenues of the company?\nInterviewer: The client has a dominant position with a 55% share in this market and overall the pigments market is growing at 10% per annum in India. The client had 15% gross profit margins, while industry average was only 10%-12%.\nCandidate: I see. Let’s concentrate on the market size growth and the price increase. So essentially if they were to maintain the 55% market share, then their revenues would have grown by 15% increase in price times 10% increase in market size, which is 26.5% ((1.15*1.1) – 1 = 0.265). What is the actual growth in their revenues?\nInterviewer: Revenues grew only 15% per year.\nCandidate: So, the market price has increased by 15% and the overall market size by 10% which should have increased their revenues by 26.5%, but their revenues increased only by 15% actually. This could be because their sales volumes are not growing fast enough. What is the growth in the volume of sales of the company?\nInterviewer: The sales volumes have remained almost constant. What do you think might be the reasons behind this?\nCandidate: One possible reason for constant sales volume could be capacity constraints.\nInterviewer: Yes, in fact the client’s plant is operating at 100% capacity and they are not able to meet the additional market demand.\nCandidate: Then whatever increase in revenues happened, it was because of increase in price.\nInterviewer: Yes, price was an issue here. That will be all. Thank you for your time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

It is one of the three largest tire manufacturers in the world along with Bridgestone and Goodyear. In addition to the Michelin brand, it also owns the BFGoodrich, Kleber, Tigar, Riken, Kormoran and Uniroyal (in North America) tire brands. \nThe client Michelin produces tires in France, Spain, Germany, the USA, the UK, Canada, Brazil, Thailand, Japan, Italy and several other countries, but currently it has no presence in India which has a large population of over 1.2 billion. Can you help them find out the tire market potential in India? If the Indian market looks attractive enough, what do you think their strategy for market entry should be?\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate: Can I have a minute to think about it?\nInterviewer: Sure, give me the structure, how you would go about it. Then we can discuss numbers.\nCandidate: I will estimate the market demand for tire first. Then I will look at external factors in the market such as existing players, distribution channels, value chains, customer segments, regulatory framework, entry barriers, etc. After assessing the external environment, I will look at core competencies of the client company and depending on that, suggest if they should enter as a standalone player, do a joint venture (JV) or through merger and acquisition (M&A).\nInterviewer: Sounds good to me. Let’s suppose that our client manufactures tires for passenger cars only. Can you now estimate the demand for the tires in the Indian market for next 5 years?\nCandidate: The demand is composed of two parts: demand for new tires and demand for replacing old tires.\nInterviewer: That’s correct. Go on please.\nCandidate: India’s population is 1.2 billion. About one third or 33% of this population has an annual income of INR 300,000 or more. Given ease of finance and increasing middle class size, I consider this segment to be the total market potential which comes out to be 400 million people.\nA household has on average 4 members in India. So, the number of households is close to 100 million. Assuming current penetration rate of cars to be 40%, there should be about 40 million cars running on the road. So, the stock of cars is 40 million. Assuming average life span of a car to be 10 years, 4 million new cars would be required every year.\nDemand of tires:\n(1) For new cars: 4 million * 4 = 16 million\n(2) For old cars: Assuming 1 tire is replaced every 2 years = 40 million/2 = 20 million\nSo, total demand for passenger car tires = 20 + 16 = 36 million per year.\nInterviewer: That looks great. Can you also help them figure out what all factors would affect the average life of a tire in India?\nCandidate: Some of the important factors would be condition of the road, driving skills of the driver, etc.\nInterviewer: Sounds great to me, let’s move on to the next round.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new product; industry analysis.\nConsulting Firm: McKinsey & Company first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: healthcare: pharmaceutical, biotech, life sciences.\nCase Interview Question #01040: The client AbbVie Inc. (NYSE: ABBV) is a major pharmaceutical company in the U.S. that discovers, develops, and markets both biopharmaceuticals and small molecule drugs. It originated in 2013 as a spin-off of Chicago, Illinois based Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT). As of December 2015, AbbVie employs in excess of 28,000 globally, and provides products to individuals in more than 170 countries.\nAbbVie currently has two new drugs in research and development (R&D), both of which are prescription treatment-type drugs (as opposed to preventative drugs) for osteoporosis, a disease that affects older women. The development period for new drugs is ten years, but the last three years – which involve extensive testing and clinical trial – consume more than half of the cost. Thus, the client AbbVie wants you to decide whether to test the two drugs, test only one of the drugs, or to abandon the two drugs altogether.\nFirst, however, I’d like to ask you to think through two problems for me. One is, what is the size of the potential market for osteoporosis, and two, how do you think the markets for preventative drugs and treatment drugs differ?\nAdditional Information: \nOsteoporosis is a disease where decreased bone strength increases the risk of a broken bone. It is the most common reason for a broken bone among the elderly. Bones that commonly break include the back bones, the bones of the forearm, and the hip. Until a broken bone occurs there are typically no symptoms. Bones may weaken to such a degree that a break may occur with minor stress or spontaneously. Chronic pain and a decreased ability to carry out normal activities may occur following a broken bone.\nOsteoporosis itself has no symptoms; its main consequence is the increased risk of bone fractures. Osteoporosis becomes more common with age. It is more common in women than men.\nPossible Answers:\nQuestion #1. Estimate the size of the market for osteoporosis drugs\nAssume that we’re only looking at the United States. The population of the U.S. is about 320 million, slightly more than half of which is women. So say there are 160 million women in the U.S. I think osteoporosis begins to be a concern in women over 50, so we need to figure out how many women are over fifty.\nOkay, well, my guess is that about 25% of the population is over 50, so that’s about 40 million potential customers – and we should remember that as the population ages, more people will fall into this category, so potential customers will increase. Naturally, for a treatment drug, we would then need to get the rates of incidence (to find out what percentage of women in the correct age group actually develop osteoporosis) and whether that is trending up or down.\nThe number of people willing to take a preventative drug would depend on several things. The randomness of the disease – I don’t know much about osteoporosis, but if there’s a clear high-risk group, and few others get the disease, then those people are likely to be customers but people outside the group are not. On the other hand, if the disease is really random in whom it strikes, then more people are at risk, but with a lower risk for each person.\nThus, people would make their decisions based on the cost of preventing the disease balanced against the consequences of getting it. So, if there’s a treatment available that minimizes the problems associated with getting the disease, then few people will take the prevention. On the other hand, if the disease is not treatable and has severe consequences, many people will want to take preventative measures. Then, it’ll come down to very pragmatic factors:\n• Is the drug easy to take?\n• Is it a simple pill taken every morning or is it several pills a day with restrictions on diet, etc?\n• Will it be covered by medical insurance?\n• Are there any side effects?\nQuestion #2. Detailed differences between treatment and preventative drugs (in terms of Marketing and Distribution Channel).\n• Patients already suffering from a disease will go to a doctor, so doctors will be the ones making choices among competing drugs.\n• For a preventative drug, however, the patient will likely have more influence, because even if it’s a prescription drug, they may or may not choose to take it, and they may find one drug more convenient than another and thus make a choice (while patients suffering from a disease are likely to put up with inconvenience to make themselves feel better).\n• Doctors will respond most to effectiveness because they will likely be more scientific and have done more of their own research (even if it’s just talking to colleagues) about a drug than patients. So that’s the most important thing to stress.\n• Patients, however, will be less attuned to the science behind the medicine, and will also be very conscious of side effects, convenience, etc.\n• So a treatment drug would be mainly advertised in medical journal publications and similar areas, with a stress on the effectiveness of the medication.\n• A preventative drug, however, would likely be advertised more broadly, targeting the group that might be at risk for the disease, and stressing the awful consequences of getting the disease and how easy and safe it is to take the prevention.\nQuestion #3: Should the client come out with preventative or treatment drugs?\nAt the moment they’re treatment drugs, although they could be preventative drugs in the future. The normal pattern is for new drugs to come out as treatments first, because longer testing is required to prove value as a preventative. So the drug will be released as a treatment and then the company would continue testing to see if it has value as a preventative. But consider the shorter-term possibilities as a treatment drug.\nQuestion #4: Should the client test the two drugs, test one of the drugs, or abandon the two drugs?\nAt this point, an “issue tree” or “probability tree” would be useful to diagram.\nFirst, look at the consequences of the two choices – to test or not to test. For the decision to test, consider the likelihood of success, to find out whether success was likely in general and whether the two drugs had different chances of being successful. (etc. etc. for the whole issue tree).\nOther issues to consider:\n• Are the likelihoods of success different for the two drugs?\n• Should you test one or both?\n• Is the cost of the 2 tests the same?\n• Decision delivery convenience (pill/shot, etc.)\n• Potential market side effects\n• Revenue frequency (how frequent should patients take the treatment)\n• Competition\n• Potential to lose share or position in market\nPriority could be given to finding out about competition:\n• Is the client the first company to develop a treatment for osteoporosis? — No\n• If not, is this treatment significantly different? — No\n• Will the client’s drugs be generic or compete on price? — No\n• Does anything else distinguish the client’s drugs? More effective? Fewer side effects? — No\n• How well have the existing drugs done? — Fairly well\n• This will simply be duplicating the existing drugs to enter the market? — Yes\nIn order to be successful, the client must differentiate the product somehow.\n• Advertising\n• Distribution channel advantages\nQuestion #5: During the course of the project, it was discovered that a small biotech start-up company named “Pharmacyclics” on the West Coast (based in Sunnyvale, California) was developing a new type of treatment for osteoporosis that would essentially make the existing treatment obsolete.\n• The biotech start-up is fairly certain that their new treatment will work.\n• The start-up company must get financing to undertake the expensive last three years of development.\nWhat would be your recommendations to the client?\n1. Cancel testing of the existing two drugs immediately.\n2. Buy the small biotech start-up.\n3. Valuation of the small biotech start-up, how much to pay for it?\nSample Interview Transcript\nInterviewer: First, however, I’d like to ask you to think through two problems for me. One is, what is the size of the potential market for osteoporosis, and two, how do you think the markets for preventative drugs and treatment drugs differ?\nCandidate: Okay, to begin with, let’s estimate the size of the market for osteoporosis drugs. I’ll assume that we’re only looking at the United States for the moment, so the population of the U.S. is about 320 million, slightly more than half of which is women. So say there are 160 million women in the U.S. I think osteoporosis begins to be a concern in women over 50, so we need to figure out how many women are over fifty.\nInterviewer: Just estimate broadly.\nCandidate: Okay, well, my guess is that about 25% of the population is over 50, so that’s about 40 million potential customers – and we should remember that as the population ages, more people will fall into this category, so potential customers will increase. Naturally, for a treatment drug, we would then need to get the rates of incidence (to find out what percentage of women in the correct age group actually develop osteoporosis) and whether that is trending up or down.\nInterviewer: That’s good, and it leads into the next question. How would the size of the market be different with a preventative drug?\nCandidate: Well, the number of people willing to take a preventative drug would depend on several things. First, the randomness of the disease – I don’t know much about osteoporosis, but if there’s a clear high-risk group, and few others get the disease, then those people are likely to be customers but people outside the group are not. On the other hand, if the disease is really random in whom it strikes, then more people are at risk, but with a lower risk for each person. Thus, people would make their decisions based on the cost of preventing the disease balanced against the consequences of getting it. So, if there’s a treatment available that minimizes the problems associated with getting the disease, then few people will take the prevention. On the other hand, if the disease is not treatable and has severe consequences, many people will want to take preventative measures. Then, it’ll come down to very pragmatic factors – is the drug easy to take – I mean, is it a simple pill taken every morning or is it several pills a day with restrictions on diet, etc? Will it be covered by medical insurance? Are there any side effects? If the side effects are severe, they will cancel out the benefits of preventing the disease!\nInterviewer: So tell me what the differences would be in marketing a preventative drug versus a treatment\ndrug, and what factors would affect the sales volumes of each.\nCandidate: (Here I took a minute to sketch down some items in two columns).\nOkay, I’d say the first difference is going to be in whom the target for advertising is. Patients already suffering from a disease will go to a doctor, so doctors will be the ones making choices among competing drugs. For a preventative drug, however, the patient will likely have more influence, because even if it’s a prescription drug, they may or may not choose to take it, and they may find one drug more convenient than another and thus make a choice (while patients suffering a disease are likely to put up with inconvenience to make themselves feel better).\nInterviewer: Okay, how would that change the marketing?\nCandidate: Well, my guess is that doctors will respond most to effectiveness – because they will likely be more scientific and have done more of their own research (even if it’s just talking to colleagues) about a drug than patients. So that’s the most important thing to stress. Patients, however, will be less attuned to the science behind the medicine, and will also be very conscious of side effects, convenience, etc. So a treatment drug would be mainly advertised in medical publications and similar areas, with a stress on the effectiveness of the medication. A preventative drug, however, would likely be advertised more broadly, targeting the group that might be at risk for the disease, and stressing the awful consequences of getting the disease and how easy and safe it is to take the prevention.\nInterviewer: Okay, that’s good. Let’s talk about the client’s problem. Should they spend the money to finish developing the two drugs?\nCandidate: Are they treatment drugs or preventative drugs?\nInterviewer: At the moment they’re treatment drugs, although they could be preventative drugs in the future. The normal pattern is for drugs to come out as treatments, because longer testing is required to prove value as a preventative. So the drug will be released as a treatment and then the company would continue testing to see if it has value as a preventative. But consider the shorter-term possibilities as a treatment drug.\nCandidate: (At this point, I drew the following McKinsey-style “issue tree.” I basically then read it off to the interviewer).\n\nOkay, first I’d look at the consequences of the two choices – to test or not to test. For the decision to test, I’d want to look at the likelihood of success, to find out whether success was likely in general and whether the two drugs had different chances of being successful. (etc., etc., for the whole tree).\nDecision Tree:\n(1) Test (1 or both)\n• Likelihood of Success\n– are the two drugs’ chances different?\n– is success likely?\n• Cost of Test\n– same for both?\n• Potential Market\n– delivery convenience (pill/shot etc).\n– side effects\n– revenue frequency (how sold per treatment)\n– competition\n(2) Don’t Test -> Potential to lose share or position in market\nInterviewer: Okay, those are all important issues. Is there one thing you’d want to find out first?\nCandidate: Yes, I’d want to find out about competition – are we the first company to develop a treatment for osteoporosis? If not, is our treatment significantly different?\nInterviewer: That’s a crucial question. No. In fact, both drugs we’re producing are essentially the same as drugs our competitors already have out on the market.\nCandidate: Are we producing generic drugs that will cost less?\nInterviewer: No, we would not compete on price.\nCandidate: Does anything else distinguish our drugs? More effective? Fewer side effects? Anything?\nInterviewer: No.\nCandidate: How well have the existing drugs done?\nInterviewer: They’ve done very well. They’re the dominant treatments of the disease.\nCandidate: So we’re just going to duplicate their drugs to enter the market?\nInterviewer: Yes. Our drugs will work in essentially the same way as the existing drugs.\nCandidate: Okay, so to be successful, we’d have to differentiate our product somehow, or maybe our size in the market would allow us to gain share just by entering the market – because of purchasing arrangements, brand name, etc.\nInterviewer: No, the competitors are just as big as we are. How would you go about differentiating a product that nearly duplicates an existing product in the market?\nCandidate: Well, one way would be advertising, so that you could potentially make patients ask for our drug over the others. Another way would be on cost, but we don’t want to do that. We might have certain distribution channel advantages – contracts with hospitals, insurance companies, drugstores, etc, to exploit to help.\nInterviewer: Anything else?\nCandidate: Ummmm. (I think he was looking for a specific additional point, but I couldn’t think of anything else. So he let me off the hook).\nInterviewer: Well, that is okay. What would your recommendation be?\nCandidate: It doesn’t seem like it’s worth investing all the money when there doesn’t seem to be a clear way to steal market share from the existing products. On the other hand, a big provider or drugs may not want to be left out of a particular market, for fear of losing other markets to a competitor with a full range of products.\nInterviewer: That makes sense. What if I told you that we found out while doing our research that a small biotech start-up company on the West Coast was developing a new type of treatment that would essentially make the existing treatment obsolete?\nCandidate: What are its chances of being a technical success? And when would it come out?\nInterviewer: We are fairly certain it will work if the firm can get financing to undertake the expensive last three years of development. We even know how the new drug works. They’re about to begin that right now – so it’ll be at least three years until it reaches market.\nCandidate: Then, first of all, I’d probably cancel testing of the existing drugs immediately even the possibility that the drug will become obsolete adds to the problems of the crowded marketplace and makes it a bad investment. If we’re fairly certain that the biotech startup’s drug will succeed, it’s unlikely they won’t be able to find someone to finance the testing.\nInterviewer: What would you tell the client to do?\nCandidate: Well, they could do a few things. If there is a chance that the biotech start-up will get delayed in bringing the new drug to market, we could use what we know to develop it ourselves and beat them to market. But they’ve got a seven-year head-start on us, if our research & development takes the standard ten-year period. We could try to hamper their development somehow – perhaps using our size in the market – but that wouldn’t work for long anyway. They’re a small company?\nInterviewer: Yes.\nCandidate: And the client is a large company with lots of resources?\nInterviewer: Yes.\nCandidate: Well, then maybe they should buy the biotech start-up – that way, the start-up would get its capital, and\nthe client would have a new drug that would trounce the competition in only three years.\nInterviewer: Very good. That’s what we told them, and that’s what they did. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Headquartered in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, CVS Pharmacy is one of the largest pharmacy chains in the United States by number of store locations  (over 9,600 as of 2016) and total prescription revenue.\nCVS stores sell prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, health and wellness products, and photo services. The U.S. retail industry has seen some shift towards being “green” (using recycled materials for packaging) and the client has not yet done that. The client CVS has seen sustained profits for the last several years and is now looking for several growth alternatives in terms of cost reduction and increasing market share. Your consulting firm has been brought in to prioritize the various alternatives and decide the order of execution. As part of the case team working on this project, you have two specific tasks:\n(1) Present a rough time line for execution\n(2) Identify risk and impact of executing these strategies.\nHow would you go about it?\nPossible Answers: \nAs with most 2nd round cases, this is a totally qualitative case. The interviewer should present the strategies to the candidate and should probe the candidate for his / her thought process.\nThere is no right way to solve this case, but organizing the various factors to analyze in a tabular format and then plotting the various growth strategies in a 2 x 2 matrix is the best way.\nIf the candidate does not plan to use a 2 x 2 matrix, encourage him/her to use one after the preliminary analysis.\nAdditional Information: to be provided upon request\nThe interviewer should provide the following strategies to candidate\n• Implement lean manufacturing processes\n• Reorganizing Sales force(Incentives for sales force)\n• Change packaging of products in retail stores( recyclable material)\n• Launch new products in market\n• Change Sales Floor layout\nThe candidate should come up with an issue tree (see Exhibit 1 below) to analyze the various growth strategy options and then create a table with all the 5 growth strategies and the factors that should be considered for evaluation.\nExhibit 1. Sample Issue Tree\n\nSample Issue Tree: Retail Store\n• Market/Industry\n- Market size\n- Growth\n- Competition\n• Company\n- Core competency\n- Vision\n- Financials: Costs, Revenues\n• Growth\n- Short term: Licensing, Pricing\n- Long term: New products, Lean manufacturing\n• Risks\nOnce the candidate has covered most basic attributes for evaluation, ask him / her to rate the various attributes in a rank scale order. A sample evaluation table (Exhibit 2) is provided below for comparison.\nExhibit 2.

A sample 2 x 2 matrix is provided below (Exhibit 3).\nExhibit 3. Sample 2 x 2 Matrix\n\nThe key focus area in the 2 x 2 matrix is the fine balance between risk and impact. This is where the candidate should ask questions about the current state of the market/industry, client company and competition. The interviewer should mention that some green initiatives in the retail industry has been causing some trouble with some packaging for the drugs.\nThe main purpose of this case is to understand the thought process of a candidate when an ambiguous business problem is encountered. The overarching issue with the client company CVS right now is the focus on green initiative by the retail industry, and that is why the impact of the packaging change to recyclable material is a medium impact strategy. A sample order of execution is as follows:\n1. Packaging Change: Start “Go Green” initiative\n2. Sales Floor change: Reorganize the drug products to emphasize new packaging\n3. Sales Force realignment: Focus on the new green brand\n4. Lean Manufacturing: Long term sustainable cost advantage\n5. New Products: Product differentiation\nAdditional Questions for case discussion:\nQuestion #1: What are some of the risks with the execution order strategy?\nQuestion #2: Is this a long term sustainable solution?\nQuestion #3: How can the retail store chain CVS leverage its dominance in the supply chain?\nQuestion #4: What if the competition also copies the green initiative?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: mergers & acquisitions (M&A); pricing & valuation.\nConsulting Firm: Bain & Company first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: tobacco & alcohol.\nCase Interview Question #01041: The client Constellation Brands Inc. (NYSE: STZ), headquartered in Victor, New York, is a large American wine company with brands in wine, beer and spirits. The company was established in 1945 in the Finger Lakes region of New York. Since that time, the company has grown through both internal expansion and by acquisitions across all segments of the beverage alcohol industry. Currently Constellation operates about 40 production facilities in the U.S., and employs more than 4,200 people.\nThe client Constellation is looking to expand their business globally. They have retained our consulting firm to advise them on the valuation of Klein Constantia, a South African wine company that they are looking to acquire. Klein Constantia, based in the suburb of Cape Town, is noted particularly for its production of high-quality white wines. First, why don’t you walk me through some of the things you would consider in advising the client?\nPossible Answers:\nThis is a mergers and acquisitions (M&A) due diligence case, but the key part is the valuation of the acquisition target. There are three broad areas to consider: \n• The client’s strengths & weaknesses both financially and from a business standpoint.\n• Industry growth trends including a competitive assessment in the United States.\n• Acquisition target’s strengths and weaknesses.\nObjective is to:\n• Evaluate the vulnerabilities – need for specialized inputs or labor, power of suppliers and buyers, threat of competitive attack, need for customer service, etc.\n• Evaluate the variabilities – historical sales growth, profit margins and expected growth trends in the wine industry.\nThe next step would be to explain the mechanics of the valuation.\n1. Identify both a realistic worst case EBIT growth.\n2. Identify a target capital structure for the company.\n3. Carry out a pro forma financial statement projection for five or ten years out.\n4. Add back noncash items, changes in CapEx and working capital.\n5. Compute free cash flows.\n6. Compute WACC (weighted average cost of capital).\n7. Determine terminal value (assume stable growth at the end of projection horizon).\n8. Discount the free cash flows.\nIn order to determine the WACC for the acquisition target, you need to first identify the equivalent of the long-term treasury bond here in the U.S. Next, look at the beta for the acquisition target and use a market risk premium of 4% or so to figure out the cost of equity. You should also add a country risk premium for South Africa and a size-based premium based on the market cap of the target.\nFind the country risk premium by identify a bond of identical maturity here in the U.S. and the spread in yields between the two bonds would be the country risk premium for South Africa.\nSample Interview Transcript\nInterviewer: First, why don’t you walk me through some of the things you would consider in advising the client?\nCandidate: I’d like to evaluate three broad areas – (1) the client’s strengths & weaknesses both financially and from a business standpoint, (2) industry growth trends including a competitive assessment in the United States and finally (3) evaluate the acquisition target’s strengths and weaknesses before actually carrying out the valuation.\nMy objective is to evaluate the vulnerabilities – need for specialized inputs or labor, power of suppliers and buyers, threat of competitive attack, need for customer service, etc. – and variabilities – historical sales growth, profit margins and expected growth trends in the industry – that our client faces. This will be critical in undertaking the actual valuation.\nInterviewer: OK, that sounds like a good overview. Why don’t you tell me the various steps that you would take in the valuation?\nCandidate: (At this stage, I felt that the interviewer was probing for the mechanics of a valuation.) Well, once we have undertaken the variability and vulnerability assessment, we can identify both a realistic worst case EBIT growth and a target capital structure for the company and carry out a pro forma financial statement projection, for say, five or ten years out. Then, we add back noncash items, changes in CapEx and working capital and compute free cash flows.\nOnce this is done, we can compute a weighted average cost of capital and discount the free cash and the terminal value, which can be computed with an assumption of stable growth at the end of our projection horizon.\nInterviewer: How would you calculate the WACC for the South African target?\nCandidate: I’d first identify the equivalent of the long-term Treasury bond here in the U.S. We can then look at the beta for the target and using a market risk premium of 4% or so to figure out the cost of equity. I’d probably also add a country risk premium for South Africa and a size-based premium based on the market cap of the target.\nInterviewer: Interesting. How would you figure out the country risk premium?\nCandidate: Ideally, if there is a dollar-denominated bond available in South Africa, I’d identify a bond of identical maturity here in the U.S. and the spread in yields between the two bonds would be the country risk premium for South Africa.\nInterviewer: Somehow, I don’t like using a country risk premium. It seems very arbitrary. I’m not convinced how or why such a premium is applied. But I agree theoreticians tend to recommend using something like this.\nCandidate: At this stage, I was not going to argue with my interviewer. I vaguely agreed with him, but thankfully we were well out of time and he said he’d love to chat with me about this later. I found out through the course of the interview that I was being considered for the Corporate Finance & Strategy practice, though I had not explicitly expressed an interest in this practice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new product; market sizing.\nConsulting Firm: Boston Consulting Group (BCG) first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: chemicals.\nCase Interview Question #01042: The client is the chemical fibers division of industrial chemicals company E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (commonly referred to as DuPont, NYSE: DD). The chemical fibers division of DuPont is in the business of manufacturing man-made fibers and have had annual sales of USD $2 billion.\nRecently, the client is concerned that their sales have been declining steadily over the past five years. Their objective is to identify 3 to 4 new lines of business with total revenues of $600-800 million utilizing existing capacity in the fiber manufacturing facilities. They have come up with a new type of synthetic fiber that has very good absorbency, something like 10 times its weight, which is a breakthrough in the fiber industry. The client is looking to enter the urban pet care market in the U.S. with this new high-absorbency fiber. They want to manufacture pet care sponge pads, sort of like diapers for pets in urban areas.  The client would like us to evaluate the potential of this idea, which is where you come in. How would go about it?\nPossible Answers:\n1. Suggested Framework \n4C’s:\n• Company (value chain)\n• Competitors\n• Customers\n• Cost\n2. Company\n• The client DuPont is an established industrial product manufacturer.\n• Fibers are specifically used in fashion apparel industry and for cigarette filters.\n• The fiber division’s sales are around $2 billion a year.\n• End users don’t know their brand.\n• No marketing in the traditional sense.\n• No advertising experience.\nValue Chain:\n• The client only deals with distributors.\n• Distributors sell products to retailers (50% markup)\n• Retailers handle relationship with end customers (100% markup)\n• The client wants to continue using intermediaries – they’re reluctant to enter new area of retail.\n• Distributors know this and exploit it.\n3. Market Size and Competitions\n(1) What is the market size of urban pet care in the U.S.?\nThe interviewee needs to estimate on their own. Sample estimation:\n“I’d try to get a sense for the size of the urban pet owner market.\n• The U.S. has a population of roughly 300 million people. On average 3 people are in a household, so we have 100 million households in the U.S.\n• Let’s assume that of the 100 million households, 40% or 40 million households are urban households.\n• Of these, let’s assume that 40% of the urban households, i.e., 16 million households, own pets.\n• I’m considering only dogs and cats as relevant pets for the product. Let’s further assume that each of these households has 1.5 pets. This results in about 24 million urban pets that are potential users of the sponge in question.\nI don’t have a good idea how often these sponges would need to be replaced. I know my baby niece goes through 4 to 6 diapers per day. This is probably too high.\n(Interviewer offers replacement of sponge every other day) OK, that would result in 24 million times about 180 sponges a year or 24M * 180 = 4.32 billion sponges annually. Wow, that seems like a pretty big number! With a 20% market share, our client should be able to sell – assuming that there is a customer need for it – about 800 million pads annually.”\n(2) Competitions\n• Competitive products: No major national brand. Local pet stores sell for $0.50 per pad.\n• Demand is small and sales are restricted to local stores.\n• Client’s competitive advantage: the client’s proposed product has a higher absorbency, but that’s it.\n(3) Conclusion\nThe candidate should conclude on potential revenue for our client:\n“At any rate, let me assess the dollar revenue potential that this product is likely to generate. If the product is priced at the current market levels of 50 cents a sponge, the 100% retailer markup means that the distributor receives 25 cents and the 50% distributor markup would leave the client with only a little over 16 cents per sponge. With an ambitious annual sales estimate of 800 million pads, the revenue potential is about $128 million.”\n4. Customers\n• Location\n• Price points\n5. Cost\n• Cost to build capacity\n• Cost to manufacture\n• Cost to launch product\n6. Recommendation\nThoughts to consider for recommendation:\n• The client is looking for 3 to 4 product ideas with $200 million revenue potential each, while we estimate that the pet diapers  will generate only $128 million is revenue.\n• It’s not even clear if there is a customer need for the product.\n• It’s not clear that the client has the execution quotient to bring this product to market.\n“I would recommend the client not to pursue this idea.”\nSample Interview Transcript\nCandidate: I would explore the following areas and in the process hopefully glean insights to whether or not the pet care diaper sounds like an attractive option for our client. First, I’d like to learn more about the client. Then I’d like to understand the market potential, then assess competitive trends and finally focus on the particular product in question and the client’s ability to execute with regard to bringing this product to market.\nInterviewer: Sounds good.\nCandidate: Can you tell me more about the client’s strengths?\nInterviewer: Well, they are an established industrial products manufacturer, their fibers are specifically used in the fashion apparel industry and for the manufacture of cigarette filters. They’ve had sales in the billion-dollar range, so they are reasonably big.\nCandidate: Do we know how strong their brand is in the customer’s mind? How strong are their marketing skills? The reason I ask is to understand whether or not our client is best suited to bring this product to market, if there is demand for it.\nInterviewer: Their brand is pretty well known, but not necessarily directly by the end customer. They have not done any marketing in the traditional sense and have no advertising experience at all.\nCandidate: Oh, I see. If they traditionally have not interacted directly with the customer, how does their value chain look like?\nInterviewer: Good question. They deal largely with distributors, who in turn sell the products to retailers. The retailers handle the relationship with the end customers.\nCandidate: Great. I’d like to modify my original framework slightly and explore this value chain a little further. How powerful are these intermediaries, and would the client want to continue to use them in bringing the pet sponge to market?\nInterviewer: The client prefers to continue using the intermediaries. They are reluctant to try things that they are not necessarily experienced in. The intermediaries know this and consequently the distributors would demand a 50% markup while the retailers would require a 100% markup.\nCandidate: Interesting! Why don’t I move to the next area of my original framework, market potential? Do we have any research on the size of this market?\nInterviewer: Not really but how would you go about sizing the market?\nCandidate: Well, I’d try to get a sense for the size of the urban pet owner market. The U.S. has a population of roughly 300 million people. On average 3 people are in a household, so we have 100 million households in the U.S. Let’s assume that of the 100 million households, 40% or 40 million households are urban households. Of these, let’s assume that 40% of the households, i.e., 16 million households, own pets. I’m considering only dogs and cats as relevant pets for the product. Let’s further assume that each of these households has 1.5 pets. This results in about 24 million urban pets that are potential users of the sponge in question. I don’t have a good idea how often these sponges would need to be replaced. I know my niece goes through 4 to 6 diapers per day. This is probably too high.\nInterviewer: You’re right. Remember these are high absorbency sponges, but its not clear how tolerant pet owners would be to the smell. Let’s assume that they would want to replace the sponge every other day.\nCandidate: OK, that would result in 24 million times about 180 sponges a year or 4.32 billion sponges annually. Wow, that seems like a pretty big number! With a 20% market share, our client should be able to sell – assuming that there is a customer need for it – about 800 million pads annually. Before I figure out the dollar value of this market, let me try to understand if there are any competitive products in the market, how they are priced and if indeed there is a demand for these products.\nInterviewer: Well, there is no major national brand out there. Local pet stores tend to sell such pads for about 50 cents per pad. The demand is quite small and sales are restricted to the local stores.\nCandidate: Is our client’s proposed product any different from these local brands?\nInterviewer: Not really. It has much higher absorbency – but that’s about it.\nCandidate: Hmmm. I wonder how our client hopes to differentiate this product and market it to the customer. At any rate, let me assess the dollar revenue potential that this product is likely to generate. If the product is priced at the current market levels of 50 cents a sponge, the 100% retailer markup means that the distributor receives 25 cents and the 50% distributor markup would leave the client with only a little over 16 cents per sponge. With an ambitious annual sales estimate of 800 million pads, the revenue potential is about $128 million.\nInterviewer: Is this good enough?\nCandidate: Well, you did mention that the client is looking for 3 to 4 product ideas with potential total revenues of $600-800 million, so that’s $200 million revenue each. This pet diaper product idea clearly does not meet this metric. What’s more troubling is that it’s not even clear if there is a customer need for the product and I’m not convinced the client has the execution quotient to bring this product to market.\nInterviewer: Okay. What else would you want to look at before you can make a final go/no go recommendation?\nCandidate: I’d like to evaluate the costs involved with this product launch. One thing to make sure is to ensure the product makes a profit.\nInterviewer: That would be a good thing. Anyway, looks like we are out of time…\nCandidate: Coming out of this interview, I was amazed at how broad the issue was and how many details there were to keep in mind. The interviewer was quite helpful in guiding me along, but it is really easy to get off track. For example, I didn’t quite make the $100 million per idea client requirement till the interviewer asked if my estimate of the revenue potential was good enough. With different assumptions, I could have come up with very different estimates. I guess there is not real right answer, eh?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: finance & economics; operations strategy.\nConsulting Firm: KPMG Advisory first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: healthcare: pharmaceutical, biotech, life sciences.\nCase Interview Question #01043: The client Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) is an American pharmaceutical company headquartered in New York City, with its research headquarters in Groton, Connecticut. It is among the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies. Pfizer develops and produces medicines and vaccines  for a wide range of medical disciplines. Their products include the blockbuster drug Lipitor (atorvastatin), used to lower LDL blood cholesterol; Diflucan (fluconazole), an oral antifungal medication; Zithromax (azithromycin), an antibiotic; Viagra (sildenafil) for erectile dysfunction; and Celebrex/Celebra (celecoxib), an anti-inflammatory drug.\nThe client Pfizer has a market capitalization (market cap) of $200 billion. They have about 4% market share and are currently enjoying a 34 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. The pharmaceutical industry’s average P/E is about 29. Over the next five years they are looking at a healthy growth in their EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margins. However, for three years thereafter (from year 6 to year 8), the EBIT margin growth is likely to stagnate when three of their blockbuster drugs come off patent. Subsequently, blockbusters currently in the pipeline will hit the market and their EBIT margins are expected to return to healthy growth levels. The new CFO of Pfizer wants us to help her figure out if the three-year plateau five years out is an issue she should be worried about. If so, what external options can she pursue to fix it?\nPossible Answers:\n1. Suggested Structure \n• Clarify the client’s position in the industry\n• Explore competitive developments and projected trends\n• Explore some possible external options\n2. Detailed Analysis\n(1) Client Financials:\n• $48 billion in revenues\n• EBIT at $12 billion\n• Gross margins of 80%\n• Totally debt-free\n(2) Client History:\n• Typically taken the OTC approach when blockbuster drugs have come out of a patent\n• Price will drop to 20% of pre-OTC price.\n(3) Competitive Developments:\n• Consolidation is common, but not frequent in the industry.\n(4) External Options:\n• The new CFO has no experience with either mergers or acquisitions, so M&A is out of question.\n• Licensing drugs from other companies\n– This is a fairly common practice in pharmaceutical industry\n– License potential blockbusters that much smaller firms or firms without their clout are currently developing and that will hit the market during the three years in question.\n– Generate sales to grow their EBIT margins.\nSample Interview Transcript\nCandidate: (I had no real idea how to proceed. I didn’t have a particularly good idea about the pharma industry. So there was no particular framework that came to mind. I was going for the “groping in the dark” approach!)\nInteresting. Broadly, I’d like to better understand our client’s position in the industry, then explore competitive developments and projected trends and finally explore some possible external options.\nBut let me first try to get a better sense for our client and their strengths particularly financial. Can you offer some details?\nInterviewer: Sure. Our client Pfizer has about $48 billion in revenues, EBIT runs at about $12 billion. Gross margins are quite high at 80% and they are totally debt-free.\nCandidate: I see. What has the client typically done when blockbuster drugs have come out of patent? I believe over-the-counter (OTC) versions are one route.\nInterviewer: Quite right. They have taken the OTC approach and probably will with these blockbusters as well. But this is not a financially attractive option. As soon as the blockbuster drug goes off patent, its price drops to 20% of its pre-OTC price. Margins are consequently totally squeezed. Anyway, is this EBIT margin plateau an issue?\nCandidate: Oh, I most certainly believe so. You indicated that the client enjoys an above average P/E. So clearly they are doing something right. I’d expect that the market is also aware of this projected trend in EBIT margins and the price of the stock probably reflects an expectation that management will do something about the trend. I would therefore strongly caution against doing nothing.\nInterviewer: So what would you recommend?\nCandidate: You mentioned external options. Can you clarify what that means? Mergers, acquisitions, and so forth?\nInterviewer: Yes.\nCandidate: I see. Can you tell me more about the pharmaceutical industry? Is there any consolidation happening? Are there potential merger or acquisition candidates that the client has in mind?\nInterviewer: Well, consolidation is something that is always happening at different levels. What do you think of a merger of equals?\nCandidate: I’d say this is something we can explore if in fact there are similar trends in the industry and there is a threat of us being left behind or “overpowered”. If not, then there is the anticompetitive aspect to worry about. Also I’d be concerned about post-merger integration issues. Does the client have experience with mergers and managing post-merger issues?\nInterviewer: Let’s assume that they don’t. What types of things would advise the client to look out for?\nCandidate: There are a few things they should absolutely ensure they do. First, they have to make sure that any target will offer operational efficiencies that can be exploited. Then, they have to ensure that they retain and reward management talent appropriately. This talent will be key from an execution perspective and if the client wants to extract all the efficiencies of the merger, retention of management is key. Rewarding management and key officers and tying incentives to performance is therefore critical. Finally, there has to be a very clear vision articulated and tangible, measurable goals established. This is also critical.\nInterviewer: That’s good. What other external options come to mind?\nCandidate: I’m not very familiar with the pharmaceutical industry and I am not sure if there is something unique to this industry. There is nothing in particular that jumps out in my mind.\nInterviewer: Are you familiar with the software industry?\nCandidate: Yes, sort of.\nInterviewer: Are you aware of the notion of licensing?\nCandidate: Oh yes!\nInterviewer: Licensing is something that is fairly common in the pharma industry. The client can take advantage of their marketing prowess and brand image in the market to license potential blockbuster drugs that much smaller firms or firms without their clout are currently developing and that will hit the market during the three years in question. This way they can generate sales to grow their EBIT margins.\nCandidate: Got it.\nLeaving this case interview, I felt as though I had blown the interview for not having come up with the licensing option. In retrospect I probably did a reasonable job. My biggest take-away is that I should have sought clarity on what the interviewer meant by “external options.” He wasn’t particularly forthcoming with information throughout the interview and preferred to let me talk and think out loud. I should have pressed him for a laundry list of what would constitute “external options.” I think it’s perfectly alright to ask such a question and then analyze the relative merits and demerits of each option before making a recommendation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: reduce costs.\nConsulting Firm: KPMG Advisory first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: health & life insurance.\nCase Interview Question #01034: Your client Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts (BCBSMA) is an American regional health plan headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. As a state licensed private health insurance company under the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, the client BCBSMA currently has more than 1.8 million policy holders, with most policyholders insured through employers.\nThe client’s biggest business division provides insurance solutions to the customers. As part of the business model, they collect premiums from the customers and pay part of the medical costs. Within the last 2 years their profits have gone down by 15%. The CEO of BCBSMA has hired your consulting firm to find out the reasons behind declining profits and recommend solutions to stem the problem. How would you go about it?\nPossible Answers:\nThere are not much numbers involved in this case. The case can be approached by using the profitability framework: \nProfits = Revenues – Costs = (Price * Volume) – (Fixed Cost + Variable Cost)\n1. Revenue side\nAdditional Information: Provide the information when requested\na. Company\n• The client BCBSMA is one of the smaller players in the market\n• Charges price premium as compared to closest competitors\n• Differentiates on customer service, easy‐to‐navigate system, more insurance options\n• Operates in the north‐eastern US only, does not have any plans for expanding into other markets\n• The number of customers are growing slowly and steadily but their demographics are changing.\nb. Market & Competition:\n• The overall market for insurance in north‐eastern US is growing at 5% – 6% per year.\n• The competition is average with many players in the market.\n• The competitors are other regional players as well as big national players also.\n• There is no one dominant player in the market.\n• The competition’s products and services are cheaper than our client’s products.\nThe discussion of the revenue side should focus on how the interviewee structures the problem using the information provided above. The interviewee should be able to correctly guess that:\n• There is no scope of playing on prices\n• Since the number of customers is also increasing, the problem is not on the Revenue side.\n2. Cost side\nAsk the interviewee to draw a value chain for the costs in the health insurance industry. The interviewee should cover the following buckets:\nCustomer Acquisition costs -> Customer Support costs -> Pay‐Out costs -> Back office costs\nAdditional Information: Provide the information when requested\na. Costs:\n• Customer acquisition costs are normal and comparable to similar sized competitors.\n• Customer support costs are more, given the company’s focus on customer service. But these costs are expected to be higher and it is difficult to cut corners.\n• Pay‐out costs are mostly standard in the insurance industry.\nb. Back office costs:\n• Ask the interviewee to further break down the back office costs. A good list would be: Back office costs = IT costs + administrative costs + supplies and equipment costs.\n• Ask the interviewee to further break down IT costs. A good break up would be: IT costs = Employee compensation + Software + Hardware.\n• Ask the interviewee about the drivers for the Employee compensation bucket. Two major drivers would be: Salary + Number of employees.\nc. IT costs per IT Employee\nShow the following graph (Exhibit 1) to the interviewee and then ask the following questions:\n• What can you make out from the graph?\n‐- Answer: The client’s IT cost per employee is very low as compared to the competitors.\n• Is that good or bad?\n‐- Answer: It depends. If the number is low because the client has low IT costs then it is great. However, if the number is low because the client has more employees then it might be bad.\nExhibit 1. IT Costs per IT Employee ($ ’000)\n\nd. Total IT Cost\nShow the following graph (Exhibit 2) to the interviewee and ask the following questions:\n• What do you make out from the graph?\n‐- Answer: The client’s total IT costs are comparable to the closest competitors.\n• What does that tell you?\n-‐ Answer: This means that the number of IT employees at our client is very high as compared to the closest competitors.\nExhibit 2. Total IT Costs ($ million)\n\n3. Solutions and Recommendations\nAsk the interviewee the following questions:\n• What do you think can be the reason for such a high number of IT employees at our client company?\nPossible answers include:\n‐- lower efficiency of the employees,\n‐- larger number of current projects,\n‐- lack of cross‐functional synergies (different teams doing similar  work)\n• What can be done to mitigate some of the potential problems that you have listed?\nPossible answers include:\n\n\n\nProblem\nCorrection\n\n\nlower efficiency\nChange incentive structure, better project management.\n\n\nlarger number of current projects\nReview projects and put non‐critical ones on hold to reduce short term costs.\n\n\nlack of cross‐functional synergies\nInstitute/Change “new project” review procedure.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

It is the designated US affiliate of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. The two major services they offer are Disaster Relief and Child Sponsorship.\nAs a large non-governmental organization (NGO), the American Red Cross has operations in more than 100 countries. The ARC has been involved with many international projects, such as the Measles Initiative, malaria programs in Africa, disaster responses worldwide, and relief efforts in response to the 2004 South Asia Tsunami. \nThe ARC leadership feels that the “end results” are not meeting the set objectives. Specifically,\n(1) They are not able to raise enough funds to meet their targets.\n(2) They are not able to utilize the funds they have effectively. \nThey have asked for your help to find ways (1) to raise more funds, and (2) to identify the areas where they can cut some costs. What would you recommend?\nAdditional Information: \nThe disaster relief services are provided locally in the area of a disaster (like Asian Tsunami, earthquakes, etc.)\nThe child support services are where people donate money to support a child in a poor country, in terms of food, lodging, schooling, skills workshops, etc.\nPossible Answers:\nThis is a slightly open ended qualitative case. The interviewee can treat the case as a Profitability or Revenue/Cost problem: the key is finding ways to increase revenue and finding ways to decrease costs.\nFirst, ask the interviewee to come up with potential revenue streams and cost centers for an NGO like The American Red Cross. Let them brain storm on the possible streams and see if they can weave their own experiences into the case.\nProvide the following additional information when required:\na. Revenue streams: The donors are classified as Individual Donors (small players) and Rich Individual + Institutional Donors (big players). Government help can be ignored. The revenue streams can also be broken down by Disaster Relief operations and Child support services. \nb. Cost streams: There are two major cost centers for The American Red Cross: Administration and Training. Administration can be further divided into sub centers as Back Office, Transportation, Recruitment and Advertising.\n1. Explore Revenue Streams\nAdditional Information: to be provided when asked\n• General donations to the ARC go to a pool from where they are divided between Disaster Relief and Child Support, as required.\n• People also make specific donations for Child Support services.\n• Who draws in more donations? Currently, two‐third of the revenue comes in for Child Support activities. Hence, direct the interviewee towards that.\n• Who are the major contributors? Most of the money comes from individual donors.\n• Individual donors are more sensitive to the results on their donations.\nAsk the interviewee for different approaches to reach out to individual and institutional donors.\nThere are no right or wrong answers. Example of possible answers:\nPeople tend to donate more when they can see that their donations are producing results. Hence, develop a system where the donors can be in touch with the child they are supporting. Bring in some ownership and form emotional bond. Use that to advertise and attract more individual donors.\n2. Explore Cost Centers\nAdditional Information: to be provided when asked\n• The interviewee should be able to guess that the Administration activities are the bigger cost center and hence focus on that branch.\n• Within Admin, Back‐office operations form the largest chunk.\n• What are some of the major Back office activities for an NGO like the ARC that you can think of? Answer should include managing communication and managing money being distributed.\n• What are the things you would look at for understanding these activities? Answer should include structured thinking on the lines of People, Processes, and Technology.\n• Each country’s operations have their own spreadsheet‐like software for accounting.\n• There is no common framework within the organization to manage communication.\n• How can you leverage technology to improve accounting and communication. There are no right or wrong answers here.\n• What are the benefits that can be achieved by leveraging technology? Possible answers: Common framework within the organization, reduced duplication of efforts, lesser training costs, more transparency, etc.\nNote: A solid interviewee will try to bring his/her own experiences into the case. Like:\n• In general, where do NGOs get their money from?\n• What are the most common cost centers for NGOs which have world wide operations? \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new business; market sizing.\nConsulting Firm: Ernst & Young Advisory 2nd round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: chemical industry; building materials.\nCase Interview Question #01036: Your client Cooper Tire & Rubber Company (NYSE: CTB) is one of the largest tire manufacturers in the USA. The company specializes in the design, manufacture, marketing and sales of automobile and truck tires. With headquarters in Findlay, Ohio, Cooper Tire has 60 manufacturing, sales, distribution,  technical and design facilities within its worldwide family of subsidiary companies.\nThe current market for tires in the USA is very saturated and with current pressure on car prices the client Cooper Tire is looking for new business opportunity. Their business development team has identified “rubber roofing” as a potential new business to enter. Is this a good idea? What should our client do?\nAdditional Information: to be provided upon request\nRubber roofing is a type of roofing system for buildings and tanks. It is used on flat or nearly flat roofs to prevent leaks and move water off the roof. Rubber roofs are most commonly made from synthetic rubber, or thermoplastic (PVC or  similar material), or modified bitumen. Rubber roofs are usually used in commercial application, though they are becoming increasingly more common in residential buildings.\n• There is a growing demand for rubber roofing in the US.\n• The client Cooper Tire & Rubber Company currently has revenues of over $3 billion.\n• The client has limited capacity for rubber roofing in the current setup. It is estimated that they will be able to gain $5 million in revenue from rubber roofing in the first year.\n• There is a major competitor in the rubber roofing market with a much larger capacity and economies of scale.\n• The competitor can make the roofing cheaper and has more capacity.\nPossible Answers:\nThis is a good case on how to weigh pros and cons of launching a new business. The critical point is to find out who the customers are in the construction and building material industry. The next point is to find out how this new rubber roofing is better than the existing roofing, the rubber roofing is cheaper to install and lasts longer. Its thickness is made to have the same effect as the existing gravel roofing.\n1. Suggested Framework\n• Customers (who are they, what drives them)\n• Product (how is it better than the alternative)\n• Competitors (competitive advantages/disadvantages)\n• Company (capacity and investment)\nThe key is that the 3C’s will not help unless you manage to incorporate the product in great depth. Remember that this is a second round case. Just getting the info is not good enough, you need to build on the info and say what it means to the client.\nNo particular value chain of rubber roofing is required but when comparing the benefits of the rubber to the gravel alternatives the candidate should look at a process.\n2. Quantitative Analysis\nAdditional Information: to be provided upon request\n• The current roofing is made from gravel.\n• Gravel roofing costs $20 per 100 square feet and has a layer of 6 inches.\n• The time gravel roofing lasts is 4 years.\n• The rubber roofing costs $30 per 100 square feet and has a layer of 4 inches and lasts for 10 years.\n• Key info: The time taken to apply the gravel roofing is 30 min per square foot, while the time taken to apply the rubber roofing is only 10 min. (Only provide if the candidate asks, There is a bonus if the candidate can guess “time to apply” will be a factor.)\nCost of gravel roofing = $20 per 100 square feet / 4 years = $0.05 per square foot per year\nCost of rubber roofing = $30 per 100 square feet / 10 years = $0.03 per square foot per year\nThe math in this case is simple, it compares the total cost of ownership (use that phrase a lot) of the rubber roofing to the gravel alternative.\nMath can also be used to determine the total market size (which you should do!) and then conclude that the client company can only serve a small portion of this market with their existing capacity.\nRubber Roofing Market Sizing:\na. Existing homes\n• Population of USA = 300 million\n• Average household size = 3 people, thus 100 million households\n• Gravel roofing lasts 4 years. Thus, every year 25 million houses will be re-roofed.\n• Assume that 10% of them will switch from gravel roofing to rubber roofing, 25M * 10% = 2.5M\nb. New homes\n• Assume the number of new homes built in US = 1 million/year\n• Assume 50% of new homes will be rubber roofed, 1M * 50% = 0.5M\nc. Total # of homes\n• Total number of houses that need rubber roof = 2.5M + 0.5M = 3M\nd. Market size\n• Assume the average home size in US = 2,000 square feet\n• Total market size (sq ft) = 2,000 square feet * 3M = 6 billion square feet\n• Total market size ($) = 6 billion sq ft * $0.03/sq ft = $180M\ne. Client’s market share\n• $5M / $180M = ~2.8%\nConclusion: The client will be able to capture only less than 3% of the rubber roofing market in the first year.\nNote: The candidate should know that many houses will not switch from gravel roof to rubber roof because apartment buildings have only one roof for many houses, etc.\n3. Recommendation\nQuestion #1 – So, what should our client do?\nPoor Response – Wait and watch\nGood Response – Just make the small amount\nExcellent Response – try and capture more of the market.\nQuestion #2 – should we invest in more capacity?\nPoor Response – no, this is not our core business\nGood Response – no, we cannot compete with other major competitors\nExcellent Response – maybe if we can leverage our expertise in rubber.\nQuestion #3 – Where do you see the rubber roofing industry in the future?\nPoor Response – Can’t say much, need more data\nGood Response – Will definitely grow\nExcellent Response – not only will new houses be rubber roofed, the existing homes may switch over, so it has tremendous potential.\nNote that this question #3 may come somewhere in the middle of the case, not necessarily the end!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: growth; pricing; industry analysis.\nConsulting Firm:  Simon Kucher & Partners (SKP)  2nd round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: restaurant & food service.\nCase Interview Question #01037: Your client Domino’s Pizza (NYSE: DPZ) is the second largest pizza companies in the United States (after Pizza Hut) and the largest worldwide. As of September 2015, Domino’s has more than 11,000 corporate and franchised stores in 73 countries. The company is headquartered at the  Domino Farms Office Park in Ann Arbor Charter Township, Michigan.\nThe city of Ann Arbor’s population has grown from 113,000 in 2010 to 117,000 in 2015. The management of Domino’s have seen Ann Arbor’s population change over the years and want to know how best to market their pizza products to maximize profits. What should your client do? Also, they need your help to identify where they can open new stores. What would you recommend?\nPossible Answers:\n1. Case Overview \nThis is a good case on how to look at market entry and growth strategy. The critical point is to find out what the business model is and what the pricing strategy is. The next key point is to find out how the relationship between the client (Domino’s) and the franchisers works. There is some math on how many new shops to open. There is also some strategy on what customers consume pizza.\nThe tricky part of the case is price elasticity of demand and revenues/profits calculations. With lower prices in one single store, there will be more revenue to the franchise but they may face the risk of cannibalization. With higher prices, the franchisee will get more profits but less in revenues: it will hurt Domino’s revenue.\n2. Suggested Framework\n• Customers (who are they, what drives them).\n• Product (how is it better than the alternative), home delivery\n• Competitors (what are the competitive advantages/disadvantages),\n• Company (this is the key of the case, you need to get that it is a “franchise” model)\nNow this an area where the value chain becomes critical. Identifying the “franchise” model and then the turnkey approach.\n3. Quantitative Analysis\nAdditional Information: to be provided upon request\n• Price elasticity = 1.5 (or -1.5 to be precise)\n• 10% increase in pizza price will reduce sales volume by 15%.\n• 10% decrease in pizza price will increase sales volume by 15%.\n• Assume all fixed cost in the franchise remain unchanged.\n• Assume all variable costs are in proportion to quantity.\nThe math in this case is tricky but that is not the key. The interviewer will ask you if the price is elastic or not. This is a red herring.\nThe interviewer will then give you price elasticity of demand (say X% price discount means Y% increase in sales). Then you will calculate that the pricing should be higher for a single store to make more profits.\nCalculations:\nIf revenues were $10 * 100 units = $1,000, current revenue before prices change = $1,000\na. Reduce price by 10%: The new revenues = $9 * 115 units = $1,035. This is a 3.5% increase in revenue.\nb. Increase price by 10%: The new revenues = $11 * 85 units = $935. This is a 6.5% decrease in revenue.\nBecause Fixed Costs remain unchanged, we could calculate profits based on variable costs only.\nAssume variable costs = $6 per pizza. Then, Profits before prices change = $4 * 100 units = $400\na. Reduce price: The new profits = $3 * 115 units = $345. This ia a 14% decrease in profit.\nb. Increase price: The new profits = $5 * 85 units = $425. This is a 6% increase in profit.\nBut here is the problem. Increased price means less revenue for the store, thus less profit for Domino’s. And if a single store chooses to cut price, then there is the risk of cannibalization between stores: maybe other franchises cannot expand (capacity) without adding fixed costs. Even if a franchise store can go with lower price, they shouldn’t!\nThe key is understanding that what is good for the franchise store (owner operator) is not necessarily good for the client (Domino’s). Remember that this is a second round case. Just getting the numbers is not good enough, you need to build on the info and say what it means to the client Domino’s.\n4. Recommendations\nQuestion #1 – Where should they open stores?\nPoor Response – Wherever they want as it’s a franchise models.\nGood Response – they should analyze the customer segments, college students medium income, etc.\nExcellent Response – they should franchise 80% and keep 20% of the corporate stores in the high rent areas. The franchisees cannot afford the high rent in downtown areas but our client Domino’s will have a good brand image.\nQuestion #2 – Should franchises be allowed to increase or lower price?\nPoor Response – yes, they make more profit.\nGood Response – no, we should have standardization.\nExcellent Response – not in the short run, but we should investigate why they want to increase or lower price and if it makes sense, share the best practices with other stores.\nQuestion #3 – Where do you see the pizza industry in the future?\nPoor Response – Can’t say much, need more data.\nGood Response – Healthy food is growing.\nExcellent Response – the entire industry for pizza can change to lower rent. Move from sit‐in restaurants to more home delivery and packed food in the office style. We should understand how we can incentivize franchise owners.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: reduce costs.\nConsulting Firm: A.T. Kearney first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: food & beverages.\nCase Interview Question #01038: Your client Quaker Oats Company is an American baked snack goods manufacturer (i.e. cookies, crackers, snack bars, rice chips, etc) based in Chicago, Illinois, United States. It operates using a direct store delivery model. They operate and own their own trucks driven by company employees. When delivering, they deliver directly to the supermarket and grocery store floor where company employees park at the loading dock, unload goods, and place it on the store shelves. For the most part, employees at supermarkets do not touch the goods at all. This model is industry standard.\nYour client Quaker Oats Company has recently done a cost benchmarking analysis against several competitors and has discovered that their distribution costs are significantly higher than competitors. What is going on? What can be done to reduce their distribution costs?\nAdditional Information: to be provided upon request\n1. There are two key cost areas within the distribution costs.\na. Warehousing Costs\n• Fixed Costs: Land, Maintenance, Overhead\n• Variable Costs: Inventory Holding Costs, Labor\nb. Trucking Costs\n• Fixed Costs: Trucks, Maintenance, Overhead\n• Variable Costs: Fuel, Labor\n2. The client company has 50 trucks. Truck driver utilization is approximately 70%, which is lower than the average in the industry.\n• The client’s direct labor wages paid are the same as the competition.\n• Truck drivers have 10 hour shifts.\n• Direct Labor Costs on the trucking side are higher than industry average.\n3. Supermarkets and grocery stores have a four-hour delivery window requirement for the client. The delivery window requirements are normally distributed with most of the customers requiring that deliveries be made in the hours between 8:00AM and 1:00PM. \nPossible Answers:\nSince the client is concerned with their distribution costs, the candidate should first identify major cost buckets within  distribution costs: — (a) Warehousing and (b) Trucking Costs.\nOnce it is revealed that the client’s Direct Labor Costs on the trucking side are higher than industry average, the candidate should further analyze root causes of the problem.\nQuestion #1: Why are the direct labor costs on the trucking side higher than average?\nThe client’s direct labor costs are higher than industry average for two potential reasons:\n(1) The wages being paid by the client are higher than the market wage, and / or\n(2) The client has more employees than is necessary, i.e. they are not utilizing the available labor hours properly.\nQuestion #2: Why is the client’s utilization lower than the industry average?\nUtilization is lower than average for three potential reasons:\n(1) Demand for the client’s snack goods is not predictable.\n(2) The process for loading the trucks is not efficient, i.e. truck drivers are waiting for the trucks to get loaded, etc.\n(3) Supermarkets have a 4 hour delivery window. Outside of this window, the truck driver’s time is not used efficiently, and thus, both the drivers and trucks are idle. \nQuestion #3: What should our client do?\nExcellent Response:\nThere are internal and external methods for addressing this issue.\n(1) Internally, the client can begin hiring part time drivers to manage the delivery of goods to supermarkets. These part time drivers can be hired to specifically work during the delivery windows. This can help with the client’s direct labor costs.\nThe client, however, should be cognizant of the risks of doing this. Hiring part time drivers can potentially compromise quality of delivery and potentially drive up employee management costs.\n(2) Externally the client can attempt to negotiate with the supermarkets and grocery stores to try to flatten out delivery window requirements such that the client’s labor/equipment resources can be used more efficiently.\nAnother alternative to easing the pain is to attempt to sell the idle truck driver time to other business. An example of this would be to sell to media company that would like to distribute newspapers since delivery time for this type of business would not fall within the 8AM – 1PM segment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "url": "http://www.consultingcase101.com/family-run-hotel-to-offer-mini-bars-in-guest-rooms/",
        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new business.\nConsulting Firm: Gallup Consulting first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: tourism, hospitality, lodging.\nCase Interview Question #00999: Our client is a businessman who owns a family-run hotel. He is considering providing mini-bars in the hotel rooms. Previous his hotel did not have mini-bars installed in the guest rooms. A mini-bar or mini-fridge-bar is a small refrigerator placed in each hotel room that provides both hard and soft drinks and snack. The mini-bar is commonly stocked with small bottles of alcoholic beverages, juice, and soft drinks. It may also include candy, cookies, crackers, and other small snacks. The room’s guests can take a beverage or snack at any time during their stay.\nShould the client provide mini-bars in his hotel rooms? Why or why not?\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate: Before going any further could you please tell me the location of our hotel?\nInterviewer: Assume that it is located in London, UK with a constant inflow of customers.\nCandidate: I would like to analyse the case by looking at the revenue and cost drivers of such a business. I will start with the revenue side. The main revenue drivers are going to be the number of customers who would be willing to utilize this service and the premium they are willing to pay for it. Will you like me to estimate the number of potential customers?\nInterviewer: Sure. Go ahead. Ask us for any data you might need.\nCandidate: Thanks. Could you please tell me the number of rooms available in the hotel and the occupancy rate on an average? Also, does the hotel face any major seasonality?\nInterviewer: Assume the hotel has around 200 rooms with 75% occupancy. There is seasonality but we can keep it out of our discussion.\nCandidate: That gives us a total of 200 * 75% = 150 targets on average. I would like to know about the customers now. I imagine if the customers are families they will not be interested in ordering liquor. However, professionals will be more interested in having beverages.\nInterviewer: Most of the customers are business people. You can take them to be 75% of the total.\nCandidate: The next thing to analyse should be how many customers will prefer a mini-bar over either ordering liquor or going to the bar. The primary advantage of mini-bar is that customers need not wait for drinks to be served. I believe if customers have come in a group, they will not prefer mini-bar as compared to going to the bar. That being said, a lot depends on the kind of products that are being offered in the mini-bar.\nInterviewer: That’s reasonable. Okay, Let us keep the number of potential customers per day to 100. How will you find out what should be the appropriate product mix to be offered?\nCandidate: The hotel should have the logs of which beverages are usually ordered together through past bills. If the hotel goes for advance booking, the product mix can be decided or asked at the time of booking.\nInterviewer: Do you think there is any other source of earning revenues while offering a mini-bar?\nCandidate: Yes. Drinks are never had alone. Customers will usually order some snacks like peanuts, wafers, etc. when they order drinks. Such stuff need to be offered along with drinks otherwise the whole purpose of not waiting for your drink will not be served. In addition to this, the hotel might be able to sell these snacks to customers who otherwise are non-drinkers.\nInterviewer: Let us look at the costs of the added service. In the interest of time, I do not want you to consider costs of machinery like refrigerator. I am interested in knowing any cost which might be very significant for the hotel.\nCandidate: Significant efforts need to be put in monitoring the product mix in the mini-bars in all the occupied rooms. The beverages that have been consumed need to be kept again in the refrigerators and the right product mix needs to be offered at all times. People need to be employed to keep track of items that have been consumed for billing purposes and making sure that the mini-bars are always full.\nInterviewer: One last question I want to ask you. If I say that after all the analysis (Revenue – Cost), the marginal revenue of the mini-bars comes out to be $20,000 per month, does that mean the hotel’s total revenue will go up by $20,000?\nCandidate: Definitely not. This is actually a typical case of cannibalization. The extra revenue that hotel earns is at the expense of the existing bar/room service that was offered. This needs to be subtracted from the expected revenue to make a better judgement.\nInterviewer: That’s right. That will be all. Thank you.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Your consulting team has been brought in to investigate the cause of the problem. Also, the CEO wants you to provide suggestions to improve his business. How would you go about it?\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate: First of all, I would like to understand the question better. By “burning cash” you mean to say that the store is incurring losses.\nInterviewer: Yes, that’s right. \nCandidate: Before I analyse the reasons for this loss, I would like to understand the business better. What kind of retailing are they into?\nInterviewer: They are in apparel retailing.\nCandidate: I would like to know the region of operation of these stores and the number of stores that they have.\nInterviewer: So they have 12 stores across India. Out of these 2 are profitable and 10 others are in loss.\nCandidate: As I understand the market conditions in different parts of India would be different and hence it would take different analyses for them. I would have to group the stores region wise and understand what causes them to be in profit or loss.\nInterviewer: Sounds good. Let us concentrate on the Bombay city region.\nCandidate: Within the Bombay region I would like to know the number of stores and the kind of segment they are targeting. Also I would like to know the kind of competition we have.\nInterviewer: So, they have 1 store in Bombay which is situated in a suburban mall. We are a value for money store. There are 2 similar stores in the mall which target the same segment.\nCandidate: The decline of profit may depend on external or internal factors. If the profit of all the stores in the region is dropping then it may be due to a drop in demand or some regulatory issues. Internal issues will consider the operation side of the business.\nInterviewer: There have been no external factors as you say. In fact the business of the competitors has been growing steadily.\nCandidate: In order to understand the loss I would like to consider the revenue and costs aspects of the business. So, have the revenues of our business dropping?\nInterviewer: Yes they have. Can you explore the reasons?\nCandidate: I would like to understand the revenue streams of the business first. The principal revenue earner would be the sale of clothes.\nInterviewer: So can you think what would the revenue from clothes sale depend on?\nCandidate: The sale would depend on the following factors:\n1. Number of customers entering the store.\n2. The no. of customers entering actually buying the clothes.\n3. The Pricing of the clothes.\nInterviewer: That is correct. The number of customers entering is known as Footfall, and the no. of persons buying is known as conversion ratio. What would you like to do next?\nCandidate: Before I analyse the sales revenue, I would like to know if there are any other revenue streams. Do they have a food joint/ancillary business?\nInterviewer: They have a Computer Controlled Display (CCD) running on the premises. Can you think of any other revenue stream?\nCandidate: …(thinks)…Not really.\nInterviewer: There is also another revenue stream from the advertisements that the brands put up within the store.\nCandidate: I think the revenue from advertisements should be more or less fixed. How is the revenue from the CCD obtained?\nInterviewer: The CCD pays a fixed lease amount to the store. There is also a variable component which is determined by the sales.\nCandidate: So, the CCD revenue would depend on the no. of customers entering the store. The conversion ratio for the clothes would depend on the service level and the quality of the clothes that I have. Are the two dropping?\nInterviewer: Yes.\nCandidate: About the price, has the price of our clothes remained constant?\nInterviewer: Well, the average price of our clothes has remained constant.\nCandidate: So, I can rule out price deviations.\nInterviewer: Before you rule out price can you think of some ways about how average price has remained constant but would still give you some ideas about the segmentation and the nature of demand?\nCandidate: The clothes will be segmented into the high price and low price segments.\nInterviewer: Yes, so what has been observed is that the sale of the high price clothes has dropped but the sale of the low price clothes has remained more or less same.\nCandidate: So, the number of customers in my store has dropped. The conversion ratio has also dropped and the customers are not buying the high price clothes from my store.\nInterviewer: That is correct.\nCandidate: I think that this has something to do with the service quality of my store and the quality of the clothes that I am having. If they are poor that would explain the low conversion rate and also the incidence of low high price sales in my store. The perception of the customers would be low and hence the low footfall.\nInterviewer: Well, the CEO does not agree. He has personally been to the competitor’s store and says that our service levels are better and the quality is comparable to them. It has to be something else.\nCandidate: If that is the case, it means that customers are not coming to my store and who are coming are of a lower income segment. What exactly is my location in the mall?\nInterviewer: Good question. Actually my store is situated in a very obscure location in the mall right next to the bathroom.\nCandidate: That explains a lot. People would not want to come there often.\nInterviewer: So what do you propose to do?\nCandidate: I could install things which attract people like a kids corner or an ice cream store. I would also like to hide my store’s connectivity with the bathroom as much as possible through banners etc. I could also make the high price clothes more prominent inside the store.\nInterviewer: Sounds good.\nCandidate: I think I should move on to the costs side now.\nInterviewer: Go ahead.\nCandidate: The costs can be divided into fixed and variable costs. The fixed costs components would include the rent of the store if it is not owned, maintenance, lighting, etc. The variable costs would include the procurement cost of clothes and the salaries of the employees.\nInterviewer: Sounds good. The store is rented. The cost of leasing is fixed. Can you think of something to reduce that?\nCandidate: We can go for the arrangement like the CCD with a variable component of the sales.\nInterviewer: Ok.\nCandidate: I can make the salaries of the employees also variable and link them to the sales generated. That would spur sales. Also are the cloth procurement costs stable and comparable to competition?\nInterviewer: Yes they are similar. Can you think of something else that could affect this cost?\nCandidate: There might be damages related to the clothes. The clothes that are on display get damaged generally. Is there a cost related to them?\nInterviewer: Yes, we do have to sell such clothes at a 20% discount.\nCandidate: We can ensure that such clothes are sold off quickly.\nInterviewer: Well that’s fine. I think we have had a nice conversation. Also there was problem of pilferage related to the store. The employees were stealing the clothes. However, I think we have covered the major points of the case. Thank you and all the best.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Based in Jamestown, New York, the company is one of the leading ready-to-assemble office furniture companies in the U.S., with sales of around USD $600 Million a year.\nRecently, in order to diversify their business and potentially increase their profits, the client Bush Industries wants to enter the home furniture space. You have been hired to decide whether to enter the segment or not. How would you go about doing this? What recommendation would you give to the client?\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate: Before I start the analysis, can you tell me a little about the client company – specifically,  what kind of office furniture it sells, who are their major customers?\nInterviewer: Sure, the company caters majorly to the big offices where a lot of standard furniture is used. Their furniture products include office desks, chairs, sofas, couches, reception furniture, bookcases and file cabinets.\nCandidate: Does it customize the furniture or does it have fixed designs?\nInterviewer: There is only a small degree of customization, most designs are from a short list of options.\nCandidate: Now coming to the problem, apart from a potential business opportunity and higher profits, are there any other objectives for entering the home furniture segment? Is the existing office furniture segment saturating or not profitable?\nInterviewer: Quite the contrary – the office furnishing segment has been growing at a very good rate, and margins are also generally high for office furnishing. You can assume that they just want to explore this new opportunity.\nCandidate: Ok, I will go about with the analysis in the following way (draws chart):\n1. the home furnishing industry:\na. Market size, growth, margins\nb. Competition, etc.\nc. Demand-supply gap\n2. the client comapny:\na. Ability to invest in the new business (cash position, current position of the company etc.)\nb. Availability of labor and other supply side constraints\nInterviewer: This looks good to me. So let me quickly give you some additional information:\nThe home furniture market is growing, but slower than the office furnishing space. Its margins are also typically lesser and are shrinking because of many mass-producers and high labor costs. There is always a demand-supply gap when it comes to customized furniture in your home, but we have no estimates of whether existing retail supply is enough to account for the demand.\nThe client company is also in good shape to make any investment in such a project, provided, that it is profitable in the long run.\nCandidate: So, I would like to analyse the client’s ability to enter this new business a bit more. The major differences between home and office furnishing are:\n1. Scale & degree of customization\n2. Distribution\nInterviewer: Excellent points. So why don’t we anlayse them one by one?\nCandidate: Office furnishing usually happens in large volumes, and as you mentioned there would be very little customization involved. However, in case of home furnishing, customization is typically higher and more importantly, a wide variety of designs and styles are required. In addition, volume of each design sold will be low and unpredictable.\nInterviewer: That is correct, and that is another reason why operating margins are not as high as compared to office furnishing. Go on.\nCandidate: In terms of distribution, I will assume, the client won’t go for custom-made furniture at households. So it will need either its owned outlets, or contracts with existing outlets. In case of the former, real estate costs will eat up into the company’s profits and in case of the latter, margins will reduce even further.\nIn addition, they will have to design an entire distribution system from production to the retail outlet. This can be a costly affair too.\nInterviewer: Absolutely, in fact estimates state that if the company gets into the office furniture business, it will suffer a loss in this division for at least the first few years.\nAlso, on the point you mentioned about labor – the existing availability of labor in itself is scarce and securing more skilled labor and training them for this purpose will not be easy. It will take considerable time and investment.\nSo, we are running out of time soon. With these facts in hand, what decision do you make?\nCandidate: Considering the margins, the condition of the industry and our lack of experience in this segment, coupled with the labor sourcing problems, I am tempted to decline this opportunity.\nHowever, the client company is looking at the segment for the long term, and if it is able to solve the issues mentioned above and use its brand name to settle into the market after 4 or 5 years of loss, I would still recommend them to go ahead and explore the new opportunity.\nInterviewer: OK, thank you. The client did in fact enter the segment and they are doing really well after 6 years. That would be all.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new business.\nConsulting Firm: Capgemini Consulting first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: engineering, construction; government, public sector.\nCase Interview Question #01002: The client Colas Group is a major global civil engineering firm specialising in road construction and rail track construction through its Colas Rail subsidiary. The Colas Group is active in the construction and maintenance of road, air, rail and maritime transport infrastructure, urban development projects and recreational facilities. With more than 70,000 employees spanning 5 continents around the world, the Colas Group carries out over 100,000 projects each year.\nRecently, The client Colas Group has entered into a public-private partnership (PPP) with the Houston municipal government to build a metro system in the city of Houston under the build-operate-transfer method. A public–private partnership is a government service or private business venture that is funded and operated through a partnership of government and one or more private sector companies.\nIn order to make the Houston metro system project financially attractive, the Houston municipal government has also given the client Colas Group some land around the metro stations in the city, to use as it sees fit. Could you explore how the company could generate revenues?\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate: I’d like to clarify that the client company has already been allotted the land, and there are no issues pertaining to land acquisition or restrictions on use.\nInterviewer: The land has already been handed over. There are no restrictions apart from what would usually apply to any building or development.\nCandidate: Very well. As I see it, the company has three main options: sell the land, rent out the land for someone else to develop, or develop the land itself. Selling the land would involve the least amount of uncertainty and require the least expertise, but would also likely leave money on the table.\nDeveloping it would likely bring in the most money, since we would be involved throughout the value chain, but also requires the greatest investment of time, resources, managerial bandwidth.\nRenting it out would lie somewhere in between the two options, but would entail finding trustworthy partners.\nInterviewer: OK. Suppose the client wants to develop the land. What avenues for development would you explore?\nCandidate: I think there are two main categories: residential and commercial.\nInterviewer: What are you including under commercial?\nCandidate: I would include office buildings as well as commercial complexes like shops, malls, etc.\nInterviewer: OK, why don’t you treat the two (viz. office buildings and commercial complexes) separately, since they have different characteristics. Which of these i.e. residential, office and commercial would you look to develop?\nCandidate: I would not like to create a residential complex. Metro stations are often close to crowded and busy areas. In addition to disturbance caused by the movement of people and traffic, the noise from the trains would also be a turnoff to people looking to buy or rent a home. Does that seem reasonable?\nInterviewer: Fair enough.\nCandidate: For similar reasons, I would prefer a commercial complex over an office building, because few people would like to work so close to a busy, noisy area. However, if the location is central or prestigious, then that might be a mitigating factor. Thus, while I am leaning towards a commercial complex, I feel that we would need to go into additional depth to take a final call.\nInterviewer: OK. Suppose you have decided to build a commercial complex – something like a mall or shopping plaza, with shops, restaurants, etc. How would you increase footfall (the number of visitors to a shop or tourist attraction)?\nCandidate: Should I restrict my answer to only increasing footfalls, or also look into increasing the conversion rate of footfalls into sales?\nInterviewer: Focus on the footfalls for now.\nCandidate: Very well. I would look into the type of customers that would frequent the metro station and examine their likely needs. For example, many of the metro users would be commuting office-goers.\nSo we could sell things that commuters would want, such as newspapers, coffee, food items that can be eaten quickly and/or carried, and so forth. Similarly, since people who have been travelling often feel tired, hungry and thirsty, we could also have a higher proportion of juice bars, coffee shops and restaurants. Since high end customers are unlikely to use public transports, and would avoid crowded places, we could cut down on the number of stores that sell high end brands.\nInterviewer: OK, that’s fine. What you just said are all “pull” ideas, which start from the customer and work backward. Can you think of any “push” idea?\nCandidate: We could alter the physical layout of the complex to route customers to shops. For example, if we design the metro station and commercial complex in a way that one has to walk past several shops in order to go from one platform to another, or from the platform to the street, then people might be tempted to make impulse purchases.\nInterviewer: Good. In fact, this technique is quite prevalent, and is used most noticeably in airports. I think that will be all. Thanks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: investment.\nConsulting Firm: NERA Economic Consulting first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: engineering, construction; government, public sector.\nCase Interview Question #01003: The client Turner Construction Company is a North America-based, international construction services company and is a leading builder in highway. The company has earned recognition for undertaking large, complex projects, fostering innovation, embracing emerging technologies, and making a difference for their clients, employees and community. With a staff of more than 5,200 worldwide employees, the company completes $10 billion of construction on 1,500 projects each year.\nThe client Turner is currently evaluating the prospect of taking up an upcoming public-private-partnership (PPP) project. The project is for the construction of a stretch of interstate highway for the federal government under the Build-Operate-Transfer model. The construction cost (about USD $800 million) will have to be borne by the client and the client will earn revenue by collecting toll for the next 10 years. Evaluate whether the project is worth investing.\nPossible Answer: \nCandidate: I want to start with the pure financial aspect of project evaluation and will later move onto subjective evaluation criteria.\nInterviewer: That sounds good. Go ahead.\nCandidate: Do we have any information on the approximate cost of construction and the average traffic flow forecast once the highway is complete.\nInterviewer: At present the construction cost of the highway would be about $800 million. A simple net present value (NPV) evaluation after asking for expected inflation rates, rates of interest, toll projections and vehicle traffic projections showed a positive NPV of about $200 million. So do you think we should go ahead with the project?\nCandidate: Right now at least the financials do not indicate a loss so I think it is worth thinking it through and then deciding.\nInterviewer: Really? You think I would be happy earning a meager $200 million on an investment of $800 million? And that too over a distant time horizon of 10 years.\nCandidate: I am not saying the returns are enough. I want to stress on the fact that we should take a look at other perspectives before taking a final decision.\nInterviewer: Ok. Tell me what are the kinds of risks that I am taking if I decide to go ahead with the project?\nCandidate: The primary things that affect the return on investment over here are project construction cost and vehicle traffic in the next 10 years. So any unwanted deviation in their estimates is a big risk. There could be a huge decrease in vehicular traffic if there is an alternate transportation route (train or road) that comes up between points A & B that are connected by the highway we plan to build. We also need to take a look at the overall utility of the highway as in vehicle traffic can be low if other segments in the highway are not completed on time.\nInterviewer: Great answer. So what else? Tell me more about the risks.\nCandidate: Any delay in the construction might attract a penalty from the government and will also affect our cash flow projections (by shifting them further into the future) thus affecting the viability of the project.\nInterviewer: Perfect. Just to let you know, delay in completion is the biggest problem that such infrastructure construction projects face in the United States.\nCandidate: There can also be an adverse effect due to political considerations. Say if the power dynamics changes in the next few years. It might have a different outlook on this project.\nInterviewer: Nice. What else?\nCandidate: We should also look at the land procurement process if any for the construction of the highway. That part often leads to local opposition to such projects and can be harmful for the project.\nInterviewer: Yes, but let us leave that responsibility to the government.\nCandidate: I think I have enumerated all the risks I could think of.\nInterviewer: I think we should give it a stop there. The analysis was pretty good and structured.\nCandidate: Thank you. I really enjoyed doing the case with you. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: business turnaround; math problem.\nConsulting Firm: Oliver Wyman first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: retail.\nCase Interview Question #01030: Your client Foodland is a Canadian chain of grocery stores founded in 1985. Its stores are located mostly in the provinces of New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Ontario. The stores range in size from 4,000 to 27,000 square feet (372 to 2,508 square meters). Foodland stores are viewed as neighborhood supermarkets that focus on a no-frills customer convenience and offering a wide selection of conventional supermarket products such as produce, meats, dairy products, frozen food, dry goods, baked goods and deli products.\nFoodland has been the industry leader for more than 20 years and currently has 25% market share. 5 years ago they experienced growth stall, followed by revenue and profit decline in the last 2 years.  Drop in profitability percentage has been even higher than the drop in revenue. Your consulting firm has been retained to investigate the problem. What is happening and how can you help them turn around the situation?\nPossible Answer:\n1. Case Overview\n• Industry Analysis,\n• Profitability Analysis\n• Turnaround Strategy \n2. Suggested Framework \n• Industry/Market Trends\n• Customer Segmentation/Needs\n• Competition \n3. Gathering Data \n• Has the overall industry been declining?\n• Are there any other competitors facing similar problems?\n• What is the competitive landscape?\n• Have there been new entrants into the market that could explain the reduction in revenue?\n• Who are our client’s target customers? Are they price­‐sensitive?\n• What are some of the ways to cut down costs (Hint: Main competitors have been taking advantage of Internet as a new high margin distribution channel while our client hasn’t been doing that. Internet delivery will cut down on the labor/rent/ maintenance costs). \n4. Additional Information (to be given after relevant questions)\nA. Industry Landscape: New Competitors offering cheaper products \n• The overall supermarket industry in Canada is growing steadily. Other competitors are not experiencing similar problems.\n• There are a few new players who offer unbeatable low-­end offers that have been gaining market share.\n• The second largest player has 23% market share.\nB. Customers\n• Client’s target customers are mid-­to‐upper middle income market.\n• Some of the customers might be price sensitive and hence prefer the cheaper products and switch to the cheaper competition. \nC. Price\nOur client sells better products and could keep doing so to retain and sharpen the focus on upper­‐middle class customers.\n• Price elasticity = -­0.5 (for 10% increase in price demand of product units decreases by 5%).\n• COGS (cost of goods sold) = 60% of revenue\n5. Quantitative Analysis\nSuppose they increase the average unit product price from $10 to $11. As a consequence the COGS will increase by 5%. Is the client going to be profitable with this change in product pricing strategy? \n• Last year revenues were $110 per customer per week.\n• The client had ~1 million customers last year.\n• The number of clients has remained constant but the average spent has declined. \nLast year:\n• Revenue/customer = $110/week * 52 weeks/year = $5,720/year\n• Total Revenue = $5,720 * 1M = $5.720B/year\n• Total Cost = $6B/year\n• COGS = 60% of total costs = $3.6B\n• Other Cost = $6B – $3.6B = $2.4B\n• Profitability = $5.72B ‐ $6B = ‐$0.28B\nEstimates after price change:\n• Revenue/custoer: Average price of 10$ and weekly expenditure of 110$/week implies customers bought 11 units per week. After price increase from $10 to $11, customers will buy 11 units * 95% = 10.45 units, leading to $11 * 10.45 = $114.95 = ~115$.\n• $115/week * 52 weeks = $5,980/year\n• Total Revenue = $5,980/year * 1M = $5.98B/year\n• COGS will increase by 5% = $3.6B * 105% = $3.78B\n• Total Cost = $3.78B + $2.4B = $6.18B\n• Profitability = $5.98 – $6.18B = -$0.2B \nSo overall the profitability would still be negative, but the loss would be less!\n6. Proposed Recommendation\nThe client Foodland has not adapted to two industry trends:\n(1) Hard‐discounters entering the market, and\n(2) Internet delivery as a distribution channel.\nI would recommend restructuring our offerings by going toward high‐end products that have higher margins and match better the target market. We should consider eliminating low‐margin products. We should start an Internet delivery channel ASAP.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

It is the county seat and commercial hub of Westchester, an affluent suburban county just north of New York City. White Plains is located in south-central Westchester, with its downtown (Mamaroneck Avenue) 25 miles (40 km) north of Midtown Manhattan. The city’s close commuting distance to midtown Manhattan (31 minutes by express train) have also attracted a lot of people who commute to New York City for work. As of 2015, the city’s total population was estimated to be around 10,000.\nOur client Sandy and her husband own a small coffee shop located in downtown White Plains. Sandy’s shop currently serves only coffee drinks. Lately the couple is considering diversifying their business by selling bagels in the coffee shop. Is it a good idea? What kind of advice would you give to her? \nPossible Answer:\n1. Case Overview \n• New business, new product offering\n• Understand the market and competitive landscape\n• P&L analysis\n• Identify potential risks\n2. Suggested Framework \n• Market size\n• Economics\n• Barriers to entry\n• Potential risks\n• market entry strategies\n3.

Quantitative Analysis\nA. Competition = low (expect to acquire a market share of 10%) \nB. Market Sizing\nAdditional Data: (to be given after relevant questions)\n• Year-round population in White Plains is 10,000\n• Tourist population amounting to an additional 30,000 people for 6 months of the year.\n• 25% of the year‐round population are bagel buyers; they buy 4 bagels per week.\n• 50% of the tourist population are bagel buyers; they buy 2 bagels per week.\nCalculations: \nAnnual consumption of year‐round population:\n• 25% of year‐round population: 10,000 * 25% = 2,500 year‐round bagel buyers\n• 2,500 year‐round bagel buyers * 4 bagels per week = 10,000 bagels bought weekly.\n• 10,000 * 50 weeks/year = 500,000 bagels per year.\nAnnual consumption of tourist population:\n• 50% of tourist population: 30,000 * 50% = 15,000 bagel buyers\n• 15,000 tourist bagel buyers * 2 bagels per week = 30,000 bagels bought weekly.\n• 30,000 * 25 weeks (approximately 6 months) = 750,000 bagels per year.\nTotal bagel market:\n500,000 + 750,000 = 1.25M bagels/year \nC. Profitability Analysis\nAdditional Data: (to be given after relevant questions)\nThere are 2 manufacturing models for bagels:\n(1) In house built Model\n• Monthly equipment cost of $1,000\n• All other cost amounts to $0.50/bagel\n(2) Outsource Model\n• Cost of one bagel: $0.7\nPrice to sell: $1.25/bagel \nCalculations:\nLet X = the number of bagels sold per month.\n(1) In house model:\n• Profit = $1.25X – ($1,000 + $0.5X) = $0.75X – $1,000\n• To be profitable, X must be greater than $1,000/$0.75 = 1,334 \n(2) Outsource model:\n• Profit = $1.25X – $0.75X = $0.50X\n• So it is always profitable with the outsource model.\nWhen profits from the two models equal to each other:\n• $0.75X – $1,000 = $0.50X,\n• X = 4,000 bagels/month, or 48,000 bagels/year\nSince the client is expected to capture 10% of the market, sales will be 1.25M * 10% = 125,000 bagels/year, or ~10,000 bagels/month.\nWhen X = 10,000\n(1) In house model: Profit = $0.75X – $1,000 = $6,500/month\n(2) Outsource model: Profit = $0.50X = $5,000/month\nConclusion: the client should select the first model: to make the bagels in-house. \n5. Proposed Recommendation\nI recommend our client Sandy to enter this bagel business by developing in house manufacturing capability. Because:\n• The bagel market is very attractive\n• The competition is not intensive\n• The business is more profitable by having in house manufacturing capability.\nAs they continue to pursue this business diversification, some potential risks are the potential drawbacks brought by different product mix (cannibalization effect), by using different marketing channels, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Coolarpess is famous for over ten different brands of beer in North America. The beer company is headquartered and operates a brewery in Portland, Maine.\nRecently, the demand for Coolarpess’ beers has unexpectedly propelled up when American actor Jason Segel featured in an episode of popular CBS sitcom “How I Met Your Mother” drinking a screw cap beer and helping Randy (Will Forte) to start a brewing company named Coolarpess. Beside company name identification, Coolarpess’ beers are sealed with screw caps, too. Coolarpess’ CEO wants your help to adapt to the increased demand. What recommendations would you give him?\nPossible Answer:\nThe goal of the case is voluntarily unclear. The interviewer should first prompt the candidate to discuss case objectives.  Explain to the candidate that due to the surged demand many customer‐orders are being delayed, and that there is a problem with operations. In addition to quantitative components, this case refers to popular issues typical of operation cases: capacity constraint, bottleneck, scheduling. Solutions can come in many flavors: 8 “buckets” of solution are mentioned here.\n1. Suggested Framework\n• Supply chain optimization and operations strategies\n• Demand versus capacity\n• Analysis of bottlenecks\n• Strategies to match supply with demand\n2. Gathering Data\n• How does the beer production process work?\n• Has anything changed in the manufacturing process?\n• What are the capacity constraints and bottlenecks?\n• Compute queuing deficits\n• List some specifics for standard approaches to solving capacity constraint operation issues: optimizing, expanding, outsourcing, price changes\n• Pro‐actively gauge the impact of suggested solutions (e.g., pros/cons table)\n3.

After the episode of How I Met Your Mother aired on TV\n\nSupply Chain: Brewing, filling, bottling in-­‐house every day non‐stop from 8am to 6pm, empty bottles are delivered every morning from manufacturing facility across the street, caps are ordered every month from a supplier located in Florida.\nBefore the episode of How I Met Your Mother aired on TV: Demand = 2,000 bottles / day\nAfter: Demand = 5,000 bottles /day\nCapacity: 5,000 bottles can be imported per day maximum.\nCandidate should brainstorm and propose the following hypothesis: Bottlenecks create inventory build‐up and manufacturing short‐fall.\nSterilizing: 5,000 / day\nFilling: 4,500 / day\nCapping (putting a cap): 4,000 / day\nQuality control: 95% (consider only quality control of bottling to simplify in the case)\nConclusion: See Exhibit 1 and 2.\n5,000 bottles imported per day lead to dramatic queue = deficit of 1,000 bottles per day.\n4. Solutions\nHere is a menu of solutions ranked by speed of implementation: (the candidate should suggest at least three options)\n(1) Add more shifts: Implement a continuous production process (24/7)\n(2) Fix/Reduce the bottlenecks: Analyze production line and see if we can squeeze more bottles out of each shift\n(3) Raise beer prices\n(4) Move quality assurance (QA) before the bottlenecks: 5% out of 4,000 is 200. If quality control is shifted before the bottlenecks, then bottlenecks can operate at 100% (or close to it). This solves for 200 bottles per day.\n(5) Look for labor-saving technologies that can boost production.\n(6) Outsource production (or part of it) to manufacturing facility across the street.\n(7) Outsource production (or part of it) to a bottler.\n(8) Build another production line.\n5. Additional Questions for good candidates\nQuestion 1: What are the factors to consider when choosing the optimal inventory order size (shipment) for screw caps?\n(1) Carrying Costs: costs associated with storage, insurance, and financing the inventory.\n(2) Ordering Costs: costs associated with accounting, labor…when placing an order.\nQuestion 2: Given an optimal inventory order size for screw caps given by the EOQ formula (Economic Order Quantity), how many screw caps should be shipped per order?\nIn corporate finance, Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) is the order quantity that minimizes the total holding costs and ordering costs. EOQ = sqrt(2*R*O/C)\nR = Annual Unit Requirement (consider 360 days per year)\nO = Cost of placing an order (here O = $100),\nC = Cost of carrying a unit of inventory per period (here C = $0.10)\nThe candidate might compute R (360 * 5,000 = 1.8m) and solve for EOQ. But an astute candidate will see that 5,000 is 10,000/2, which simplifies the numerator.\nOne gets EOQ = sqrt(2*360*5,000*$100/$0.1) = sqrt(3,600,000,000) = 60,000 units per shipment (= 1 shipment every 12 days).\nQuestion 3: You have presented your recommendations to the CEO. He opts for extra shifts. What are the pros and cons of adding more shifts using current workers?\nPros: Save on hiring and training cost of new employees, and flexibility to get back to former production levels if demand softens.\nCons: Possible worker burnout, might lower quality control rate, lower profit per bottle.\n6. Recommendation\nWe identified the root cause of the problem. As demand exceeds supply due to capacity constraints, bottlenecks create deficit build-­up and manufacturing short‐fall.\nWe identified short and long term solutions. I recommend adding more shifts, which will notably allow our client to easily get back to prior production levels if needed.\nFinally I recommend optimizing production by adding a quality assurance (QA) before the sterilizing phase, and optimizing inventories by ordering 60,000 screw caps every 12 days.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: operations strategy, marketing; organizational behavior.\nConsulting Firm: ZS Associates 2nd round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: telecommunications & network.\nCase Interview Question #01033: Your client United States Cellular Corporation (NYSE: USM), doing business as U.S. Cellular, is a telecommunications company that owns and operates the fifth-largest wireless network in the United States. U.S. Cellular serves 4.9 million customers in 426 markets in 23 U.S. states as of the first quarter of 2016. The company has its headquarters in Chicago, Illinois.\nU.S. Cellular has a customer acquisition cost of $400 per customer, which is on a par with other U.S. wireless providers such as Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint. Off late the client has started facing a customer churn ratio of 3% which is significantly higher than the industry average of 2%. Your consulting firm has been hired by U.S. Cellular to investigate the issue. Specifically, there are two main tasks for you: \n(1) In real life how would you go about collecting data to investigate such problems?\n(2) Find the reason for the increase in customer churn ratio.\nAdditional Information:\nChurn ratio or churn rate (sometimes called attrition rate), in its broadest sense, is a measure of the number of individuals or items moving out of a collective group over a specific period of time. It is one of two primary factors that determine the steady-state level of customers a business will support.\nThe term is used in many contexts, but is most widely applied in business with respect to a contractual customer base. For instance, it is an important factor for any business with a subscriber-based service model, including mobile telephone networks and pay TV operators. Churn rate is an important input into customer lifetime value modeling, and can be part of a simulator used to measure ROI using marketing mix modeling.\nChurn rate, when applied to a customer base, refers to the proportion of contractual customers or subscribers who leave a supplier during a given time period. It is a possible indicator of customer dissatisfaction, cheaper and/or better offers from the competition, more successful sales and/or marketing by the competition, or reasons having to do with the customer life cycle.\nPossible Answer:\n1. Case Overview\nThis is a totally qualitative case which does not require any number crunching or calculations.\nLet the interviewee come up with as many possible causes for the problem as possible. The interviewer can use the “what else” approach. Focus on how the interviewee structures the problem and whether he/she covers the main points.\nA solid interviewee will try to bring his/her own experiences into the case. Like: If he/she were to buy a cellular phone then what factors will affect the decision making process.\n2. Suggested Structure\n\nIncreasing Churn Rate:\na. Pricing\nb. Product/Services\n– Flexibility of plans\n– Customer support\n– Quality and coverage\n– Add-ons\nc. Promotion/Sales/Placement\n– Indirect\n– Direct\n3. Detailed Analysis\na. List of high level “pain areas”\nAsk the interviewee to come up with potential sources of increase in customer churn ratio. Let him/her brain storm on the possible high level “pain areas”.\nPossible questions to guide the interviewee:\n‐- Have you ever shopped for a cellular phone? Where did you buy it from?\n‐- What factors do you think affect the decision making process of a cellular phone customer?\nPossible answers:\n‐- The high level “pain areas” can either be Pricing or Product/Services or Promotion/Sales/Advertising\nb. Explore each high level “pain area” in more details\nPossible questions to guide the interviewee:\n‐- How do you regard the competition in the wireless telecommunications industry in the United States? Is it fierce, mild or non-existent? (the interviewee should correctly guess that it is a fairly competitive industry even though there are only a limited number of players).\n‐- Given that it is a fairly competitive industry, do you think Pricing can be a issue? (the interviewee should realize at this point that Pricing could not be a “pain area”)\n‐- How would you further sub‐divide the Product/Services bucket? (possible sub‐divisions include flexibility of plans, customer support, voice quality and coverage area, add‐ons like ringtones, picture messaging, etc. Once the interviewee starts hitting the wall, you can ask him/her to move on to the next “pain area”).\nc. Explore “Sales” pain area in more details\nPossible questions to guide the interviewee:\n‐- What do you think are the major sales channels for wireless service providers? (possible answers include direct/company owned sales channels and indirect/third party sales channels)\n‐- Which one do you think is more likely to have a problem? Why? (the interviewee should correctly identify the control problems in the indirect sales channel. He/she should question the incentive structure for this particular channel and ask questions about reward mechanism in place).\n‐- What steps do you suggest to mitigate this problem? (possible solutions include: better incentive structure. Performance based reward system, better margins to sales people, etc.)\nConclusion: In this case, the problem is with the indirect sales channel (small shops which sell products and services from multiple providers). There are not enough incentives for the sellers to promote the product/services from our client. Hence, the indirect sales people tend to promote products from other providers to our customers leading to a higher churn ratio.\nd. Data collection in real life\nPossible questions to guide the interviewee:\n‐- What are possible sources of data? (Customer surveys, research reports)\n‐- Are customer surveys good enough? (they can be biased)\n‐- How would you analyze the data and account for the bias? (use regression tools)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The company specializes in the discovery, development, and delivery of therapies for the treatment of neurodegenerative,  hematologic, cancer, and autoimmune diseases to patients worldwide.\nBiogen has recently developed an ultra fast treatment for dyspepsia. Also known as indigestion, dyspepsia is a condition of impaired digestion. Symptoms may include upper abdominal fullness, heartburn, nausea, belching, or upper abdominal pain. Traditional therapies used for dyspepsia include lifestyle modification, antacids, H2-receptor antagonists (H2-RAs), prokinetic agents, and antiflatulents. It has been noted that one of the most frustrating aspects of treating functional dyspepsia is that these traditional agents have been shown to have little or no efficacy.\nBiogen’s CEO believes their new drug for dyspepsia is revolutionary. Take the pill and symptoms disappear within the hour. The CEO wants your help to fix the price. What would you recommend?\nPossible Answer:\n1. Overview of Case and Expectations \n• New product launching and pricing strategies\n• Creative thinking for non-industry experts: side effects of the new drug, coverage by insurance, etc.\n• Think about who really are the customers: patients, physicians, hospitals, …\n• Creative thinking about value proposition (e.g.: benchmark price of commodities) \n2. Suggested Framework \n• Product characteristics and target market\n• Market sizing\n• Competitor benchmarking\n• Economic value to the consumer \n3. Recommended Approach\n• Are there side effects, can both male and female use the pill, OTC or prescription?\n• Define and size the market (adult males and females)\n• How much more efficient is the new drug compared to similar products?\n• Disadvantages compared to other similar products? Spectrum of substitutions.\n• Based on all costs including R&D, manufacturing, marketing, propose a price for a significant markup, targeting the high end of competitors’ price range.\n• Extend beyond the standard pricing model, draw a price line, consider what the market is willing to pay for similar value propositions (e.g. wellness, healthy diets)\n4. Quantitative Analysis\nA. Product characteristics\n• Clinical trials showed side effects limited to frequent migraine (i.e. not to be advised for children), with similar results for males and females.\n• During clinical trials 75% of patients stopped reporting symptoms using 2 pills/day.\n• Can be sold OTC => patient is the real customer \nB. Competition\n• Traditional Treatments (antacids, prokinetics, H2-­‐RA and PPI agents) are all popular for their frustratingly low efficacy: in >50% of patients, herbal products such as ginger or peppermint generally have as much anti‐dyspeptic effect as the best in­‐class medications.\n• Prices range from $15 to $50 for a month supply with posology from 2 to 3 pills/day.\nC. Market Sizing\n• US population = 320 million, consider only 20-­80 year-olds\n• Assume biases, for instance an higher prevalence in young professionals (stress-­induced) and an higher willingness in elderlies (who generally take pills every day).\n\n\nAge\n#\nAffected\n#\nTreated\n#\nTotal\n\n\n0‐20\n80M\n-\n-\n-\n0\n\n\n\n20-40\n80M\n40%\n32M\n50%\n16M\n\n\n\n40-60\n80M\n20%\n16M\n50%\n8M\n\n\n\n60-80\n80M\n20%\n16M\n100%\n16M\n40M\n\n\nD. Costs \n• R&D Cost = $100 million\n• Manufacturing (marginal cost) = $0.50 per pill\n• Marketing and sales (effective cost per pill) = $0.50/pill\n5. Proposed Conclusion \n• I recommend advertising lab results & targeting the high end of competitive prices.\n• 1-­month supply of competitors’ pill amounts to $50 and since in the US people tend to spend a few extra bucks every day for a healthy diet, I believe that we can target up to $100 for 1-­month supply of our new drug. This means $2/pill, or 100% markup.\n\n• With this $1/pill ­profit margin, breakeven is 100 million pills. Assume patients take 2 pills a day, 250 days per year, then we would need 100M / (2*250) = 200,000 customers to break even in the first year. This represents only 200,000/40M = 0.5% share of total addressable market.\n• If we are able to tap 5% of the total US market (40M * 5% = 2M), we’re looking at $2/pill * 2 pills/day * 250 days/year * 2M = $2 billion earnings per year. Our CEO was right, this is a billion dollar drug! \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: math problem, brain teaser.\nConsulting Firm: NERA Economic Consulting 1st round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage:  None\nCase Interview Question #01024: A very long rope is tied around the equator of the Earth drawing a circle centered at the center of the Earth. If you add 200 meters to the length of the rope, you get another circle, still centered at the center of the Earth but with an expanded radius. How high above the ground would the new rope sit?\nPossible Answer:\nThis mini case is a simple brain teaser which is often used as ice breaker at the very beginning of consulting case interviews. The key here is to find a relevant starting point (here the formula for the perimeter of a circle), and to make simplifying assumptions (for instance, pi = 3, Earth is perfectly spherical, etc).\n1. Suggested Framework \n• Assume the Earth is perfectly spherical\n• Circumference of a circle = 2*pi*r\n2. Recommended Approach\nPerimeter of a circle (to give only if interviewee is lost):  2*pi*r with r = the radius of the circle.\nReasoning: Start with a circle of radius r. By adding 200 meters to the length of the rope, we get a new circle (with the same center) but with a new radius R. The difference (R-­r) gives the height above the equator where the extended rope will sit.\n3. Quantitative Analysis\n• Length of the equator = circumference = 2*pi*r, r = radius of the earth\n– Approximate pi to be equal to 3 to simplify calculations\n• If we increase the length of the rope by 200 meters, the new length will be C = 2*pi*r + 200\n• C = 2*pi*R, R is the new radius, (R-r) is the height above the ground where the rope sits.\n• Solve 2*pi*R = 2*pi*r + 200 for R => R = r + 200/(2*pi)\n• R-­r is what we are looking for => R-­r = 200/(2*pi) = 100/pi\n4. Conclusion\nIt is not necessary to know the initial radius of the earth to solve this problem.  \nBy using the formula for the radius of a circle and the amount of rope added to what we had initially, we are able to compute (R-­r), i.e. the height above the ground where the extended rope sits.\nThe height above the ground is R-­r = 100/pi = 100/3 = ~33 meters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Hoffmann-La Roche AG (SIX: ROG) is a multinational health-care company that operates worldwide under two divisions: Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics. The company headquarters are located in Basel, Switzerland and the company has many pharmaceutical and diagnostic sites around the world.\nRoche is in the process of developing a therapy for lymphoma. The Managing Director of Roche’s lymphoma therapy project came to you for help in designing the clinical trial. How should you proceed?\nLymphoma is a general term for any type of cancer that attacks the lymphatic system. Signs and symptoms may include enlarged lymph nodes, fever, drenching sweats, unintended weight loss, itching, and feeling tired. The two main categories of lymphomas are Hodgkin lymphomas (HL) and the non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). Current treatment of lymphoma may involve one or more of the following: chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and surgery.\nPossible Answer:\nThis is a typical pharmaceutical case to test a candidate’s understanding of the industry. \n1. Suggested Framework \n• Lymphoma disease space (types and stages of lymphoma, epidemiology, existing therapy, pros and cons, etc)\n• The client Roche’s therapy (treatment or management, which indication, safety, etc)\n• Indication selection (type and stage)\n• Clinical trial location and phases (US or other countries, safety, efficacy, etc)\n• End point measurement.\n2.

Current treatment:\n• No effective treatment yet, only management therapies to alleviate symptoms using radiotherapy and chemotherapy.\n• Not specific for lymphoma.\n• Risks and harm outweigh the benefits.\ne. Client’s therapy:\n• Non-aggressive management therapy intended for both types of lymphoma.\n• Low risks and safety shown in animal studies.\nf. Funding availability:\n• Client has sufficient funds to run multiple trials \ng. Five-­year survival rate:\n• Percentage of patients that are alive five years after their disease is diagnosed.\n4. Proposed Recommendation\na. Start the clinical trial in the U.S. and target only patients with non-­Hodgkin lymphoma:\n• U.S. has one of the largest lymphoma patient population and growing number of patients each year.\n• Clinical trial is costly ($2B on development of a drug and mostly spent on clinical trial); start with only one indication at first and once it passes Phase II, we can consider launch the other one. \nb. Recruit patients from the Distant Stage group and use 5-­year survival rate for trial end indication. Most patients were diagnosed as distant and the 5-­year survival rate is the lowest among the other stages of lymphoma. It is easier to prove efficacy in the 5-­year survival rate of Distant patient population. \nc. If asked, provide the following info:\n• Phase I‐safety (figure out dosage, frequency, clearance, side effects etc);\n• Phase II-­efficacy (5‐year survival rate);\n• Phase III‐final confirmation on safety and efficacy (large trial, double blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled);\n• Phase IV-post marketing surveillance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The client Duolingo has 60% market share in the remote video interpreter business and the rest of the market is very fragmented.\n• New industries brainstorms:\n– Retail\n– Hospitality and travel\n– Government and public sector\n– Healthcare (client chooses to focus on the healthcare industry)\n– Legal\n– Insurance\n– Utilities\n– Banking and finance\n– Real estate\n5. Quantitative Analysis\nA. Healthcare market\nDemand: 1 in 7 patient needs an interpreter\nExisting service: in-person interpreter\nPrice: $30/hour + $50 travel cost\nAverage time needed: 2 hours\n# of patients per year in the US: 35M\n# of hospitals in the US: 5,000\nCalculations:\n35M / 5,000 hospitals = 7M patients/hospital\n7M / 7 = 1M patients in need of interpreter services\nCost of an interpreter = $30/hour * 2 hours + $50 = $110\n1M * $110 = $110M (total cost to hospital for in-person interpreter service)\nB. Client’s video interpreter service\nNew market entry: no R&D needed, existing technology can be directly used in the healthcare industry.\nComparative services: in-person interpreter.\nCompetition: no other video interpreter service available in the market.\nWho still requires an in-person interpreter: patients with severe or terminal illness, dementia, or suffering from emotional disorder (10% of patient population).\nCurrent fee ($/year) in each airport: $1M training and service charge + $0.02 per-minute fee\nIf hospitals decide to switch to the Client’s video interpreter service\nAmong the 1M patients in need of interpreter services:\n1M * 10% = 100,000 patients still requires an in-person interpreter\n1M * 90% = 900,000 patients can use video interpreter service\nNew cost to hospitals:\n100,000 * $110 = $11M (cost for in-person required patients)\n900,000 * $0.02/min * 120min (2 hours) + 1M training and service charge = $3.16M (video interpreter service cost)\nTotal = $3.16 + $11M = $14.16M (total cost to provide interpreter service to all 1M patients)\n$14.16M/110M = 13%\nConclusion: Switching to the client’s video interpreter service will save each hospital 87% in patient interpreting service cost.\n6. Recommendation\na. The client Duolingo should expand its video interpreter service into another industry, since there is no growth potential in the airline industry.\nb. The healthcare industry is very promising, because it is very costly and time-consuming for hospitals to provide in-person interpreter services to patients.\nc. If the client Duolingo applies the same pricing structure from the airline industry to the healthcare industry, it is able to save each hospital more than 85% in patient interpreting service cost each year.\nd. The client’s selling point: competitive price, value-added service, on-site service 24/7, etc.\ne. Barriers to entry/risks: new technology implementation, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: estimate, guesstimate ; finance, economics.\nConsulting Firm: Bridgespan Group first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: agriculture, farming, aquaculture; government, public sector.\nCase Interview Question #01019: Food security is a condition related to the supply of food, and individuals’ access to it. At the 1974 World Food Conference the term “food security” was defined with an emphasis on supply. Food security, they said, is the “availability at all times of adequate world food supplies of  basic foodstuffs to sustain a steady expansion of food consumption and to offset fluctuations in production and prices”. Later definitions of food security added demand and access issues to the definition. The final report of the 1996 World Food Summit states that food security “exists when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life”.\nWe have been hired by the Indian government to solve the food security problem in India. How would you go about it? \nPossible Answer:\nCandidate: What do you mean by food?\nInterviewer: We also started there, good. If I tell you there were four baskets of food, what would be the four?\nCandidate: Cereals, pulses, fruits & vegetables, and …spice?\nInterviewer: No, oilseeds. Why do you think the food security problem happens?\nCandidate: I think it boils down to the demand-supply gap.\nInterviewer: Could you explain a bit more?\nCandidate: The country’s population is rising and food habits are changing. Agriculture still produces traditional types of food, whereas consumption is changing amongst the new generation. Farm efficiency is also low in India. The supply is also being affected due to changing weather because of global warming. Moreover, farmland is becoming less and less and there are certain regulations there on changing marshland into farmland.\nInterviewer: How will you estimate or quantify supply and demand? Take something – like cereals? What will you look for, in the short term and long term, why would you choose it?\nCandidate: I would start with long term, break it into short term.\nInterviewer: What is long term for you – 2020, 2030, 2050?\nCandidate: I would want to take 2030 – 10 or 20 year plan necessary – since you have to change a lot of macro level issues.\nInterviewer: How will you estimate demand and supply?\nCandidate: I would use the population data, past stats of how food consumption has been and look at other similar countries for example China, and how their demand has changed. I would also look at income.\nCandidate performed calculations taking: population = 1.2 Billion, 5% growth, next 5 years, per-capita income (real terms, 35000), extrapolate for 3 years.\nCandidate: I would also look at ways to improve farming efficiency.\nInterviewer: OK. Would you expect the same trends to continue at the same rate of growth, etc?\nCandidate: I suppose that if there were any major regulatory changes, then there would be fundamental shift. But since our client is the government, it would be in a position to anticipate those changes, and can hence account for them.\nInterviewer: Very good. That would be all.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The client Reliance Communications Ltd. (RCOM) is an Indian telecommunications company headquartered in Navi Mumbai, India. It provides CDMA, GSM (Voice, 2G, 3G) mobile services, fixed line broadband and voice services, DTH depending upon the areas of operation. Reliance Communications is the fourth largest telecom operator in India with about 110 million subscribers as of June 2015.\nThe client Reliance Communications has hired us because it wants to increase its revenues and grow in this saturated market. What would you advise? What are some of the growth strategies the client could employ?\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate: Can I take a few seconds to structure my thoughts?\nInterviewer: Sure of course.\nCandidate: I would like to start by understanding the telecom market in India, looking at the revenue drivers and advise the client on which ones they could use. I understand that the telecom sector works by hiring its services from tower operators and then use their own brand name and services to generate revenues.\nInterviewer: True. Our client Reliance Communications too hires such service at market rates.\nCandidate: Okay. Then I shall explore the meaning of saturated market. Has the client explored all geographies? Like the whole of rural market? I recently read that we have about 680 million telecom connections. So, I believe there is still some untapped market to explore.\nInterviewer: Right. There is indeed an untapped market. Let us go on and say the rural market has been penetrated to the extent possible and they have probably done what they could in that respect.\nCandidate: Okay. So assuming a saturated market, we should look at increasing revenue from existing consumers. We could analyse the existing calls being done and could think of schemes like STD call rate packages, local call packages, local and STD SMS packages that suit to the area to increase per user usage. The idea would be to have lower rates more than compensated by higher usage.\nInterviewer: Good, what else?\nCandidate: We could look at various value-added services like revenues through internet services on mobiles. Having different plans and offering better speeds, we can get more consumers to use internet on their mobiles. Also, with 3G technology, mobile internet will surely be a huge source of revenues.\nInterviewer: Good. Anything else?\nCandidate: Also from games and applications. There are many businesses coming up in the area of mobile gaming and product development of applications. We could buy them and use them as sources of additional revenue.\nInterviewer: Okay, thanks for the inputs. We will now move to the next interview. Thanks for your time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Referred to in the media as the “Baadshah of Bollywood”, “King of Bollywood” or “King Khan”, he has appeared in more than 80 Bollywood films, and earned numerous ￼ accolades. In terms of audience size and income, he has been described as one of the most successful film stars in the world. Shah Rukh Khan regularly features in listings of the most influential people in Indian culture, and in 2008, Newsweek named him one of their fifty most powerful people in the world.\nAs of 2015, Mr. Shah Rukh Khan is co-chairman of the motion picture production company Red Chillies Entertainment and its subsidiaries, and is the co-owner of the Indian Premier League cricket team Kolkata Knight Riders. Recently, he has just received an offer to invest in a professional football club in India. He has requested for your advice in this regard. What would you tell him?\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate: So our client Mr. Shah Rukh Khan owns a stake in a cricket club, and he has received an offer to diversify his portfolio by investing in a football club. We are to advise him regarding the pros and cons of investing in the football club.\nInterviewer: Yes, that’s correct.\nCandidate: I would appreciate a few moments to structure my thoughts.\nInterviewer: Sure.\nCandidate: We can split the potential returns from this investment into two categories. The first category involves direct monetary returns from the football club. The second consists of the PR benefits and publicity which the film star would gain through his association with the football club, and with football in general.\nInterviewer: OK.\nCandidate: Direct monetary returns from the football club can be split up into revenues from sale of tickets at matches, Ad revenues from advertising in stadium, etc.\nInterviewer: OK. Can you describe the other parts?\nCandidate: Well, our client Shah Rukh Khan is already known for his association with cricket, besides his previous popular films also have helped link him with other less popular sports in India. This would build on that image and would further improve his image with the public.\nInterviewer: Do you think the PR benefits would be sufficient to justify buying a professional football club. We know he’s rich, but he’s not that rich.\nCandidate: OK, so returning to the monetary benefits, there are a number of ways in which our client can use his popularity to successfully monetize the football club. He can promote the game and the club in schools, etc.\nInterviewer: So he can invest in this and get returns. Should we advise him to do it or not?\nCandidate: Well, there are other factors as well. We need to judge this investment against other investment opportunities which are available to him at the time. Based on analysis of returns from each option he would made a better decision.\nInterviewer: Can you comment on the growth opportunities in football vs. other sports, say hockey, in India?\nCandidate: Well, football is arguably the most popular sport in the world, much more so than hockey. It has not been adopted completely in India, but given its popularity around the world, there is significant scope for growth in the popularity of football in India. It also is very suitable as a spectator sport. The ball is bigger and easier to follow than in hockey. People can see and follow the game easily. At the end of the day, it’s a more exciting game.\nInterviewer: Great. That’s it for the case. Thank you!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

(Euronext: CA) is a French multinational retailer headquartered in Boulogne Billancourt, France, in the Hauts-de-Seine Department near Paris. Carrefour is one of the largest hypermarket chains in the world (with close to 1,600 hypermarkets at the end of 2015), the fourth largest retail group in the world in terms of revenue (after Wal-Mart, Tesco and Costco), and the second in profit (after Wal-Mart). Carrefour operates in more than 30 countries, in Europe, the Americas, Asia and Africa.\nRecently, the management of Carrefour reviewed its situation under conditions of stagnant growth and increasing competition from international rivals like Wal-Mart, Tesco, etc. A team of consultants has been hired to evaluate the retail giant’s performance. As one of case team members, what metrics would you use to evaluate Carrefour’s performance?\nPossible Answer:\nNote: Performance metrics measure an organization’s activities and performance. It should support a range of stakeholder needs from customers, shareholders to employees. While traditionally many metrics are finance based, inwardly focusing on the performance of the organization, metrics may also focus on the performance against customer requirements and value.\nCandidate: Before going to the analysis, I would like to figure out what are the overall market size, company environment, the industry and then the company’s performance metrics.\nInterviewer: That’s not necessary. Why don’t we concentrate on the performance metrics of the company only?\nCandidate: OK, can I take a minute to organize my thoughts?\nInterviewer: Sure, take your time.\nCandidate: I will find out the following metrics:\n1. Working capital cycle\nThe working capital cycle (WCC) is the amount of time it takes to turn the net current assets and current liabilities into cash. The longer the cycle is, the longer a business is tying up capital in its working capital without earning a return on it. Therefore, companies strive to reduce their working capital cycle by collecting receivables quicker or sometimes stretching accounts payable.\n2. Free cash flow\nFree cash flow (FCF) or free cash flow to firm (FCFF) is a way of looking at a business’s cash flow to see what is available for distribution among all the securities holders of a corporate entity. Free cash flow can be calculated in various ways, depending on audience and available data. A common measure is to take the earnings before interest and taxes multiplied by (1 – tax rate), add depreciation and amortization, and then subtract changes in working capital and capital expenditure.\n3. Revenue trends\n4. COGS (cost of goods sold) trends\n5. Profit margin\n6. Interest coverage\n7. Interest payment ratio\nIf the growth of COGS is greater than growth of revenue then there could be something wrong. Revenue per square foot is also an important performance metric to be looked at.\nInterviewer: Revenue per Sq.Ft is not that important and that metric could be kept aside. You can also look at inventory turnover as an important metric to evaluate the firm.\nNote: In accounting, the inventory turnover is a measure of the number of times inventory is sold or used in a time period such as a year. The equation for inventory turnover equals the cost of goods sold (COGS) or net sales divided by the average inventory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

It comprises numerous subsidiaries and affiliated businesses, most of them united under the Samsung brand, and is the largest South Korean business conglomerate.\nThe client Samsung has just acquired R2 Biosystems Inc., an agrochemical and biotech startup company based in Boston, Massachusetts. The biotech startup R2 Biosystems has recently developed a revolutionary chemical compound that helps control ripening of perishables. Small scale preliminary testing confirmed that this chemical works best with apples, and enables earlier harvest and improves apples quality. The CEO of Samsung asked us if they should go about commercializing this new product. How would you go about this problem? If your recommendation is a “Go”, how much should the product be priced?\nPossible Answer:\n1. Suggested Framework \n• Market opportunity (market size, market growth, competition, ROI)\n• Pricing (cost-based pricing, value based pricing)\n• Risks (regulation, patent issues, FDA approval, poisoning, crop cross effects)\n• Opportunity cost\n2. Recommended Approach\n• Approach the problem by considering a pilot test in local (redirect toward Maine!)\n– What is the size of the initial pilot (Maine) market?\n– How does the harvesting business work?\n– How is it growing?  \n• Compute ROI\n– What might be the benefit to apple farmers?\n– What are the incremental revenues from yield increase?\n– What are cost savings due to earlier harvest? \n• Price the product based on exceptional economic value to farmers.  \n3. Quantitative Analysis\nA. Additional Information\n(1) Maine local test market\n• 200 orchards\n• Average revenue: $30K/acre\n• On average 100 acres per orchard\n• 1 apple harvest per year\n• Assume GDP growth\n(2) Revenue breakdown for apple farmers\n• 25% from apples\n• 75% from apple juice \n(3) Benefit to apple farmers\n• 10% yield increase in apples\n• 6% yield increase in apple juice\n• 10 day earlier harvest \n(4) Cost of product\n• $100K for 200 acre farm \n(5) Cost to keep the farm running\n• 1.5K/night/orchard \nB. Calculations\n• Maine market size: 200 orchards * 100 acres/orchard * $30K/acre = $600M per annum\n• Incremental revenue for farmers: $30K/acre * (25% * 10% + 75% * 6%) = $2,100/acre\n• Cost savings for farmers: $1.5K/100 acre * 10 days = $150/acre\n• Cost of product: $100K for 200 acre = $500 per acre\nPrice range: Between ($2,100 + $150 = $2,250/acre) and $500/acre (product cost)\n4. Proposed Conclusion \n(a) Yes, the client should enter the market given its size and ROI potential.\n(b) The client can price the product with a significant margin based on huge benefit to farmers.\n(c) But there are certain risks associated with commercialization:\n• USDA/FDA regulation\n• Patent/Intellectual property (IP) protection\n• Test market in Maine may not be representative of overall US market\n• The new chemical might be harmful to other crops.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Consulting first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: financial services.\nCase Interview Question #01009: The client UBS AG (NYSE: UBS) is a Swiss global financial services company, incorporated in the Canton of Zurich, and co-headquartered in Zurich and Basel. The firm provides wealth management, asset management, and investment banking services for private, corporate, and institutional clients worldwide. UBS is considered the world’s largest manager of private wealth assets. In 2014, UBS’ assets under management (AuM) amounted to USD $1,966.9 billion.\nUBS Wealth Management has been operating in India for the last ten years. However, it has faced significant profitability issues in its operations since the very beginning. Now it wants to make a decision on whether to continue to operate in India. What are your thoughts on this? What would you recommend them do?\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate: (Took two minutes to come up with a structure on paper) Although I have an idea about the wealth management services industry in general, could you tell me more about the industry so I can proceed ahead with a clearer idea?\nInterviewer: Sure. Our client UBS competes in the wealth management services space which essentially means that we cater to people who have wealth that needs external management. High-net-worth individuals (HNWIs), small-business owners and families who desire the assistance of a credentialed financial advisory specialist call upon wealth managers to coordinate retail banking, estate planning, legal resources, tax professionals and investment management. Basically we provide all kinds of services that help them deposit, invest and grow their wealth.\nCandidate: Okay, so in that case I am right in assuming that we cater to high net worth individuals?\nInterviewer: As of now, we only cater to high net worth individuals.\nCandidate: Is our firm an Indian firm or does it have external presence?\nInterviewer: We are a firm with global presence and have retail banking services in Europe and America. In India, we have not explored the possibility of retail banking yet.\nCandidate: Before I analyze our prospects for growth and reinvestment, I would first like to gain more information about the market and our competitors. What is the size of the market and expected growth rate? What is our market share?\nInterviewer: The market as you can imagine is a fairly small market for us due to our stringent conditions on high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) customers. It has been expected to grow at 10% CAGR but this has not reflected in the growth of our business. We cannot be certain about our market share since the HNWI market is not clearly defined. The definition of HNWI differs from organization to organization.\nCandidate: Okay. How many players exist in the market and what kind of competition are we facing?\nInterviewer: While we are one of three foreign wealth management services in the country, domestic retail banks are coming up with new products similar to wealth management services.\nCandidate: Great, now that I have a background about the market environment, I think I should analyze the issue of profitability for our client.\nInterviewer: Fair enough.\nCandidate: For analyzing profitability, we would have to look at revenues and costs incurred by the firm. The main costs that could be incurred are rentals on premises, technology costs, equipment and employee wages. For revenues we should first segment our customers by product category and analyze how we charge them for the services that we offer.\nInterviewer: What do you think is the primary source of revenue for us?\nCandidate: I think we use the deposits with us to make profitable investments and earn our fees through interests on the investments.\nInterviewer: That’s good. Why do you think profitability has been fluctuating in this model?\nCandidate: There could be several reasons for this:\n1. The number of customers we have is low.\n2. Our investment strategy could be flawed.\n3. The economic scenario might not be permitting significant profit making.\nInterviewer: Let’s assume that we have a very small customer base. What might be the reasons for that?\nCandidate: There are three reasons why we could have a small customer base:\n1. Low awareness among the HNWI category.\n2. Negative Brand Image of the firm.\n3. Very few customers qualify our HNWI norms. \nInterviewer: OK, what do you think we should do if we decide to continue to operate in India?\nCandidate: A few measures that could be implemented are:\n1. Increasing brand awareness and strengthening our reputation leveraging our strong presence in foreign countries.\n2. Conducting market research on the Indian consumers to understand the income segmentation.\n3. Develop customized products for the top 3 high income segments.\nInterviewer: That sounds good.

Kearney (India Office) first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage:  entertainment, performing arts.\nCase Interview Question #01010: Shah Rukh Khan (born Shahrukh Khan, 2 November 1965), also known as SRK, is an Indian film actor, producer and television personality. Referred to in the media as the “Baadshah of Bollywood”, “King of Bollywood” or “King Khan”, he has appeared in more than 80 Bollywood films, and earned numerous accolades, including 14 Filmfare Awards. Khan has a significant following in Asia and the Indian diaspora worldwide. In terms of audience size and income, he has been described as one of the most successful film stars in the world. He regularly features in listings of the most influential people in Indian culture, and in 2008, Newsweek named him one of their fifty most powerful people in the world.\nShah Rukh Khan, now 50 years old, has recently started to feel that his acting career is about to get over soon. He has a net worth of USD $100 million and thinks that this amount might not be enough for his three kids. So, he has hired you as a consultant to help him find ways to multiply his net worth. What can you suggest?\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate: As far as I know, Shah Rukh Khan currently owns two businesses: a motion picture production company, Red Chillies Entertainment, and an Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket team, Kolkata Knight Riders. I think he should be looking for more such investments to help him increase his net worth. This is because traditional investment opportunities like the stock market, property, gold, etc. would not help him multiply his wealth.\nInterviewer: That’s correct. We’re currently looking at only those investment opportunities that would help him leverage his brand of a successful household name. Why don’t you try to make a laundry list of ideas that come to your mind?\nCandidate: Sure. To begin with, he could use the success of his motion picture production company to set up a record label like Sony Music or T-series. No other movie star currently owns a record label. He could use his network to tie-up with production houses to ensure the initial success of such a company.\nSecond, he could open up an acting school on the lines of the Anupam Kher Acting School. Since Shah Rukh Khan is a much bigger brand, he could use it to compete with the existing acting schools in the country.\nThird, he could start a talk show on television. Oprah Winfrey is one of the richest women in the world because of her talk shows!\nFourth, he could invest in sports other than cricket. He could buy an F-1 team or invest in the European Football clubs.\nInterviewer: Do you think investing in F-1 or football clubs in Europe would effectively leverage the SRK brand?\nCandidate: No, it wouldn’t. Shah Rukh Khan is a popular household name only among Indians across the globe. In that case, I would want to focus on such investments only in the Indian sub-continent. He could set up a premier league of a sport like hockey or football in India.\nInterviewer: Which sport would you choose?\nCandidate: I would choose football over hockey. This is because football is a global sport and it is somehow cooler to be a good football player than a good hockey player. Though hockey is our national sport, I see football having a better future in the country.\nInterviewer: Fair enough. Any other ideas you can think of?\nCandidate: He could set up his own clothing line. He could also start his own line of perfumes, watches and other similar accessories. Quite a few Hollywood actors already have such product lines. He could launch his own fitness or entertainment magazine, set up a radio channel or own a television network.\nInterviewer: I think this is a pretty comprehensive list. Good job!\nP.S. This case interview ended with the following 30 second pitches to ‘Shah Rukh Khan’:\n1. Choose an idea that you think is worth investing. Convince SRK to invest in it.\n2. Choose an idea that you think is totally ridiculous. Imagine that SRK is very bullish on this idea. Convince him not to invest in it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

In addition, we should also find out about Government regulations with windmills and incentives to green energy sources.\nInterviewer: Good, but exactly how will you evaluate?\nCandidate: We should calculate IRR (Internal Rate Of Return), from potential revenues and costs. The costs involved are…\nInterviewer: Wait. Let us begin with the revenues.\nCandidate: Okay. How does one sell power in India? When you link to the grid and supply power, how do you get paid?\nInterviewer: You sign a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with the government before you connect to the grid. It is like this: You supply X units at Y price. Let us assume the wind farm will produce and supply 100MW (megawatt) at Rs.6 per KWH.\nCandidate: (Candidate starts drawing a sample windpower generation graph on the paper)\nInterviewer: Please assume 95% efficiency and give me the numbers quickly. No, let’s just assume 100% efficiency.\nCandidate: 100MW = 100,000KW. 1 year = 24 hour/day * 365 days = 8,760 hours. So, total capacity will be 100,000KW * 8,760 hours = 876,000,000 KWH. At Rs.6 per KWH, that would be Rs.6 * 876,000,000 = Rs.525.6 crores per year.\nInterviewer: Okay, let us proceed to the costs part.\nCandidate: There would be both fixed costs and variable costs. Fixed Costs are the cost of purchasing the turbine, blades, equipment for grid transfer and purchase of land. Is the land purchased or rented?\nInterviewer: It is purchased. You are forgetting two more fixed costs – the cost of transporting equipment to the site and the cost of commissioning the equipment.\nCandidate: Okay. The variable costs would be salary for staff, maintenance cost and the downtime cost.\nInterviewer: Assume the variable costs put together are 10% of total revenues. Calculate the break-even period.\nCandidate: That would leave us with a contribution of Rs.525.6 * 90% = Rs.473 crores. How do I estimate the fixed costs?\nInterviewer: A general rule of thumb you can use for the fixed costs is Rs.16 crore / MW capacity installed.\nCandidate: So the total fixed costs are Rs.16 crore/MW * 100MW = Rs. 1,600 crore. 1,600 / 473 ~= 3.4, that gives us less than 3-4 years breakeven period.\nInterviewer: How do you plan to finance this?\nCandidate: The investor will invest some money. Rest of it, the wind power company will borrow. Can we assume a Debt-to-Equity ratio of 1:1?\nInterviewer: Government allows a Debt-to-Equity ratio of 4:1 in the wind energy space. You can also depreciate your asset until 20 years. We’d like to make use of this opportunity. Assume debt at 10% interest rate.\nCandidate: So, that gives us depreciation cost of Rs. 1,600 crore / 20 = Rs. 80 crore per year; and interest expense of Rs. 160 crore per year. That leaves us Rs.473 crores – Rs. 80 crore – Rs. 160 crore = Rs.233 crore cash flow at the end of the each year. We should calculate Net Present Value (NPV) of Rs.233 crore cash flow for 20 years @ 10% interest rate.\nInterviewer: Very good. What is the biggest risk you foresee?\nCandidate: Conventional energy sources like thermal power from coal would be cheaper.\nInterviewer: Your line of thinking is right. Rs.6/KWH paid by the government is a subsidized rate. If the government decides to pay lesser, then your entire calculation will go wrong.\nCandidate: Yes, that is correct.\nInterviewer: Thank you, and all the best.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: reduce costs; finance, economics.\nConsulting Firm: Oliver Wyman India Office first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: energy industry.\nCase Interview Question #01012: The client is the owner of a coal-fired power plant located in the city of Mumbai in India. Coal-fired power plants produce electricity usually by burning coal in a boiler to produce steam. The steam produced, under tremendous pressure, flows into a turbine, which spins a generator to create electricity. The steam is then cooled, condensed back into water and returned to the boiler to start the process over.\nThe client is worried about their expenses related to coal. The client has no other power plants or business interests. You have been brought in as a consultant by the owner of the power plant. Explore this issue and suggest some methods to resolve any problems that you may encounter. How can you help the client cut coal related expenses?\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate: Just to clarify, I am to focus only on coal, and not worry about any other costs, revenues or overall profitability. Is that correct?\nInterviewer: Yes.\nCandidate: I’d like to categorize the association of coal by the power plant into 4 stages: Sourcing, Transportation, Use /Processing, and Disposal.\nInterviewer: OK, sounds good to me.\nCandidate: Before I process further, I’d also like to know whether the worry about coal related expenses is unique to our client only, or an industry wide phenomenon.\nInterviewer: It is not unique to our client.\nCandidate: Very well. I’ll start with sourcing then. Can you tell me a bit about how we are currently procuring our coal?\nInterviewer: Our client buys coal from two sources. One is from a state owned monopoly, and the other is from foreign companies. The foreign coal market is like a standard commodity market – quite competitive actually, with companies being price takers. The Indian coal prices are set by the government, and revised periodically.\nCandidate: Could you tell me a bit more about the trends and prices of the two markets?\nInterviewer: The foreign coal market has a broadly increasing trend in terms of prices, although there are a few short term fluctuations. For the Indian state owned monopoly, as I said, the government sets prices and has periodically increased them from time to time.\nCandidate: Are these trends likely to hold in the future as well?\nInterviewer: Yes, you may assume that.\nCandidate: Does the client have a sourcing strategy at present?\nInterviewer: Not really. Coal contracts are set for a given period, and usually the contract is made with the source (foreign or Indian) that is likely to have the lower price in the near future.\nCandidate: It appears that the ideal scenario would be for the client to pay the lower of foreign or government set Indian prices, for every load of coal it buys at all points in time.\nInterviewer: OK. Can you show me on a graph what that might look like?\nCandidate: (Drawing the below graph.)\n\nInterviewer: Right. As you can see that is quite a random pattern. How then do you propose to obtain the minimum price at all times?\nCandidate: I can think of two primary ways of doing it.\nThe first would be through a financial mechanism. The client could buy futures options to purchase coal on the foreign market, and exercise them if it is ordering at a time when the foreign price is lower than the Indian price. Although there would be a price in terms of the cost of the options, I feel that the reduction in uncertainty and the concomitant benefits to planning would make this option worthwhile.\nThe second option would be integrate upstream, by buying coal fields abroad or forming a Joint Venture with a foreign coal company.\nAlthough a deal could be structured to get a supply of coal as and when needed, I would still go with the first option because our client, the power plant is unlikely to have the business expertise to handle running a coal field operation.\nInterviewer: OK, that sounds good.\nCandidate: Would you like me to explore the other parts of the coal supply chain – how the coal is transported, whether the processing of coal can be improved, and issues regarding to by-products or disposal of coal?\nInterviewer: No, I don’t think so. These are quite standardized, and our client has adopted the best practices of the industry. I think that will be all. Thanks.\nCandidate: Thank you.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Sri Lanka has maritime borders with India to the northwest and the Maldives to the southwest. The country has a population of about 20 million people as of 2015.\nWe have a life insurance client in Sri Lanka named Ceylinco Life Insurance. The company has been the No. 1 Life Insurance company in Sri Lanka for 15 consecutive years. Recently, however, their profits have substantially fallen in the last two years.  The client needs our help in finding out why their profits have dropped so much and suggesting possible course of actions to turn around the trend. How would you go about helping the client?\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate: Right. So our objective here is to find out the reason behind the decline in profits? Are there any other objectives that I should be looking at?\nInterviewer: No.\nCandidate: May I please have a minute to think?\nInterviewer: Sure.\nCandidate: There are a couple of things I want to know before proceeding – how is the life insurance industry performing in Sri Lanka? Have profits fallen across firms? Is the market growing?\nInterviewer: No, there are firms where profits have significantly surged. Although I don’t have the exact numbers, the market overall is growing, too.\nCandidate: Could you also tell me about how their competitive position has changed? Have there been new competitors entering the market?\nInterviewer: Yes, they were the largest player in the market, however their position has been slipping and they are now the third largest player, and their profits have fallen substantially in the past 2 years. One new competitor has recently entered the market and not only our client but also other competitors have lost share to him. This competitor has shot to the number one position in a very short time.\nCandidate: Alright. Here it is evident that our competitor is doing something that we are not so I would like to analyse the issue by comparing ourselves with the competition. In order to examine this further, I wish to compare the nature of our product offering, how our product is priced versus others, how we promote it and what our distribution channel is like.\nInterviewer: Sounds good. Is that the 4 P’s that you are using?\nCandidate: Yes, something like that.\nInterviewer: OK. Go on.\nCandidate: Can you tell me a bit more about the kind of life insurance product that they are selling? Are the competitors offering something different?\nInterviewer: So yes, a competitor has recently launched a new type of life insurance product, which gives him an edge over our client. However, that is not an aspect I want you to explore further.\nCandidate: Do we the know something about how our products are priced relative to competitors, do we charge a higher premium?\nInterviewer: They are placed by and large the same, there isn’t much differential there.\nCandidate: Alright. In that case I would want to look at promotion. I am guessing a significant amount of it would be directly through our sales staff. Do we have an idea of how efficient our sales staff is versus the new competitor?\nInterviewer: So actually that is an aspect that we did examine, and as it turned out we learned that our sales staff has much lower turnaround that our competitors. Their ability to both attract and retain new customers is lower. Can you think of reasons for the same?\nCandidate: (Taking time to think) I think the reasons can be threefold: They are less trained than our competitors, their incentive scheme is not strong enough or maybe possibly that we are not just hiring the right people!\nInterviewer: Excellent. Those are the aspects we had looked at. I think we are running behind time, so let us have you head to another interview. Thank you.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Do we have an idea of where the 2018 Cricket World Cup is taking place?\nInterviewer: Yes, in Australia and New Zealand.\nCandidate: Alright. In that case, they should prepare pitches which would replicate conditions there, for instance making them more bouncy. Also these should not only be in the major stadiums but also on the grounds that the young and upcoming Indian players use for practicing.\nThe BCCI can also coordinate with the coaches at the state and the Junior team level and set up a committee which would monitor the progress of certain young players who they think would be in a position to represent the country at an international level by the time the world cup arrives.\nAlso the national team coach should in consultation with past players’ (part of the above mentioned committee) make a list of the strengths and weaknesses of the current team and the kind of players they need to develop. The focus could then be on either developing someone already in the contention for selection or looking for raw talent and then honing it as may be feasible.\nAs part of the Future tours program the BCCI should also try and schedule as many of the coming matches in Australia as possible against the opponents they would be facing in the group rounds of the world cup. This would help us assess our competition.\n(Interviewer nods and indicates that the candidate go on)\nThe national team would also during the course of these matches find out the strengths and weaknesses of these teams in terms of players to watch out for etc.\nThe players who the committee and the coach think are liable to be selected should be given as much exposure in the junior teams against international teams in foreign conditions especially Australia if possible.\nAt this point I was stopped by the interviewer (a partner of the firm), who then proceeded to ask me a number of HR/behavioral & fit questions.\nComment: The candidate could have also looked at the current state of affairs of the team and its performance before making suggestions. That could have given pointers to the weak areas as far team and individual performances are concerned.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Our consulting firm has been hired to advise them on this matter. We have to suggest suitable means for them to adapt to this regulatory change without affecting the client’s bottom-line to a great extent. How would you go about it? What would you recommend?\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate: All right. May I know the exact nature of the client’s business?\nInterviewer: The exact nature of business is not relevant to the case. Like I said, it’s very similar to an insurance company.  Broadly speaking, customers pay a fixed premium to the client firm, and a certain portion of that accrues to the customers for future years; while the company keeps a portion for itself as a fee. \nCandidate: How does the regulatory change affect our client’s business?\nInterviewer: Before the regulatory change, 20% of the premium accrued to the customer, while the company kept 80%. However, the government felt that this was not in the interests of the customers, and it passed legislation as per which 80% would now go to the customers, while the company would get just 20%. This would obviously reduce the profits to a great extent, and we have to suggest means to mitigate the effect of this change.\nCandidate: Ok. Can I have a couple of minutes to gather my thoughts?\nInterviewer: Go ahead. In your suggestions, you should also keep in mind that our client wants to continue in the same business, so all your proposals should be sustainable in the long run.\nCandidate: I would like to start with the basic profit equation: profits = revenues – costs. Net profits are given by contribution per unit multiplied by total volume minus the total fixed costs.\nInterviewer: So what do you infer from that?\nCandidate: As a result of the regulatory change contribution per unit will decrease significantly. To keep the net profit at the same level a possible option could be to increase sales volumes. However in my opinion this would not be practical in the short run as the client company would probably look to reduce its outlay on promotional campaigns and advertisements given the reduced margins.\nInterviewer: Yes, your inference is correct. The number of customers actually went down slightly in the period immediately following the introduction of the legislation.\nCandidate: Then the other option would be to reduce the fixed costs of the company. I would like to know the major cost components for our client. As per my understanding, the relevant cost heads would be employee wages, selling and distribution expenses, rent and administrative costs.\nInterviewer: For our client the significant cost heads were employee salary and rent. How should we go about reducing them?\nCandidate: Could you tell me about the organizational structure of the client? I would also like to know whether the salary paid is a percentage of sales or a fixed amount.\nInterviewer: I am glad you brought this point up. The client company has a very hierarchical structure, with six levels of employees. The salary of the lowest level of employees, the salespersons is on a commission basis, while those at higher levels get a fixed amount every month.\nCandidate: In that case I would recommend restructuring the salary structure by introducing a minimal fixed component and a variable component of pay across all levels. A person’s earnings should be a function of the amount of revenue he generates for the firm, irrespective of his seniority. This would act as an incentive for the company employees and enhance their contribution to the bottom line.\nInterviewer: Interesting. Anything else?\nCandidate: Yes. I would suggest that the company reorganize its organizational structure by reducing the levels of hierarchy. A possible way to do this could be by increasing the scope of responsibility which each employee enjoys. The structure should be as flat as possible, which would significantly reduce the outlay on employees. Furthermore, the client should look to downsize, by letting go of people who are underperforming. A possible means to do so could be eliminate the bottom 10 percent of employees across levels. While downsizing, the company should not reduce the number of salespersons, since they are direct revenue generators. Instead, they should reduce the number of people at the higher tiers.\nInterviewer: Excellent. This is very similar to what we actually advised the client. What do you recommend for reducing the rent expenses?\nCandidate: I would like some information about how the company operates currently and how it solicits customers.\nInterviewer: The company has offices across a number of cities. Salespersons visit potential customers at their homes or offices; some of whom visit the company office and translate into actual clients.\nCandidate: In my opinion, the company could look to reduce the number of offices it has in various cities. A possible solution could be to make use of the Internet and complete the final transactions online. The clients could pay their premiums through an online portal. Moreover, salespersons could solicit sales by contacting people over the telephone or via email. This would reduce the rent and selling expenses both.\nInterviewer: That was a very good analysis. We have run out of time now, but I think you have covered most of the significant points.\nCandidate: Thank you.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Let me take a minute to structure my thought.\nInterviewer: Sure go ahead.\n(After a minute with a structure on the notebook)\nCandidate: As you mentioned, piercings can be of 5 types: ear, nose, tongue, eyebrows and miscellaneous. I would like to deal with each of these one by one.\nInterviewer: Sure. Go ahead.\nCandidate: Let us start with ears. We can divide the customers into two groups: Males and Females. Starting with females, the category can then be divided into age groups 15 years. Each age group can be divided into urban and rural. Does the approach seem correct?\nInterviewer: Yes, I think the approach is correct. However, owing to lack of time, let us skip the differentiation into urban and rural. Can you do some quantitative analysis for me?\nCandidate: Sure. In that case, I will try and estimate the number of people in each age group. Assuming an Indian population of 1 billion and a sex ratio of 1:1 for easier calculations, the number of women in India would be 500 million.\nNow, the life expectancy in India is around 60 years. Although, India is a country where the population is primarily young yet, for the sake of calculations, I am assuming that the number of people in each age group is the same across each age group. Do you think that is an assumption I can make?\nInterviewer: Yes, that is all right.\nCandidate: So, in that case, the number of women in the age group of \nNow, in India, most of the women especially in rural areas get their first ear piercing early in their life. After this, they can get a second or third piercing. Concentrating only on the first piercing for the time being, I would assume that number of women getting their ears pierced in the age group 15 years age group, this number would be negligible. Do you think this is a fair assumption?\nInterviewer: Yes. Good. Please carry on. Estimate the number for any one of the categories.\nCandidate: Sure. Now, obviously, these women would only get their ears pierced once. So, we have to divide the number by 5 which is the length of each age group. Additionally, they would get both their ears pierced. So, we have to multiply the number by 2. Is that fair?\n(Interviewer checks calculations)\nInterviewer: Yes, that is fair. Let us now proceed to general questions now.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Currently headquartered in Lake Forest, Illinois, the Grainger Company is a business-to-business distributor of products used to maintain, repair and operate facilities. Approximately 3 million businesses and institutions worldwide rely on Grainger for products such as fire extinguisher, safety gloves, ladders, motors and janitorial supplies, along with services like inventory management and technical support.\nThe management of W. W. Grainger Inc. is evaluating the industry-wide growth potential for fire safety and protection equipment. They have asked your consulting firm for help. How would you approach the problem? What can the client do to drive growth?\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate: I would need a moment to pen my thought down.\nInterviewer: Please do.\nCandidate: I would first like to look at the market in itself, and examine the growth potential that exists there, also analyzing the existing competition in the market. Then I would like to look at our client’s growth prospects in particular along with the key strengths of the client and how they can be used to grow in the field.\nInterviewer: Sounds good. So what do you think drives growth in the fire safety and protection equipment industry?\nCandidate: First of all I would like to know about the growth rate within the industry.\nInterviewer: It is not very significant. It is close to 2% per annum.\nCandidate: Okay. Now we can look at the nature of competitive forces that exists in the industry. How many key players are there and are we an established player?\nInterviewer: Let’s not look at competition for the moment. Let’s focus more on understanding the industry and what drives growth in the industry.\nCandidate: Ok. So I assume the key streams of revenue would be initial installation and maintenance.\nInterviewer: True. But what drives the demand for the initial installation?\nCandidate: Demand must be driven by the need for safety precautions. In most cases, it might actually be driven by government rules and regulation regarding fire safety norms for buildings.\nInterviewer: Correct! Please continue.\nCandidate: Since mostly commercial clients who purchase fire safety and protection equipment do so for compliance, I would like to approach the problems from two angles. The first would be the growth in the existing customer base and the other would be growth due to change in regulation. Growth in the underlying customer segments would be linked to overall industrial growth.\nInterviewer: Yes. But how do you think you could measure the growth in the industry?\nCandidate: Well, industrial growth in turn could also be measured by the increase in commercial and residential space etc.\nInterviewer: Good. Since growth rate in number of square feet of space is the proxy for demand growth, what would you understand from the following table?\n\n\nMetro\nExpected growth in residential area\nExpected growth in industrial area\nExpected growth in commercial area\n\n\nNew York \n9%\n 12% \n10%\n\n\nLos Angeles\n 10%\n 8%\n 12%\n\n\nChicago \n9% \n15%\n 7%\n\n\nCandidate: We can see that the growth in New York and Chicago would be important to us because we are dealing with industry safety equipment.\nInterviewer: Well, I never said we were dealing with industrial clients. What if we are dealing with fire safety and protection equipment used in commercial areas?\nCandidate: In that case Los Angeles and New York look like interesting questions. But I would like to have some more data on the expected growth in square feet and not just percentages, before I can comment.\nInterviewer: Ok. How will change in regulatory requirements and/or increased compliance affect the industry?\nCandidate: Do you have any data on the current regulatory requirements and how they will change?\nInterviewer: No, But I know that the current ratio of regulators per factories in our target industry is roughly 1:8000, which is expected to remain the same in the future.\nCandidate: Ok. So that means there will not be any significant increase in compliance.\nInterviewer: How do you think can compliance be increased, without increasing manpower?\nCandidate: There can be more frequent checks and stricter penalties for lack of compliance.\nInterviewer: Fine. There are two proposed regulatory changes, one that would impose a high fine on products not complying during an initial check-up during commencement of a facility/space and a second that would increase the frequency of subsequent check-ups. Which has the potential for increasing market growth?\nCandidate: I would go with the latter, as it would automatically enforce initial compliance which the former enforces, and also increase maintenance revenues.\nInterviewer: Thank you. That would be all.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The company is a road and highway developer working in a public-private-partnership (PPP) model. So basically they would get the contract from state or federal government, construct the road and then operate it for some time and hand it over finally to the government.\nThe client Kokosing Construction has good experience in this line of business. With a staff of more than 5,000 employees, the company completes $10 billion of construction projects each year and has a worth of $500 million. Now they have come to us because they want to know what they should do next. They are looking to further grow and diversify their business. How would you go about it?\nPossible Answer:\nNote: The candidate had mentioned his interest in public policy domain during initial phase of behavioral & fit interview. Hence, the case was based on this and insights were expected of him on the case.\nCandidate: OK, before I move on with the recommendations, I would like to know the purpose behind the diversification.\nInterviewer: The client has no specific purpose in mind other than growth into a different area. No specific industry/line of business in mind either. Now how would you go about advising them?\nCandidate: Well, as the client wants to expand into a different business area, I can think of two options: to diversify into a related area or to diversify into a totally new business.\nInterviewer: Where do you think they could go? And which areas?\nCandidate: As they are already into the infrastructure domain, I think they should diversify in the same domain. The government is putting a lot of thrust in the development of infrastructure, so remaining in this sector makes most sense. They can use their experience of working on infrastructure projects to diversify into other related domains.\nInterviewer: So which infrastructure related sector/industry do you think are the best suited?\nCandidate: The most important infrastructure projects going right now are the Dulles Transit Extension, the O’Hare Airport Modernization, and the Crescent Corridor Expansion project. They are already into road construction. Apart from this the other most important ones are real estate / urban development and airport/harbour development. They can look to diversify into these.\nInterviewer: So what all resources do you think will be required for this diversification?\nCandidate: The most important thing would be expertise in the area. We would require industry experts to enter the sector. Financial strength is another aspect. Since we will be working with the government we would also need people who know the right channels and can work with the government on these issues. Issues like raw material, labour, and revenue model would become important as they expand further into the new business. They will also have to look into the regulatory issues before entering a particular sector.\nInterviewer: So of these resources what resources do you think are present with the client and what can be developed in the long run?\nCandidate: I think the financial strength and the raw materials, labour, etc. can be arranged for quickly by the company. These resources will not take much time to develop. The expertise over the field will take longer. In the beginning we might need to hire external experts to get started. Over time we will need to develop in house expertise and also people who can negotiate with the government.\nInterviewer: Sounds good. Thanks and all the best for the next round.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: investment.\nConsulting Firm: McKinsey & Company first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: government, public sector; software, information technology (IT).\nCase Interview Question #00994: West Bengal is a state in eastern India and is the nation’s fourth most populous state, with over 91 million inhabitants. Spread over 34,267 sq mi (88,750 km2), it is bordered by the countries of Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan, and the Indian states of Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar, Sikkim and Assam. The state capital of West Bengal is Kolkata.\nKolkata, formerly known as Calcutta, is located on the east bank of the Hooghly River, and is the principal commercial, cultural, and educational center of East India. Kolkata’s Sector V, located in the Salt Lake area, is a hub for IT and ITES (Information Technology Enterprise Solutions) companies. After the recent change in government, Miss Mamata Banerjee, the Chief Minister of West Bengal since 2011, wants to know whether it is viable or not to build another dedicated IT hub in West Bengal. If it is viable, how should she go about it? How would you go about it?\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate: I would like to discuss some major points regarding the viability of the project. Firstly we have to take into account the revenue sharing and cost sharing model between the government and the private investors. Secondly because of the bad reputation of West Bengal as a place to invest we have to look into the willingness of the investors to actually invest. Thirdly since an IT hub is already present in Kolkata we have to look into the effects the new IT hub will have on that. Also we have to think about the possible location for the new IT hub.\nInterviewer: OK. Let’s start with the revenue sharing and the cost sharing model.\nCandidate: From the knowledge I have West Bengal is actually having a high debt, so it will be difficult for it to allocate a huge sum from the government’s side. But nonetheless because other governments, like say Gujarat, provide a lot of incentives for investors, Miss Banerjee has to ensure that the incentives she provides are also competitive enough.\nInterviewer: That’s a good point.\nCandidate: So after cost I would like to talk about the revenue sharing model.\nInterviewer: Let’s not talk about that for the time being. Assume that Miss Banerjee has made the decision. Now, how would you as a consultant to the government convince the industry to invest in West Bengal?\nCandidate: Ok. For convincing investors I would like to highlight some major points that would show West Bengal as a great place to invest in. I would like to talk about the workforce available in West Bengal, the success of the present IT hub, the low labour cost available to set up.\nInterviewer: What would you say about the workforce and the success of the present IT hub?\nCandidate: West Bengal has few of the great institutions of India. In Engineering, colleges like IIT KGP (Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur), Jadavpur University and many more private colleges are one of the best in India. Thus these colleges provide a big pool of highly skilled workers that the IT industry can use. Also traditionally Bengalis like to stay close to home and hence they would prefer to work in West Bengal itself if given the opportunity. This can further attract skilled workforce from other parts of the country as well.\nAnother point to highlight is the success of the present IT hub in Kolkata. It is expanding at a rapid rate and companies are actually happy with the infrastructure available there.\nInterviewer: Then why would an investor want to invest in a new hub? Why not invest in the present hub itself?\nCandidate: That is because of the lack of space available now. The government is actually not in a position to give space to new companies in the present IT hub and so a new IT hub has to be built.\nInterviewer: So how would you decide on the location for the new IT hub?\nCandidate: Well, there can be 2 approaches. The new IT hub can be placed in the main city as well as in the outskirts of the Kolkata. Both will have its pros and cons. If the new hub is placed in the city it will benefit from the supporting infrastructures like roads and connectivity but the cost of the land might be high. But if an SEZ (Special Economic Zone) is built in the outskirts of the city then the cost of the land will be low but connecting roads and other supporting infrastructure will have to be built. We have to be careful of the land acquisition technique also.\nInterviewer: Well that’s fine. Now assume you are working for Miss Banerjee and I am an investor. Convince me why I should invest in West Bengal.\nCandidate: I would like to start the meeting by highlighting the points that would help your business grow if you invest in our new IT hub. I am sure you must know about the favorable responses that the corporate has given to the present IT hub in Kolkata. They have spoken highly of the infrastructure present there. We plan to provide even better facilities in the new SEZ that we are going to build.\nIn terms of labor availability West Bengal has one of the best skilled workforces in the country due to the presence of great institutes like IIT KGP, Jadavpur University etc. I am sure that you will find the workforce more than enough for your requirements.\nAnother point I would like to stress on is the change in government. Our new government believes only in development and many of the malpractices that came with the communist government like labor unions, bandhs etc will soon be abolished under us. This will ensure smooth business and peace of mind for you as well. We want to change the image of West Bengal and we will make sure that people who help us in the initial stages of this development will be facilitated in the future as well.\nInterviewer: OK, that was a good pitch. That is all for now. Thanks. Please wait for your next round.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: growth; estimate, guesstimate.\nConsulting Firm: Bain & Company first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: electronics.\nCase Interview Question #00995: The client ADT Security Services (NYSE: ADT) is an American corporation that provides residential and small business electronic security systems, fire protection and other related alarm monitoring services in 35 countries. The corporate head office is located in Boca Raton, Florida. ADT is the largest security company in the United States and Canada, serving over 6.5 million customers. As of 2013 ADT holds 25% market share of the residential market and 13% of the small business market in the US.\nADT has been in India for the last 7 years. It installs and maintains electronic security equipment for both residential and business in India. This case concerns ADT’s Indian business only. The company saw a 15%-18% growth in profitability in the first four years after which growth has tapered off to 10% and is still decreasing. The company wants to accelerate its growth and improve its profitability in India. What are your thoughts on it?\nPossible Answer: \nCandidate: Can I take a minute to come up with a structure? \nInterviewer: Sure, go ahead.\nCandidate: Before I start the analysis, I’ll just explain the way I think I’ll go about the analysis. I’ll first want to know more about our client company after which I will analyze the market and competitors. Once I have an idea of the market environment I would like to analyze our customers. With the general scenario in mind, I would like to go on to analyze our revenues and costs and come up with a growth plan.\nInterviewer: That’s a fairly generic analysis but good structure to begin with.\nCandidate: Would you want me to analyze any particular area first or should I go ahead with my plan?\nInterviewer: Go ahead.\nCandidate: What kind of information do I have about our company? What kind of products do we sell and how is our presence?\nInterviewer: We have a pan Indian presence and we primarily sell CCTV cameras.\nCandidate: Do we have any other products?\nInterviewer: No, let us focus on growth in the CCTV segment.\nCandidate: Okay. I’ll go on to get a bit of background about the market for security equipment then. We already know that we’ve witnessed growth in the past few years but it’s slowing down.\nInterviewer: We have a solid product that has a good reputation in the market. However, let’s focus on our consumers first.\nCandidate: Alright. So we have two areas of analysis here. The first being consumer segmentation and second, the value proposition that we have to offer to them. In terms of the value proposition of CCTV cameras, what are we offering?\nInterviewer: What would you offer?\nCandidate: 1. High reliability and service mechanisms, 2. Ease of availability and purchase, and 3. Good delivery mechanisms.\nIn terms of the consumer segments, I think we can divide our consumers into three segments: Public, Corporate and Residential establishments. Does that cover the segments?\nInterviewer: That’s good. We have data that shows that our growth is being pulled down due to the residential segment which has had the slowest growth rate. Why do you think that is happening?\nCandidate: If I were to analyze the growth, I would have to look at two perspectives: growth in sales volumes and growth in revenues. In terms of volumes I would be needed to analyze the number of units sold as installs while revenue analysis would have to consider repair fees and unit process. On a subjective note, there could be several reasons for low growth in the residential market – 1. Awareness about security 2. Need for security and 3. Cost of installation and maintenance.\nInterviewer: Let’s consider the city of Mumbai. What do you think is the market potential?\nCandidate: Well, if I consider the population of Mumbai to be 12 million, each with a family of 4, I have 3 million households. Let’s assume 60% of them live in pucca houses. That comes to about 1.8 million flats at the minimum assuming a single flat for each family.\nAssuming that the number of single houses is less, let’s take that every building has 10 floors with 4 flats on each floor, 1.8 million flats means there are 1.8M / 40 = 45,000 apartment buildings. If each building has say 4 CCTV cameras, it takes us to an approximate figure of 180,000 cameras. We will have to account for existing and new cameras separately to see where our growth plan fits in.\nInterviewer: Great. How do your propose to improve our growth in the residential segment?\nCandidate: We have to pursue two separate strategies for new establishments and old establishments. For old establishments, it makes sense to promote our brand via advertisements that focus on the security aspect. For new establishments we should pursue developers and maintain long term contracts which can be a win-win situation for both us and the developers.\nInterviewers: Do you think advertisements help in this industry?\nCandidate: Well, advertisements are directed at making consumers security conscious. While this is not a direct impact, at the end of the day, the householders have a major say in the decision to install security equipment in apartment buildings.\nInterviewer: Good. One last question then – if you were to train a sales force what measures would you take?\nCandidate: I would decide the team size based on our growth projections. For performance based measures, I would be looking at training in sales methods and an incentive structure that promotes healthy competition.\nInterviewer: I think we have covered quite a few things thoroughly in this case. Good Luck for your next round!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "title": "Telstra Considers Entering Indian Telecom Market",

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: market entry; industry analysis\nConsulting Firm: Deloitte Consulting first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: telecommunications, network.\nCase Interview Question #00996: The client Telstra Corporation Limited (known as Telstra) is Australia’s largest telecommunications and media company which builds and operates telecom networks and markets voice, mobile, internet access, pay television and other entertainment products and services. Telstra’s head office is the office is the Telstra Corporate Centre located in Melbourne, Australia.\nFor this case, our client Telstra wants to enter the Indian telecommunications sector. Let us look at 2 scenarios. The first scenario is that the client wants to enter the Indian telecom market and hasn’t purchased any license yet. The second scenario is that the client already has a 3G license in India. What will be your advice to the client in both the scenarios?\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate: To start with, I would estimate the potential of the telecom market in India. Taking a subjective look, the market currently is huge and the sector is growing rapidly as well. However, there is a lot of competition and a price war is currently ensuing between the incumbents.\nInterviewer: What do you think is the impact of this competition?\nCandidate: Due to the high level of competition, telecom service providers are looking at newer avenues of growth. Many have started expanding to rural areas to drive volumes. Since the rural areas are more sparsely populated, cost of operations in such areas is high. The overall operating expense as percentage of revenues has therefore gone up.\nInterviewer: What could be a critical external factor in this industry?\nCandidate: I think government regulation is the most critical external factor.\nInterviewer: Yes. Regulation is very important. So what is your take on the regulatory environment in India?\nCandidate: The regulations are also not favourable for new entrants. There is no clear direction on the 4G auctions and the mobile number portability will also fuel further competition among incumbents. However, in about 18 months’ time Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) would be making the M&A regulations clearer and hence the client company could consider entering the market through acquisitions (Scenario 1). Once the M&A hurdles are cleared, the valuations of the telecom companies also come down.\nInterviewer: Any other factor that you would like to look at?\nCandidate: Yes, I would also consider the company’s internal capabilities — whether it has any experience in Telecom and in emerging markets, in particular, its historical growth compared to major competitors.\nInterviewer: I think you missed out a key source of revenue. With the emergence of 4G, Value Added Services (VAS) would play a critical role in deciding topline and bottom line growth. How would you factor VAS in?\nCandidate: The company can add value only by leveraging new Value Added Services such as data and focus on acquiring established players who provide VAS.\nInterviewer: Okay, in the second scenario, the client has already bought the license for 3G services in India. How would you go about advising him?\nCandidate: To get a foothold in the Indian telecom market, the operator, apart from setting up networks in the high-revenue and lesser competition areas, should also look at other revenue streams. In future, voice quality will not be a differentiator. The differentiator will be Value Added Services. The company can enter into niche markets such as agricultural yards. Here there is a need for live prices to be updated to farmers and the last mile reach of mobiles can help them in the absence of laptops/desktops or Internet connectivity. Such services will need infrastructure sharing and promote consumer goodwill.\nInterviewer: The company is also about to acquire a 4G license but a large number of people in India cannot afford to buy high end 4G handsets and will continue to use 3G handsets. How can I capture this market?\nCandidate: Another area that the client firm can develop is in the convergence of data on mobile. Currently, there is not much data availability in low-end phones. Applications such as ‘Jaamun’, which converts email to SMS (Short Message Service) and SMS to email, will be extremely successful on low-end phones. These are bottom of the pyramid solutions.\nInterviewer: I think we have discussed a number of major points. Thank you.\nNote: The case involved sector specific knowledge (telecom), coupled with a general understanding of business. The key in such cases is not to know all the facts but to make a logical argument with whatever one knows.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: estimate, guesstimate.\nConsulting Firm: A.T. Kearney first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: oil, gas, petroleum industry.\nCase Interview Question #00997: Natural gas is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture consisting primarily of methane, but commonly including varying amounts of other higher alkanes. Natural gas is a fossil fuel used as a source of energy for heating, cooking, and electricity generation. It is also used as fuel for vehicles and as a chemical feedstock in the manufacture of plastics and other commercially important organic chemicals.\nEstimate the annual demand for natural gas in India.\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate: To estimate the demand, we can look at aggregate per capita energy consumption of the population and look at the share of natural gas in that.\nInterviewer: This approach won’t work. Think about some other approach.\nCandidate: We can focus on the various drivers of natural gas consumption.\nInterviewer: What are they?\nCandidate: The primary drivers are transport, domestic consumption and power generation.\nInterviewer: This approach is fine, but you are missing 2 important industries.\nCandidate: Another important factor is industrial consumption.\nInterviewer: Right and the other important driver for natural gas demand is the feedstock in chemical manufacturing facilities which basically use methane and natural gas as a starting point for some reactions. OK, let’s take transport and estimate the demand from transport.\nCandidate: There are 2 types of transport: personal and public transportation. In personal, I will estimate the distance traveled by a person times the share of natural gas powered vehicles. For public, again I will estimate the total distance covered by public vehicles. I will estimate the share of natural gas powered vehicles and use the number of such vehicles for the calculation of total distance.\nInterviewer: The approach is fine but to get a better clarity, the public transportation can again be split based on vehicle type like buses, rails and autos. Now, let us proceed to power generation, which is a major consumer of natural gas in the country. Estimate the demand there.\nCandidate: What is the total production of power in India?\nInterviewer: 150 gigawatt (GW).\nCandidate: Can I get the share of thermal power production and then the share of natural gas based power production within that?\nInterviewer: The share of natural gas based power plants is 15GW.\nCandidate: What is the amount of natural gas needed to produce 1GW of power?\nInterviewer: You need about 1 billion cubic meters of natural gas per GW.\nCandidate: Total demand will be 15 billion cubic meters.\nInterviewer: This scenario was in 2014. Now estimate the demand in 2016.\nCandidate: Any growth in demand can come from increase in consumption from existing power plants or if any of the existing thermal plants are substituted by natural gas plants.\nInterviewer: New natural gas plants take time to setup. But can you enlist factors that would drive the growth in the number of natural gas plants.\nCandidate:\n1. Better availability of natural gas\n2. Lower fuel (natural gas) cost\n3. Decrease in transportation costs of natural gas\n4. Environmental aspects and laws promoting natural gas\n5. Better availability of plant technology\nInterviewer: Let us concentrate on the first factor. I have another data for you – The current PLF (Plant Load Factor) of natural gas plants is 60%.\nCandidate: What should be the ideal PLF?\nInterviewer: It should be around 90%.\nCandidate: Can I know the reasons for low PLF?\nInterviewer: It was because of minimal availability of fuel.\nCandidate: So, we have supply side constraints. Do we have any data on a possible increase in domestic production of natural gas?\nInterviewer: It could be possible, as Reliance have found natural gas in Krishna-Godavari Basin.\nCandidate: Are there any import restrictions on natural gas?\nInterviewer: There are no restrictions on import, but the infrastructure for this is not adequate.\nCandidate: Is work on building this infrastructure in progress?\nInterviewer: There are a few natural gas terminals under construction.\nCandidate: I guess these will remove the supply side constraints.\nInterviewer: What would be the consumption if the supply side constraints were removed?\nCandidate: Then the PLF will increase from 60% to 90% (1.5 times). Hence the total demand will be 1.5 * 15 = 22.5 billion cubic meters.\nInterviewer: Good. It was an excellent analytical analysis of the case. You also got most of the factors influencing the demand for natural gas right. Thank you!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: investment; finance & economics.\nConsulting Firm: Boston Consulting Group (BCG) first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: utilities; energy industry.\nCase Interview Question #00998: Our client Southern California Edison (or SCE Corp), the largest subsidiary of electric utilities company Edison International (NYSE: EIX), is the primary electricity supply company for much of Southern California, USA. It provides 14 million people with electricity across a service territory  of approximately 50,000 square miles.\nRecently, the client Southern California Edison is looking at an opportunity to invest in the wind energy sector. The specific project is to build a 50MW (megawatt) wind farm in the U.S. state of Oregon. A wind farm or wind park is a group of wind turbines in the same location used to produce electricity. The client Southern California Edison has hired your consulting firm to advise them regarding the feasibility and profitability of this investment opportunity. How would you go about it?\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate: I would try and find out what are the costs that we incur and the benefits that we obtain. Then I would analyze the risks of going into wind energy sector.\nInterviewer: OK, go ahead.\nCandidate: So do you have any details regarding this wind farm project, as in where is it located, what could be the costs to set it up?\nInterviewer: Well, the project is located in the state of Oregon. And regarding the costs, can you enumerate what could be the possible costs and revenues streams of a wind farm?\nCandidate: In order to obtain revenues there are two streams. The first is through the core business, i.e. selling power. We can enter into power purchasing agreements with government (long-term contracts at fixed rates). This will help mitigate a lot of risks and guarantee a fixed cash flow. We could also sell power on the spot market.\nInterviewer: Okay, let us not get into the details of the energy trading market. What else could be a source of revenue?\nCandidate: How about revenues from selling Carbon credits?\nInterviewer: Yes. That is also possible. Continue!\nCandidate: Regarding the costs, they can be classified into two parts – The initial capital expenditure and the operating costs.\nInterviewer: OK. So let’s say that a 50MW wind farm has an installation cost of $1,000/KW, a 50% capacity factor, and operations and maintenance (O&M) expenses of 1 cents/kWh. The debt costs 12% pa (per annum).\nCandidate: And on the revenue side?\nInterviewer: The revenue from power sold is 10 cents/kWh. There is an agreement that ensures whatever you produce will be brought by the government at the agreed upon rate. So, how much do you think the firm should be valued at?\nCandidate: Is there any data given on the terminal value of the project and the duration of the wind farm?\nInterviewer: A lifetime of 20 years and a discount rate of 10% pa can be used. Now can you estimate the cash flow out of the project?\nCandidate: Sure. But I think we are missing a key element here. Taxation is important here as the government gives tax credits on such clean energy projects.\nInterviewer: Good! Let’s assume the government gives no taxation benefits. What then?\nCandidate: Obtained Cash Flows as follows:\nIt is a 50MW wind farm operating at 50% capacity. Hence the KWH generated per hour is 50 * 1,000 (KW per MW) * 50% * 1 hour = 25,000 KWH.\nTotal generation per year is given by 25,000 KWH * 24 (Hours per day) * 300 (Approx. days per year) = 180,000,000 KWH/year.\n\n\nCapacity\n180,000,000 KWH/year\n\n\n\n\nYear 0\nYear 1 to Year 20\n\n\nRevenues (10 cents/kWh)\n0\n$18M\n\n\nOperating Expenses (1 cents/kWh)\n0\n$1.8M\n\n\nCapital Expenses ($1,000/KW)\n$50M\n0\n\n\nInterest (12%)\n0\n$6M\n\n\nCash Flow\n-$50M\n$10.2M\n\n\nDCF (20 years at a 10% discount rate)\n-$50M\n$86.7M\n\n\nNPV\n$36.7M\n\n\n\nInterviewer: Ok. In case the taxation rate is 30% and 100% depreciation is allowed on the capital expenditure. What is the value of the tax shield?\nCandidate: In that case, the tax shield is D*T*I = $50,000,000 * 0.3 * 1 = $15,000,000.\nInterviewer: Ok. So what would be the approximate payback period of the project?\nCandidate: It looks like we will have a payback period of about 6-7 years.\nInterviewer: Who would be interested in such investments?\nCandidate: I think a PE firm would not be interested in such an investment because they look at much higher rates of return with a payback period of 5-8 years. This investment wouldn’t fit into their profile so they would rather put their money elsewhere.\nInterviewer: Who do you think will be interested in such an investment opportunity? Mutual Funds?\nCandidate: Companies like pension funds and insurance firms with steady source of income requirement might be interested in such an investment.\nInterviewer: Ok. Our time is running short here. What do you think are the risks that the client company is exposed to? Just enumerate them.\nCandidate: Ok. There is the risk that the cost of technology increases or the cost of operations increases. There can also be risks due to delay in approvals and such administrative hurdles. There is also a risk that the government might bring about unexpected policy changes.\nInterviewer: Ok. Thank you.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The company is a major retailer of clothing and household products in the United States, with its headquarters located in Framingham, Massachusetts.\nMarshalls has experienced tremendous growth from 1980s to early 2000s. Recently, however, is has been experiencing sluggish growth and less than expected profits in the last few years. The CEO has hired your consulting team to help her increase the company’s annual growth rate and ultimately its profitability. What would you recommend the CEO of Marshalls do?\nAdditional Information:\n• The client Marshalls has 50 stores located in shopping malls in metropolitan and suburban areas.\n• Total revenue from the 50 stores has declined, despite major back-end cost savings.\nPossible Solution:\n1. High Level Plan of Attack\n• You need to understand why growth has slowed and profitability has declined despite cost savings.\n• Do different stores experience variations in revenue? Do they all have the same approach to selling?\n• Is purchasing behavior of the consumer different in the two areas?\n• Has there been any new competition on the scene? In one area and not the other?\n2. Lay Out Your Thoughts\nConsider using the profitability framework: Profits = Revenue – Cost = (Volume * Price) – (Fixed cost + Variable Cost)\n• The case tells you that cost savings have been achieved. Focus on the revenue side.\n• Focus on the fact that the company has 50 different stores, in two different geographical areas: metropolitan and suburban areas. What are the key differences between the two in terms of the consumer, competition, and growth?\n3. Dig Deeper: Gather Facts\nCandidate: Are some stores more profitable than others?\nInterviewer: Yes, they are. We see variations throughout.\nCandidate: Are there differences in profitability between the metropolitan and suburban stores?\nInterviewer: Yes there are. We see that the suburban stores are more profitable than the urban ones.\nCandidate: Is there more competition in the urban areas?\nInterviewer: No, not really. It’s proportionally the same.\nCandidate: Do the stores sell the same products?\nInterviewer: Yes they do. All stores have the same product mix.\nNote to Candidate: Given that all stores sell the same product mix and some are more profitable than others, this should lead you to look at consumer behavior.\nCandidate: Do consumers in the suburban areas have different purchasing behavior than the urban dwellers?\nInterviewer: Yes, as a matter of fact, they do. The suburban customer tends to buy more of the major appliances and electronic equipment than the urban consumer. The urban consumer buys mostly items such as clothing, small furniture items, and small appliances.\nNote to Candidate: You can make the assumption that suburban consumers have higher incomes and are in more need of major appliances given the difference in living quarters between houses versus apartments in the city.\nCandidate: Is there a difference in profitability between the goods purchased by the suburban and urban consumers?\nInterviewer: Yes. Major appliances and TVs and stereos are higher profit items than clothing and minor appliances.\nCandidate: Would you say that the current product mix is more suited for the suburban customer than for the urban?\nInterviewer: Yes. I guess it is.\n4. Key Findings\n• The consumer in the city has different needs and purchasing behavior than the suburban consumer. The stores in the city are not catering to the demographics of its surroundings.\n• Unnecessary costs are being incurred through inventory and lost floor space in the city stores, resulting in lost revenue for the retailer.\n5. Recommendations\n• Further analyze the customer for each of the stores and differentiate purchasing behavior and income levels.\n• Cater the product mix according to the customer research findings.\n• Stores that cannot sustain selling low cost items should consider the possibility of closure.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

You’ve just called in to confirm your start time on your first day and find out you have an excellent opportunity to be the lead business strategist on a high profile project.\nWe have partnered with The Children’s Place (NASDAQ: PLCE), a leading bricks-and-mortar children’s apparel retailer to help them analyze, design, and build their Internet and e-commerce strategy. The Children’s Place (TCP) is a Secaucus, New Jersey-based specialty retailer of children’s apparel and accessories. The company also markets apparel under the The Children’s Place, Place, and Baby Place brand names.\nThere will be a kick-off meeting for the project with the client TCP (including the client’s CEO) on Monday morning. The Principal/Engagement Leader on this project has asked you to lead a discussion about how the client should think about opportunities on the Internet. Right now, the client only has a marketing and informational presence on the web (a.k.a. “brochureware”). The Principal/Engagement Leader wants the client to think about the range of opportunities and challenges the Internet presents and whether the client should invest aggressively in pursuing any initiatives.\nAdditional Information:\nThe client TCP’s web site and some associated articles found on the Internet have provided the following information.\n• The client TCP is a publicly traded company (NASDAQ: PLCE) with a $3B market cap. The share price has risen from $15 to $45 in the past 12 months.\n• The client TCP has 300 stores, mostly east of the Mississippi, and all stores are within the U.S.\n• Revenues are approximately $250M, and the firm has average profitability for its industry.\n• The client has been on a rapid store expansion program adding about 25 new stores each quarter for the past two years. They claim to expect similar growth going forward.\n• The market for the client is clothing for children 12 and under. Sales are roughly split between boys and girls.\n• The company is vertically integrated: It designs all its own products, has deep relationships with contract manufacturers in Asia, and distributes all of its products through company owned stores.\n• The company sells a high quality product that is priced about 25-30% lower than its chief competitors.\n• The company has done only limited marketing. The brand remains relatively unknown.\nPossible Answer:\nPart #1. Qualitative Analysis\nPlan for the client meeting. Structure the problem at hand. What questions would you ask? Then, work with your interviewer to explore and broaden those questions and brainstorm the client’s hypothetical responses.\nPossible Solution:\nTo present the best solution, the candidate must have a better understanding of the customers, the competitors and the client. Some of the important questions to ask are:\na. Market and Competitive Landscape\n• What are the main trends and dynamics going on in the client’s industry?\n• What are their competitors doing?\n• Who are they?\n• What are the brick-and-mortar children’s apparel retailers doing?\n• How are they using the Internet: Has there been a direct causal relationship to their revenues and/or expenses from their Internet strategy and implementation?\n• What are the Internet pure play apparel retailers doing?\n• Who could some of the oblique or peripheral competitors be?\n• Would they be likely to enter the market?\nb. Customers\n• Who are the client’s customers?\n• What is the value proposition to the client?\n• What are the trends in the customer base over time?\nc. Client\n• What are the client’s goals?\n• To increase revenues? To reduce costs? To increase market capitalization?\n• How could different Internet initiatives accomplish each of these goals?\nPart #2. Quantitative Analysis\nAfter spending part of the weekend preparing for your kick-off meeting and discussion facilitation, you check your voice-mail from the airport before hopping onto the shuttle on your way to the client’s office for the meeting. The one new message is from your Principal/Engagement Leader asking you to provide an estimate of the size of today’s online component of domestic children’s apparel sales and how large it might grow in the next 5 years. As you step onto the plane, you realize that you’ll have no access to the Internet or other research before the meeting starts. Instead, you will need to create a “back-of-the-envelope” analysis on the plane.\nSpend about 5 minutes creating an answer to these two questions:\n• What would you estimate the size of today’s online component of domestic children’s apparel sales today?\n• How large do you think it will grow in the next 5 years?\nPossible Solution:\nAssume the children’s apparel category is dollars spent on clothes for kids ages 12 and under, as stated in the case facts. There are approximately 300 Million people in the U.S., perhaps 15% are under 12:\n• 300M * 15% = approximately 45M kids under the age of 12.\nAssume the average parents spend $250 on each kid age 12 or under each year.\n• 45M kids * $250/year = $11B/year children’s apparel industry for kids 12 and under.\nOf the people who spend this $11B, assume 50% of them have Internet access and have the potential to shop online. Therefore, the theoretical current maximum potential size of the market is:\n• $11B * 50% = $5.5B\nHowever, just because people use their online access to buy their kids’ clothes doesn’t mean they spent all $250 for each child online for their apparel. In fact, only a small fraction of those dollars are spent online today, perhaps 5% (a.k.a. share of wallet).\n• $5.5B * 5% = $275M\nIn the next five years, let’s assume the number of kids increases to 50M, average spending goes to $300 per kid age 12 and under, Internet access rises to 60% and share of wallet rises to 20%. The 5-year growth estimate would be:\n• 50M kids * $300/kid * 60% * 20% = $1.8B \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The company is a major manufacturer of regional airplanes – airplanes with 100 seats or less. Its business consists of two types of aircraft: (1) jet engine, 80 to 100-seat aircraft and (2) propeller, 20 to 30-seat aircraft.\nIn fiscal year 2013, Bombardier delivered 100 jet engine aircraft and 150 propeller. This represented a unit volume increase year-over-year of 10% and 5%, respectively, and revenues of USD $730 million and $225 million, respectively.\nAlthough overall profitability for Bombardier in 2013 was a competitive 5% economic profit margin, profitability varied significantly by business. The propeller aircraft business generated a stellar 30% profit margin, while the jet engine business was unprofitable with a margin of -3%. Over the past several years, Bombardier has experienced eroding profitability in its jet engine aircraft business. Its propeller business, despite being profitable, has been flat in most recent years.\nAt a January 5th analyst conference (a meeting with the investor community) Bombardier’s senior management team announced that the company was committed to managing for value. To this end, Bombardier has hired you and a team of McKinsey consultants to help the company develop and implement the value-maximizing strategies for its businesses.\nFor our case discussion today, please focus on the jet engine aircraft business only:\n(1) How would you go about further analyzing this business?\n(2) What recommendations would you like to make to senior management of Bombardier?\nAdditional Information: \nPlease see handouts #1, #2, & #3 below.\nExhibit 1.

Case Summary\nBombardier Aerospace is losing money in one of its two business units: jet engine aircraft. However, the market for jet engine aircraft is profitable. Although Bombardier has a parity offering and operating position, it has a disadvantaged overall competitive position, driven by a pricing disadvantage in serving its large lessor customer segment. Lessors, in purchasing large volumes of aircraft, have been able to exert significant buying power over our client to achieve large price concessions.\n2. Market Economics\nAn “A” candidate should seek to understand market size, growth and profitability, as well as conduct an indirect structural assessment of the industry, e.g., suppliers, customers.\nAdditional Information: to be provided to candidate if asked, although some may require prompting.\n• Market Size: In 2013, the U.S. jet engine, 100 seat or less aircraft market was ~$5 billion.\n• Competitors: There is no dominant competitor in the jet engine, 100 seat or less market. The market leader Boeing has 20% market share. There are 4 other competitors with market share from 12% to 18%. Bombardier has ~16% share.\n• Market Growth: The market has been growing 5% (in units delivered) each year for the past 5 years and is expected to continue to grow 5% over the next decade. In 2013, a total of 625 jet engine regional aircraft were delivered to customers.\n• Market Profitability: Ask the candidate whether he/she thinks the market is profitable, and how he/she would go about assessing market profitability. (Answer to be provided post discussion on structural forces below — The market is profitable with the average competitor generating 4% economic profit margins over the past 5 years).\n• Supplier Power: The supplier base for regional aircraft parts is highly fragmented and Bombardier uses approximately 50% proprietary parts in its jet engine aircraft. Hence, supplier power is low.\n• Intensity of Competition: (Direct) Fairly concentrated market with only 6 jet engine regional aircraft manufacturers. Hence, intensity of direct competition is low-to-moderate.\n• Customer Power: In 2013, there were 225 customers. Types of customers include airlines, aircraft lessors, local and national governments, businesses and private individuals. Hence, customer power varies by segment.\nNote: Only if the candidate asks about customer power, share with him/her the following facts:\nAircraft lessors make large purchases (often 20 or more aircraft) during a buying cycle and hence exploit their negotiating leverage over manufacturers, such as Bombardier. Hence, aircraft lessors have high customer power. All other customers have low-to-moderate buying power, depending on their credit worthiness.\n• Intensity of Competition: (Indirect) Larger commercial jets (100 seats or greater) with longer range manufactured by large commercial aerospace and aircraft manufacturers can be used on regional routes. However, these larger aircraft are expensive for customers to operate solely on a regional basis. Hence, intensity of indirect competition is low.\n• Barriers to Entry: Jet engine, regional aircraft manufacturing requires significant capital investment in production facilities and equipment, as well as strong relationships with various labor unions. Hence, barriers to entry are high.\n3. Competitive Position\nAn “A” candidate should seek to understand competitors and Bombardier’s offering, pricing, and operating position.\nAdditional Information: to be provided to candidate if asked, although some may require prompting.\n• Offering position: Overall, the client company’s offering position is at parity.\n• Commonality: The company’s jet engine aircraft has a cockpit that is similar to the industry standard and results in low switching costs for new customers (pilots and flight crew do not need extensive re-training).\n• Performance: The company’s aircraft offers a range of 500 miles, which is similar to the market average.\n• Maintenance and Asset Life: The majority of the fragmented jet engine aircraft maintenance companies have the capabilities and parts to service Bombardier’s aircraft. For the aircraft customer, maintenance costs over the life of the asset is in line with regional jets of the company’s competitors. On average, the life of the aircraft is 20 years.\n• Pricing Position:\nQuestion for the candidate: Based on the discussion thus far, what do you think that the client company’s pricing position is relative to competitors?\nPossible Answer: Bombardier is pricing below the market average, since it is gaining market share (unit volume is growing at 10% vs. market growth of 5%) with a parity offering. Hence, Bombardier is pricing for share, i.e., in FY 2013 it had a disadvantaged pricing position.\n• Operating Position: Bombardier’s operating cost per aircraft is at parity with the industry. Every jet engine aircraft\nthe company delivered in 2013 cost approximately the same to produce.\nNote: The candidate should recognize that achieving scale is critical to the spreading of fixed costs, and hence, the lowering of per unit costs.\n4. Bombardiers Customers\nCustomer Segments: Bombardier serves 3 types of jet engine aircraft customers:\n• Customers who purchase only 1 aircraft in a buying cycle (approximately every 5 to 15 years, depending on the customer)\n• Customers who purchase 3 aircraft, and\n• Customers who purchase 20 aircraft\nAt this juncture, the candidate should inquire about customer segment profitability. Provide the candidate with the\nhandout: “Exhibit 3. Jet Engine Regional Aircraft Business – Profitability by Customer Segments”.\nDescription of customer segments:\n• Customers who buy only 1 aircraft during a buying cycle are comprised mostly of small aircraft customers with moderate-to-high credit risk.\n• Customers who buy 3 aircraft are comprised mostly of medium aircraft customers with moderate credit risk.\n• Customers who buy 20 aircraft are comprised of creditworthy aircraft lessors.\nKey Driver of Segment Profitability:\nIf the candidate has not discussed it already, at this point in the case, he/she should recognize that the 3 aircraft lessors in making large purchases during a buying cycle exploit their negotiating leverage over Bombardier.\nThe data to support this can be quickly calculated by the candidate by referencing the “Profitability by Customer Segment” handout:\n• $408M/60 aircraft = $6.8M average sales dollars per aircraft from aircraft lessors, compared to\n• $42M/5 aircraft = $8.4M from small aircraft customers,\n• $280M/35 = $8.0M from medium aircraft customers.\nNote: Ask the candidate to compute average price by customer segment, if he/she has not done so without being prompted.\nOf course, the candidate should be able to conclude that the main driver of profitability between customer segments is solely price without doing any math, since operating cost per aircraft produced and delivered is the same regardless of the intended customer.\n5. Overall Competitive Position\nQuestion for the candidate: Do you think that the client company’s overall competitive position is advantaged, disadvantaged or at parity?\nPossible Answer:\nBombardier is competitively disadvantaged overall with negative profits (compared to a profitable market) driven by a disadvantaged pricing position, particularly to the large lessor customer segment.\n6. Strategy Alternative\nKey Question: What are some strategy alternatives that Bombardier can pursue in order to improve its jet engine aircraft profitability?\nPotential alternative #1: Aggressively pursue new small and medium, non-aircraft lessor customers and do not increase sales to existing aircraft lessor customers.\nAsk the candidate what key questions he/she would seek to answer in the evaluation of this alternative. Key risks may include a slow road to profitability and unlikely to result in the doubling of the jet engine aircraft business’ value. Ask the candidate to compute how long it would take for Bombardier to double the economic profit of the business given the company acquires new small and medium, non aircraft lessor customers at the market growth rate of 5%.\nPotential alternative #2: Aggressively pursue new small and medium, non-aircraft lessor customers and do not serve any aircraft lessors.\nAsk the candidate what key questions he/she would seek to answer in the evaluation of this alternative. Key risk may include the inability to achieve scale (currently at 100 units, with 60% of units purchased by aircraft lessors), and hence, profitability in any customer segment.\nPotential alternative #3: Bombardier to increase its negotiating leverage vis-a-vis aircraft lessors by entering the aircraft leasing market.\nAsk the candidate what key questions he/she would seek to answer in the evaluation of this alternative.\nSome additional facts to share with the candidate:\n• The jet engine, regional aircraft leasing market is large and growing. In 2013, the new aircraft leasing market represented almost 50% of all new aircraft delivered (with operating leases comprising half) and is expected to grow 5% per year.\n• The aircraft leasing market is profitable with the average competitor generating ROEs of ~15% (cost of equity ~10%).\n• Three aircraft lessors (also Bombardier’s customers) dominate the market with a combined share of 65%.\n• The key driver of profitability is cost of funds.\n• Bombardier currently provides vendor- or manufacturer-financing on a very limited basis in the form of leases.\n• Bombardier would be at parity in terms of cost of funds.\n• Bombardier has marketing relationships with all aircraft end-users who are leasing their aircraft from the company’s aircraft lessor customers. Bombardier works with these end-users to help them configure the plane during the front end of the sales process.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "url": "http://www.consultingcase101.com/parker-pen-company-to-move-production-to-low-wage-country/",
        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: increase sales; reduce costs; new product.\nConsulting Firm: PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Advisory first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: consumer products; manufacturing.\nCase Interview Question #00987: The client Parker Pen Company is a global leading manufacturer of writing products, with divisions in North America, Europe and South-East Asia. The company’s corporate headquarters are located in Newhaven, East Sussex, England. Parker Pen Company’s global sales equals €100 million whereas its profit amounts to €50 million.\nThe major activities of Parker Pen Company’s European division are within the manufacturing and sales of disposable pens. Within the European region, the client’s sales are flattening and profit is decreasing. Parker Pen Company’s CEO has asked your consulting firm to determine the cause of the decreasing profit in the European pen division, and to come forward with suggestions to bring it back up. How would you go about it? What recommendations would you make to the CEO?\nPossible Answer:\n1. High level plan of attack \nFirst, discuss the major aspects you would like to study in order to understand the decrease in profit.\nNote: In a case interview, this step is crucial. Verify whether you understood the objective of the case and write down the main question. During the interview, take the time to determine your structure and make sure to communicate your plan clearly.\n2. Suggested Framework\nConsider using the profitability framework: Profits = Revenue – Cost = (Volume * Price) – (Fixed cost + Variable Cost)\nProfit is defined by sales minus costs. Parker Pen Company’s decreasing profit within the European pen division is caused by flattening sales on one hand, and this could be accumulated by increasing costs on the other.\na. Possible causes for flattening sales:\n• The number of pens sold is decreasing\n• The price per pen is decreasing\n• An unfavorable shift is taking place within the product mix\nb. Possible causes for increasing costs:\n• Increasing direct costs\n• Material costs\n• Direct wages\nc. Increasing indirect costs:\n• Production costs\n• Transportation costs\n• Indirect wages\n• Marketing & Sales costs\n• Overhead costs\nExcellent additional remark\nWithin the cost-price of a pen, the share of indirect costs is substantial. For a great part, these indirect costs are determined by the utilization of the production capacity. When production utilization increases, the indirect costs can be distributed over a greater number of products, such that the costs per product diminishes. Therefore, we should test the hypothesis that utilization of the production capacity could be increased.\n3. Detailed Analysis\nPart #1: Study the means to increase sales in further detail\nInterviewer: Before looking into possibilities of reducing costs, let’s first study the opportunities on the sales side a little more.\nNote: In a case interview, if you think you need more information, do not hesitate to ask for it. However, make sure you are asking for a specific answer. For example: “Would you want me to look at the sales of pens or would you also be interested in sales of other writing products?” The answer in this case is: “We are only interested in the sales of various kinds of pens”.\nIn order to provide a delicate answer to the question, the candidate could request the following information:\n• What are the segments in which Parker Pen Company is operational?\n• How aggressive is the competition within these segments?\n• What is the current stage of the pen market?\nPossible Answer:\nI would like to identify a few possible means to increase sales:\n• Increase sales to existing customers: for example, attach sales of accessories or fillings to pen sales.\n• Initiate sales to new customers: for example by increasing the number of distribution channels and/or intensifying marketing.\n• Selectively increase the prices.\n• Launch new products: for example, premium pens.\n• Get rid of unprofitable pens within the existing product mix, such that sales will shift from unprofitable pens towards more profitable pens.\n• Cut a deal with retailers: for example, attach a pen to a specific notebook within their assortment.\nExcellent additional remark:\nThe pen market is highly competitive, especially within the segment of disposable pens in which Parker Pen Company is operational. Therefore, to Parker Pen Company price is extremely important. This makes the sales increase by means of an increase in prices fairly unrealistic. If we would have been looking at premium products (i.e., products with added value which customers are willing to pay for), price would be of minor importance.\nPart #2: Study the launch of new products in order to increase sales in further detail\nInterviewer: There seem to be opportunities within the market of premium pens. In this example, we will assume fountain-pens which are produced in vast volumes, with minimum selling price €10. The client Parker Pen Company does not yet operate within this segment. Let’s look into this in some further detail.\nI. Estimate the market for premium pens in Europe\nThis means: Provide an estimate of the number of premium pens sold per annum within Europe – Be prepared to be solving mathematical problems during the case. It is expected that you will do calculations without the use of a calculator. In client situations, there will often not be a calculator either. Make assumptions and round numbers such that multiplying and dividing is easier. Also, make sure to perform a sanity check after deriving an answer.\nSuggested Answer:\nI will start with some assumptions, and then calculate the estimated number of premium pens sold per annum within Europe:\n• The number of inhabitants of Europe is 750 million\n• Persons below the age of 12 do not possess premium pens\n• This category represents about 15% of the European population (12/80 ≈ 15%)\n• On average, 1 out of 4 persons possesses a premium pen\n• On average, a premium pen is utilized over a period of 5 years\nOver a period of 5 years, the number of premium pens sold in Europe is:\n750 million * (100% – 15%) * 1/4 pens = 160 million premium pens.\nThis corresponds to a market of 180 million pens over 5 years, or 180M/5 years = 36 million pens per annum. Let’s assume the total market of premium pens within Europe equals 30 million pens. We round down because the assumed average of 1 out of 4 persons in Europe possessing a premium pen seems a bit high.\nII. Consider entry barriers for Parker Pen Company\nInterviewer: As Parker Pen Company is not yet operational within the premium pen segment, Parker Pen Company will have to enter this market as a new player. In order to determine whether launching premium pens is a successful strategy, we first have to consider the barriers to entry.\nSuggested Answer:\nThere are a few considerations regarding barriers to entry.\n• Access to distribution channels\nParker Pen Company holds a distribution network for the current assortment. However, in addition to these channels, premium pens are sold through distribution channels Parker Pen Company does not yet have access to, such as specialty stores. Therefore, the client Parker Pen Company will need to invest in these distribution channels.\n• Market consolidation in the segment of premium pens\nThe size of the market for premium pens is relatively small and highly consolidated by established strong brand names, such as Waterman, Mont Blanc, Cartier and Dunhill. A successful launch of a new premium brand name seems impossible unless great risks are taken by mayor investments in marketing and sales.\n• Access to resources\nParker Pen Company is a global leading company, such that access to resources is not expected to be a problem.\n• Image / reputation of the brand “Parker Pen Company”\nThe main obstacle for Parker Pen Company is the image it has a manufacturer of disposable pens. This existing image makes it\nextremely difficult to position itself within the market of premium pens.\nIn conclusion, it is difficult for Parker Pen Company to launch premium pens because the market seems consolidated and dominated by strong brand names.\nIII. Consider the financial attractiveness of entering the market\nInterviewer: As a consultant, it is important to support the advice you deliver by analyses. From the previous answers, it became clear that launching premium pens is difficult for the client, but it could still be profitable. Would you advice the client to extend the assortment with premium pens?\nSuggested Answer:\nIn order to derive a conclusion on the financial attractiveness of entering the market of premium pens, I will estimate Parker Pen Company’s possible market share, its corresponding sales and the resulting profit within premium pens:\n• Parker Pen Company’s market share within premium pens\n- Assume the strong brand names cover a consolidated market share of 80%\n- Assume Parker Pen Company would indeed be able to position itself and capture a 2% market share\n• Parker Pen Company’s sales in premium pen\n- With its 2% market share and a market size of 30 million pens per year, Parker Pen Company could sell 600,000 pens a year.\n- With an assumed average selling price of €20/pen, this results in €12 million sales.\n• Parker Pen Company’s profit in premium pens\n- The reason people are willing to pay more for premium pens, is the added value of a special design or a brand name. Premium products usually have a gross profit margin of over 25% (this is the difference between the sales and fixed and variable production costs).\n- The costs of premium pens are mainly determined by the marketing and sales of the product, instead of the manufacturing. Parker Pen Company will need to incur major marketing & sales expenses in order to gain market share. Assuming the profit margin after the marketing & sales expenses to be about 5% results in €600,000 annual profit. Compared to their €50 million total profit, this is extremely small (~1.2%).\nIn conclusion, launching premium pens is financially not attractive. It seems sensible to study further other possibilities\nfor increasing the sales, or look into the possible means of reducing the costs.\nPart #3: Study the means to decrease costs in further detail\nInterviewer: In order to resolve Parker Pen Company’s main problem – that is, its decrease in profit – in the beginning we concluded that there are two sub problems we need to analyze. Increasing sales, reducing the costs. In the previous analysis, we looked into the optimization of sales. We would now like to proceed and question whether we could realize a cost reduction.\nSuggested Answer:\nI will first create a cost breakdown, and then discuss the possible means to decrease those costs.\nParker Pen Company’s main costs:\n• Direct costs\n- Material costs (both for the pens and packaging)\n- Direct wages (wages of e.g. temporary employees)\n• Indirect costs\n- Production costs (machinery, buildings, maintenance of production lines)\n- Transportation costs (both inbound and outbound)\n- Indirect wages (supervision, administration)\n- Marketing & Sales costs\n- Overhead costs\nPossible means to decrease costs:\n• Reduce material costs\n- Use economies of scale\n- Purchase in low-wage country such as China\n- Use cheaper material for e.g. packaging\n- Rationalize the product / packaging design\n- Reduce the complexity of products\n• Reduce wages\n- Make use of wage differences among varying groups of employees more efficiently (replace temporary employees by contracted employees, use skilled persons only where necessary)\n- Move production process to low-wage country\n• Reorganize the production\n- Consolidate factories\n- Move production process to low-wage country\n- Computerize parts of the production process\n• Reduce transportation, Marketing & Sales and Overhead costs\n- Increase efficiency\n- Make use of wage differences among varying groups of employees more efficiently\n- Move production process to low-wage country\nPart #4: Study the move to low-wage countries in order to reduce costs in further detail\nInterviewer: What will be the cost reduction when moving the production process to China?\nSuggested Answer:\nFirst, I will assume a cost structure, followed by an assumption on the incorporated differences when moving to China. Next, I will use these assumptions to discuss the impact of moving to China.\nI assume the following cost structure: (This table could be created with the help of the interviewer)\n• Indirect Costs\n- Production costs = 20%\n- Transportation costs = 5%\n- Indirect wages, marketing & sales, overhead costs = 5%\n• Direct Costs\n- Material costs = 50%\n- Direct wages = 20%\nI assume wages in China are about 20% of the wages in Europe.\nThe resulting impact of moving production to China is as follows:\n• Impact on wages\n- The costs per pen attributable to direct wages will decrease by 20% * 80% = 16%\n- A decrease in indirect wages will imply an additional cost reduction\n• Further impact\n- Reduction in costs could be obtained by the local purchase of materials.\n- Consolidate factories and better utilize production capacity. This will imply a decrease in production costs, resulting in a smaller amount of indirect costs per product and an increasing profit margin.\n- A disadvantage is the increase in costs due to increasing distribution costs.\nIt will be necessary to further investigate whether the cost reductions above offset the increase in distribution costs.\n4. Recommendation\nThe goal of the client was to improve the financial performance of the European pen division. The main aspects we investigated are possibilities for an increase in sales and a decrease in costs. A mayor opportunity to reduce costs is to move the production process to a low-wage country such as China – this needs to be investigated further.\nI. Possible means to increase sales\n• Price optimization seems impossible\n- The pen market is highly competitive. Especially in the disposable pens’ segment, price is extremely important.\n• Launch of premium pens seems not worth the effort\n- We studied the possibilities to broaden the Parker Pen Company’s product portfolio by the launch of premium pens. It appeared not to be sensible to enter the market of premium pens, as the market seems consolidated and dominated by strong brand names.\n• Other means of increasing sales need further investigation\n- Existing customers: for example, attach sales of accessories or fillings to pen sales\n- New customers: for example by increasing the number of distribution channels and/or intensifying marketing\n- Launch new products\n- Get rid of unprofitable pens within the existing product mix\nII. Possible means to decrease costs\n• Move production process to a low-wage country such as China captures opportunities\n- With wages 5 times lower than in Europe, at least 16% of the product costs can be saved.\n- Moreover, further reduction in costs could be obtained by the local purchase of materials.\n• Other means of decreasing costs need further investigation\n- Use economies of scale\n- Consolidate factories.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new business; market sizing.\nConsulting Firm: Samsung Global Strategy Group (GSG) 2nd round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: Telecommunications, Network.\nCase Interview Question #00989: Our client Dish Network LLC (NASDAQ: DISH) is an American direct broadcast satellite TV (DBSTV) service provider. The company provides satellite TV, audio programming, and interactive television services to commercial and residential customers in the United States. Headquartered in Meridian, Colorado, Dish Network provided services to 13.9 million TV subscribers as of April 2016.\nThe client Dish Network is facing increased pressure on its customer base from telecommunication and cable companies such as AT&T, Comcast and Time Warner Cable offering “triple play” bundles of TV, internet, and phone services. The management of Dish Network is considering deploying WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access, a family of wireless communications standards) wireless networks across the USA to offer its customers broadband Internet (and potentially phone service – VoIP). Should the client enter into the WiMAX business?\nAdditional Information: to be given to candidate upon request \nExhibit 1. How WiMax works\n\n• Offering triple play (bundles of TV, Internet, phone services) will allow the client to compete with telecommunication and cable companies.\n• Deploying WiMAX is extremely expensive, driven by:\n- Spectrum costs: acquiring frequencies from the federal government\n- Base stations: tower that send/receive wireless signal (similar to cellular)\n- CPE: customer premise equipment\n- Additional SG&A\n• Revenue upside consists of 6M subscribers in the USA (based on management estimates of 5% market share) paying $20/month.\n• Total investment $2.6B; potential revenue upside: $1.44B; since most costs are variable (per customer) could not break even in year 1.\n• Client should focus on defending its core market of satellite TV.\nMarket share (management estimate) = 5%\nBase station bandwidth = 80,000 kbps\nBandwidth require per household = 320 kbps\n% of concurrent connections * = 50%\nBroadband Internet service price = $20 per month\n* Telecommunication companies balance the cost per subscriber and required bandwidth per sub by estimating the % of subs who are online at any point in time.\nPossible Solution:\n1. Frame the Problem\na. Costs\n• Capital expenditures\n- Base stations (towers)\n- Getting the licenses\n- Additional equipment\n• Operational excellence/ongoing costs\n- Maintenance\n- Leases etc.\n• SG&A\n- Additional sales and marketing efforts\nb. Potential Revenues\n• Market share\n- How big is the market?\n- What is a reasonable market share assumption?\n• Pricing\n- Market price for broadband services?\n- How price sensitive are consumers?\nc. Key issues/challenges\n• Buy vs. build?\n• Competitive moves?\n• Regulatory issues?\n2. Detailed Analysis\nTotal Cost = (1) Network cost + (2) SG&A\n(1) Network cost\na. Spectrum\n• How much would the spectrum (license) be?\n– What can historical data tell us?\nb. Base Stations\n• Should we buy or lease base stations?\n– # of towers are required?\n– Capex associated with building/leasing base stations?\n– What are the operational (ongoing) expenses?\nc. Customer Premise Equipment\n• What is the cost of the equipment that is required on the customer’s premises?\n• What % of the cost could be passed on to the customer?\n(2) SG&A\n• Do we have to invest in marketing and sales?\n– Assume these costs are minimal initially and focus on network costs\nPart #1: Calculating Costs\na. Spectrum\nExhibit 2. Historical spectrum auction price\n\nConclusion: Assume spectrum price average of $500M\nb. Base stations\nBase station cost = # of base stations * Cost per base station\n(1) Determine # of base stations:\nUS population = ~300M\nAssume persons per household = 2.5\n# of household = 300M/2.5 = 120M\nMarket share (management estimate) = 5%\n# of serviceable households = 120M * 5% = 6M\nBase station bandwidth = 80,000 kbps\nBandwidth per household = 320 kbps\n% of concurrent connections = 50%\nHouseholds per base station = 80,000 kbps / (320 kbps * 50%) = 500\n# of base stations required = 6M / 500 = 12,000\n(2) Determine cost per base station\nI. Qualitative analysis\n\n\n\n\nBuild (Own & Operate)\nLease\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nCompletely plan, construct, and operate a proprietary network of towers.\n\n\n\n\nLease towers and bandwidth for a rental and maintenance fee.\n\n\n\n\nAdvantages\n\n\nComplete control over network footprint.\nBest tower real estate can be used for network. – Higher location on tower preferable.\n\n\n\n\nSmaller up-front investment.\nTime-to-market advantage as towers already exist.\n\n\n\n\nDisadvantages\n\n\nVery costly to own & operate.\nLonger time-to-market.\n\n\n\n\nAvailability of towers – Coverage not possible if tower real estate unavailable in given location.\n\n\n\n\n\nII. Quantitative analysis\nExhibit 3. Cost of building vs leasing a single base station.\n\nConclusion: Leasing will require lower initial investment ($150K per base station) and allow faster time to market.\nTotal base station cost = # of base stations * Cost per base station = 12,000 * $150K = $1.8B\nc. Customer premise equipment\nAdditional Information: to be given upon asking\n• Customer premise equipment cost is $150 per household.\n• The client Dish Network estimates that 2/3 of the costs could be passed through to customer.\nTherefore, customer premise equipment net cost to the client = $150 * (1/3) * 6M households = $300M\nPart #2: Incremental Revenue vs. Costs\nRevenues\n– Offer broadband Internet only\n– Internet and voice (phone)\n– Triple play (defending core)\n• To be conservative, assume offering broadband Internet only.\n• Assume price is $20 per month.\nTotal Revenues = 6M subscribers * $20/month * 12 month/year = $1,440M = $1.44B\nTotal Costs = Network cost + SG&A (assumed minimal) = Spectrum + Base Stations + Customer Premise Equipment = $500M + $1,800M + $300M = $2.6B\n3. Key Findings\n• Deploying a WiMAX network solution across the USA is extremely expensive; even with leasing base stations, the network cost amounts to $2.6B.\n• Revenue uplift from broadband service would total $1.44B and would not enable the client to break even in year 1.\n• Additional costs may be incurred.\n• Some risks concerning timing of deploying and market pricing need to be addressed.\n4. Recommendation\n• Investment in a WiMAX solution probably does not make sense due to high up-front costs and lower revenue uplift.\n• The client Dish Network should focus on defending the core business of satellite TV. The client should consider taking the following actions:\n- Segment customers and increase share with most profitable segments.\n- Grow scale to reduce cost per subscriber.\n- Go into content: look for acquisition / partnership to drive differentiated content.\n- Technology innovation: Offer DVR to compete with cables’ VOD; Increase number of local and national HD channels.\n- Partner for broadband: e.g., partner with telecommunication companies where they are not building video infrastructure.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: pricing & valuation.\nConsulting Firm: Boston Consulting Group (BCG) first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: sports, leisure & recreatio; mass media & communications.\nCase Interview Question #00990: Our client, The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), is a British public service broadcaster. The company is headquartered at Broadcasting House in London, UK, and is the world’s oldest national broadcasting organization and the largest broadcaster in the world by number of employees, with over 20,000 staff in total (as of 2013).\nOur client BBC is considering participating in an auction for the rights to broadcast the 2018 FIFA World Cup. BBC is a mature company that derives the vast majority of its revenues from selling TV advertisements. BBC has hired our consulting firm to advise them on the bidding. Should BBC bid or not? What factors will affect our bid? How much should we bid on the broadcasting rights? \nAdditional Information: (to be provided when requested by candidate)\n1. The Games \n• The 2018 FIFA World Cup is scheduled to take place in Russia from 14 June to 15 July 2018. The games will last 32 days, beginning with a 2-hour opening ceremony on a Thursday afternoon, and with the final match and the closing ceremony (also 2 hours) on a Sunday evening.\n• We can broadcast 6 hours per weekday and 8 hours per weekend. We can broadcast an extra 2 hours on ceremony days, to allow for the length of the ceremony.\n• We expect heavier viewing during the weekday evenings (2 hours), as well as all the weekend days, with peak viewing during the final day of games and the two ceremonies.\n2. Competition\n• BBC has 3 competitors in the auction.\n• There are 2 smaller US-based players that are looking to boost their international presence, and would likely have considerably higher production costs (and possibly lower advertising revenues). They may be willing to loss-lead on the FIFA World Cup.\n• There is also another large UK-based player, which like BBC, is a mature company. The UK competitor has similar economics as the client.\n3. Revenues\n• We can show ads for no more than 10 minutes per hour, and we charge double our normal rates, so $50K/min for non-prime time, $200K/min for prime, and $500K/min for peak (normally we charge $25K/min, $100K/min and $250K/min, respectively)\n4. Costs\n• Due to the complicated logistics of the event, we will need to spend an extra $10M to produce the broadcast over our normal programming.\nPossible Answer:\nThis pricing/valuation case starts very heavy on assumption-based number crunching. As assumptions are updated, the candidate must correctly adapt his/her answer with arithmetic logic. Finally, the candidate must provide some high level insights on auction dynamics.\nPart #1: Qualitative Analysis\nQuestion: What are the key issues we need to examine?\n• Determine our marginal TV revenue.\n• Know how long the FIFA World Cup runs, how many prime time and non-prime time advertisements can be shown, and what can be\ncharged for each.\n• Take into consideration that receipts are far into the future, but securing the license will require payment now.\n• Figure out how much our competitors will bid in the auction to determine if we should bid, and if so, how much.\nPart #2: Quantitative Analysis\nRevenue Calculations (NOT to be shown to candidate)\n\n\nVariables\nSource/Formula\nCalculations\n\n\n# of peak hours\nfinal day + opening ceremony + closing ceremony\n8+2+2 = 12 hours\n\n\n# of prime hours\nPrime hours per weekday * # of weekdays + # of hours per weekend day * # of weekend days\n2*21 + 8*9 = 114 prime hours\n\n\n# of non-prime hours\nNon-prime hours per weekday * # of weekdays\n4*21 = 84 non-prime hours\n\n\nTotal revenue\n# peak time * Peak rate + # prime time * Prime rate + # non-prime time * non-prime rate\n12*10mins * $500K/min + 114*10mins * $200K/min + 84*10mins * $50K/min = $330M\n\n\nMarginal profits\nTotal revenue/2 – Extra production costs\n$330M/2 = $10M = $155M\n\n\nDetails Around Calculations:\n• Tournament lasts a total of 32 days, of which 21 are weekdays, 9 are normal weekend days, 1 is the opening ceremony, and 1 is the final match day.\n• 2 of 6 weekday hours are prime hours and 4 non-prime hours.\n• Combined with regular weekends we have another 72 prime hours, totally 42+72=114 prime hours and 84 non-prime hours.\n• Adding the ceremonies and the final match day we have a total of 2+2+8=12 peak hours.\n• Candidates should recognize that extra viewership may spill over onto other normal programming and may adjust the expected marginal revenue up between $2.5M and $10M based on reasoned assumptions.\nQuestion: The FIFA World Cup takes place in 2018, but the auction is this year. How much is the future stream of revenue worth today?\nCandidates should identify the time delay between purchasing the rights to broadcast and the receipts from advertisement sales. If the candidate inquires about interest rates, prompt him/her to make reasoned assumptions. Some candidates may need prompting to do this analysis.\n\n\nVariables\nSource/Formula\nCalculations\n\n\nCost of capital\nMake an assumption\n10%\n\n\nTime period\nMatch will be held in 5 years (assuming it is 2013 now)\n5\n\n\nMarginal profits\nCalculated earlier in case\n$155M\n\n\nNet present value (NPV)\n(Marginal profits) / ((1 + Cost of capital)^(Number of years until match))\n$155M/(1.1^5) = $96M\n\n\nPart #3: Recommendation\n• In this case, the client BBC should bid below but close to the projected $96M for the rights to broadcast the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n• But we will want to know more about past bidding behavior of the UK competitor, and whether they are likely to risk losing the auction by underbidding (to increase gains).\n• The smaller competitors from U.S. add uncertainty to the overall mix, making underbidding even less attractive.\nPossible Risks:\n• Candidates should recognize that a bid “at value” is entirely acceptable, because it would produce profits that meet the cost of capital. However, the “at value” bid could be a problem if the overall model is too optimistic (maybe by ignoring downside risks).\n• Our projected revenues could be at risk if there is not sufficient demand to fill all the time slots for advertisements at the given prices.\n• Over- or under-bid because of insufficient understanding of competitors’ positions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new product; market sizing.\nConsulting Firm: IMS Health Consulting Group first round summer internship job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: healthcare: pharmaceutical, biotech, life sciences.\nCase Interview Question #00991: Your client is Allergan, Inc. (NYSE: AGN), a global specialty pharmaceutical company focusing on five areas: ophthalmic pharmaceuticals, dermatology, neuroscience, urology and cosmetics. The company produces neurologic product, Botox, which is used around the world to treat a variety of debilitating disorders associated with muscle overactivity. In cosmetic applications, a Botox injection can be used to prevent development of wrinkles by paralyzing facial muscles.\nMigraine is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent moderate to severe headaches often in association with a number of autonomic nervous system symptoms. Typically the headache affects one half of the head, is pulsating in nature, and lasting from 2 to 72 hours. Associated symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, sound, or smell.\nRecently, the client Allergan is considering expanding the use of Botox to the migraine market and has already begun clinical trials in this arena. Their migraine product is scheduled to launch in year 2016. Your consulting team has been hired to advise on the go-to-market strategy. What is your estimate for the size of the migraine market and the potential revenue?\nAdditional Information: (to be provided when requested by candidate)\n1. Product Features\na. Price\n• The drug will be priced at $200/injection.\nb. Cost\n• N/A but reasonable to expect marginal cost is quite small as most pharmaceuticals have this cost profile.\nc. Attributes\n• The company’s product is given in the form of an injection every 2 months.\n• Offers similar efficacy compared to market leading option but without any side effects.\n• When given for migraines it does have some added skin care benefits.\n2. Customers\n• # of typical migraine sufferers is difficult to approximate since migraines/headaches vary greatly.\n• Assume at least 10% of migraine sufferers are willing to invest in such a medicine.\nPossible Answer:\nThis case has 2 key components. (1) A straight forward market sizing exercise for the migraine market, that will involve discussing the potential size of a target segment (population type market sizing) (2) Discussing the considerations of launching Botox as a different product targeted at a new segment. The candidate should quickly get to the mechanics of market size estimation and arrive at a $ market size. The candidate should then be able to discuss the pros and cons of a product launch, address additional considerations and make a solid recommendation as to how to proceed.\n1. Discussion (to be covered in discussing the candidate’s framework)\na. Sizing the Market\nPopulation:\n• This drug will be produced world wide so the candidate should use world population (6-7 Billion)\n% of population diagnosed with migraines:\n• Reasonable estimate of the number of migraine sufferers (20% of population)\n% treated with OTC (Over The Counter) vs. prescription medications (i.e. severe migraine sufferers):\n• Assume that about 50% of chronic migraine sufferers experience severe migraines and are willing to purchase prescription products.\nExpected market share for the product:\n• Due to the absence of side effects and the beneficial skin care properties assume 40% of overall market in 5 years. If competition from generics have been raised assume 20%.\nb. Product\nPrice:\n• Will customers require insurance coverage?\n• Is it reasonable to expect patients to be willing to pay more than they are currently?\nDelivery Method:\n• Inconvenience of MD /hospital visits for injections\nBenefits:\n• How might the additional skin care benefits from Botox be an asset for the product?\nc. Brand Impact\n• How might the launch of Botox for migraines affect the existing Botox for appearance enhancement business?\n• Should the client launch under a separate brand name in the migraine market?\nd. Competition\n• Immitrex, the market leader in traditional prescription migraine treatments, lost patent protection in December.\n• Candidate should discuss the possibility of aggressive entry of generic competition or ask if generics exist.\n2. Quantitative Analysis\nExample of market sizing calculation:\n\n\nVariables\nSource/Formula\nCalculations\n\n\nWorld population\nGiven\n6 Billion\n\n\n% of people who suffer from chronic headaches/migraines\nAssumed\n20%\n\n\n% severe migraine sufferers\nAssumed\n50%\n\n\nTotal market size in # of patients\nWorld population * % chronic sufferers * % severe\n6B * 20% * 50% = 600M\n\n\n$Price/injection\nGiven\n$200\n\n\n# injections/year\n1 injection / 2 months * 12 month/year\n6\n\n\nAnnual revenue per patient\n$Price/injection * # injections/year\n$200 * 6 = $1,200\n\n\nTotal annual market size in $\n# patients * Annual revenue per patient\n600M * $1,200 = $720B\n\n\nBotox $ market\nTotal market size $ * % of market share\n$720B * 20% = $144B, $720B * 40% = $288B\n\n\nKey Takeaway: The size of the market ($144 – $288 Billion) represents an attractive opportunity .\n3. Recommendation\n• Given the projected $ size of the prescription migraine market this looks like a promising market to enter for the Botox maker and would seem to offer very large revenue potential, and more importantly, profit potential.\n• Launching under another brand name would allow the client to more effectively differentiate between the two uses when advertising the product to consumers and physicians. It would also likely lessen the backlash from the differential pricing.\nRisks & Considerations\n• Launching under the same brand name could cause a public outcry over the discrepancy in price between the migraine version and the plastic surgery version given they are the identical drug.\n• Also, it could cause some patients to use the migraine form instead of buying the plastic surgery version, thus cannibalizing some of the existing sales of Botox.\n• On the other hand, keeping the Botox brand name brings with it the strong reputation Botox has already built through its current use.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: organizational behavior, HR; market entry.\nConsulting Firm: IBM Global Business Services (GBS) first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: software, information technology (IT).\nCase Interview Question #00992: Your client SAP SE is a German multinational software corporation that makes enterprise software to manage business operations and customer relations. As of 2007, SAP is the world’s largest business software company and the third biggest independent software provider by revenue. The corporation operates in four geographic regions: EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa), North America (United States and Canada), LAC (Latin America and Caribbean), and APJ (Asia Pacific and Japan), and it is headquartered in Walldorf, Baden-Württemberg, Germany.\nAs a leading IT services provider and ITES (Information Technology Enterprise Solutions) services provider, the client SAP is a clear world leader in its domain. Recently, the management of SAP wants to expand its ITES department by 100% in the next 2-3 years. So it is looking to open up new branch offices all over the world. You need to come up with some places where it can set up new centers. How would you go about it?\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate: For this case, first I would like to look at the specific requirements of the new centers. Then I would like to know what exactly the current capabilities (technical and financial) of our client are. Once we are sure about the specific need of the center and the existing capabilities of the client, I would evaluate various geographies and decide which best fit our requirements.\nInterviewer: Ok, being the world leader the client SAP has adequate finances. And there are no specific requirements from the center except for what such centers normally end up doing currently. Why don’t you tell me what basic parameters you would be looking at?\nCandidate: Given what you have told me about the requirements, I think the following would be important parameters in judging which places are suitable:\n1. The most important would be the availability of cheap but skilled manpower.\n2. Adequate infrastructure – reliable internet connectivity, electricity included.\n3. Stability of the economy and pro-business policy of the government.\nInterviewer: And what do you mean by places above on which you would be applying these parameters?\nCandidate: I’ll define a place to be a city inside a country.\nInterviewer: Isn’t that too small an area to take?\nCandidate: Yes, I see that point. It would be better to look at countries on the whole. We could decide on specific location later.\nInterviewer: Is there anything else you might want to look at? May be the current state of the IT industry in the country?\nCandidate: Yes, I would also look at the current penetration of IT & ITES industry in the countries we are considering. This would help us in two ways – to identify the business potential that can be targeted directly by placing the center there and secondly, this will also give us an indication of the availability of skilled manpower and already existing experience base in the IT sector. We could source some talent from the existing players. Given we are a major global player, this should not be difficult. Also, due to our larger international footprint already, we should be able to stand firm even if the competition is high.\nInterviewer: Let us limit our parameters to – cost of operations & availability of human capital. Can you draw a graph to show me how countries will be placed and what which ones we’ll choose?\nCandidate: Since we are looking at 2 parameters: cost of operations & availability of human capital, I would like to look at this through a 2 by 2 matrix as follows.\n\nCountries that are low cost and high human capital are the best bets whereas those exactly opposite will be out of picture. For the two other quadrants, we would have to look at on a case by case basis.\nInterviewer: Can you elaborate a little as to how you would do that for the 2 cases where the answer does not look so obvious?\nCandidate: If I were to look at, let us say, the case of low cost and low availability of skilled workforce. For such a country, I would see if the lack of sufficient skills can be met by either relocating people from a nearby place or from other offices of the client and also if they would be willing to do so. The other option is to see if building skills within that place might be possible. The latter is worth considering only if we are ready to wait for some time before the center might start being productive.\nSimilarly, I could look at the other “Maybe” box and see if the the high cost is justified by the level of skills that the people possess there and a center could be justified in a high-cost location if we could shift some of the high end work to that country.\nIn both these cases, the other options I had mentioned initially, apart from the two we are considering, will play an important role in making a decision. There might be places which have a big IT market we have not tapped yet. We might take that place up, even if, let us say it is high cost because there is skilled labour and huge business opportunity.\nInterviewer: Great. I think we have covered the approach pretty well here and also looked at the critical parameters. Thank you.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: market entry.\nConsulting Firm: A.T. Kearney first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: transportation.\nCase Interview Question #00993: Our client is a United States based transportation company. They are in the business of rail wagon leasing. Basically they buy wagons and lease them out to customers such as railway companies. Recently, in order to further drive growth, the client wants to enter the market in India. You have been hired to advise them on this market entry. What are the factors that they should look at?\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate: First of all, as I understand the client’s wagons are to be used for railways. Are they goods wagons or passenger wagons?\nInterviewer: They are all goods wagons.\nCandidate: The factors that I see as possible are:\n1. The objective of the client firm to enter the India market. It might want to take maximum market share or maximize profits.\n2. The market condition in India. The kind of customers and the competition.\n3. The financial strength of the company on the scale it can achieve. The strengths of the company for the particular market.\n4. The regulatory environment.\n5. The market entry strategy of the company if it plans to enter the India market.\nInterviewer: So you have mentioned the demand, competitive landscape, regulatory environment, value proposition of the firm and the entry strategy. Can you think of something else given the way we do our business?\nCandidate: Since we buy and lease wagons, the supply of wagons is also going to be an important factor.\nInterviewer: Sounds good. Let’s move forward and try to estimate the market demand of these wagons in India.\nCandidate: To estimate demand we need to know the customers of these wagons. I think they will be both private and public players.\nInterviewer: In India, the main player is the public player, i.e. the Indian Railways. So what are goods wagons used to transport?\nCandidate: As I see it they can be used to transport:\n1. Oil\n2. Coal\n3. Cement\n4. Iron Ore and other Industrial Raw material.\n5. Perishable goods.\nInterviewer: That’s correct. Let’s try to estimate the demand for the coal transport over a time horizon of 10 years.\nCandidate: What is the current production of coal and the current number of wagons used to transfer the production?\nInterviewer: So the current production of coal is 400,000 tonnes and it is transported using 100,000 wagons. So each wagon is carrying 4 tonnes. What are the factors that can change the demand of wagons in the coming years?\nCandidate: The demand of the wagons in the coming years would depend on:\n1. Growth in the production of coal.\n2. The utilization of the wagons.\n3. The rate of wagon repair and breakdown.\n4. The increase in size of the wagons.\n5. Substitute methods of transport used for coal transport.\nInterviewer: So the coal production is expected to increase at a rate of 10% per year. The size of the wagons will increase by 30% at the end of 5 years. Wagon life is 25 years. Out of the 100,000 current wagons, 10,000 are in their 24th year. The substitutes will come into action after 5 years once the road infrastructure is developed. You can assume that after 5 years 10% of the demand will be served by trucks. What exactly do you mean by utilization?\nCandidate: I meant if the wagons are currently being filled to the brim and can there be anything to increase the packing efficiency of a wagon?\nInterviewer: Well, the wagons are being filled to the brim and no such packing efficiency change is expected. Going further on the utilization aspect can you think of something else that can change utilization?\nCandidate: We are transporting the coal from the mines to the plant. If the wagons return empty we can think of increasing utilization there.\nInterviewer: Good point. But can you think something on the lines of technology change that would increase the coal transferred per day?\nCandidate: The speed of the train. If the speed of the train increases that would increase the utilization.\nInterviewer: Correct. So the speed of the trains is expected to increase by 10% after 5 years. Based on this data can you give me a plan how you would go about estimating demand?\nCandidate: OK, the main changes are taking place after 5 years. So, I can divide the time into 5 years each and estimate demand for each year. Then sum them up to get the final demand.\nInterviewer: That’s correct. Let’s just estimate the demand for the next year because that is the most relevant to our client.\nCandidate: The increase in coal production will cause the demand to go up by 10,000 wagons. Another 10,000 wagons would retire next year. So we can expect the demand to rise by 20,000 next year.\nInterviewer: Great. I think we have had a great discussion. Thank you!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Currently, Liberty Travel makes a 10% commission on all of its travel bookings. The CEO of Liberty Travel is worried because their current profit before taxes is USD $1 Million, while the industry average ranges from $2MM to $3.5MM. Why are they making less than the industry average?\nPossible Solution:\n1. High Level Plan of Attack\n• We need to understand the revenue stream and cost structure of the travel agency and conceptualize how each transaction contributes to the bottom line.\n• Focus on the types of customers the travel agency services and how each type relates to profitability.\n2. Lay Out Your Thoughts\nConsider using the profitability framework: Profits = Revenue – Cost = (Volume * Price) – (Fixed cost + Variable Cost)\n• Focus on the cost side of the equation\n3. Dig Deeper: Gather Facts/Make Calculations\nCandidate: What is the total gross revenue for the travel agency per annum, on average?\nInterviewer: $10 million.\nCandidate: How does the revenue compare to other travel agencies with similar size?\nInterviewer: They are about the same.\nCandidate: What about the product line? Does the client Liberty Travel handle any bookings other than travel tickets?\nInterviewer: No. They just book tickets for their customers.\nCandidate: What are the different customer segments that the agency services?\nInterviewer: There’s the business traveler segment, which comprises about 40% of total revenue, and the leisure traveler\nsegment with the remaining 60%.\nCandidate: How many total transactions does the client process and what is the break down for each customer segment?\nInterviewer: The total number of transactions is around one million per year. On average, about 300K go to the business\nsegment, and 700K to the leisure.\nCandidate: Is there a cost associated with each transaction?\nInterviewer: Yes, each transaction, regardless of which segment, costs $9.\nNote to Candidate: Now you have all the necessary information to calculate the profitability of transactions for each segment.

As one of the major auto service chains in the Chicago metropolitan area, Midas has enjoyed healthy returns on its 30-store operation for the past 10 years. However, management feels that the chain needs to expand, as the current geographical areas in which they are based have become saturated.\nFor the past couple of years, they have aggressively pursued a growth strategy, opening an additional 15 stores. However, it seems that this approach has had negative returns. For the first time in over a decade, the Midas chain’s profits dropped into the negative zone. You were hired by the Midas management to figure out why. How would you go about it?\nPossible Solution:\n1. High Level Plan of Attack\n• You need to understand the nature of the business. What does the auto service entail?\n• Focus on the customer segmentation. Are they serving more than one customer? Any differences?\n• What is the profit structure of the different offerings?\n• Where did they move to? Are the newly formed auto service stores operating differently or serving different markets than before?\n2. Lay Out Your Thoughts\nConsider using the profitability framework: Profits = Revenue – Cost = (Volume * Price) – (Fixed cost + Variable Cost)\n• Focus on how revenue has changed given the environment.\n3. Dig Deeper: Gather Facts/Make Calculations\nCandidate: What type of services has Midas traditionally provided for its customers?\nInterviewer: There are two main businesses under each roof: off-the-shelf car parts and the garage mechanical services.\nCandidate: Are these services provided as well in the newly developed stores?\nInterviewer: Yes.\nCandidate: Have competitors entered the market stealing market share?\nInterviewer: A few competitors have entered the market, but not too many. The expansion was planned to explore new markets and prevent the competition from growing.\nCandidate: What about price? Have prices gone up to help defray some of the costs associated with growth?\nInterviewer: No, they have stayed the same.\nCandidate: Given the two types of businesses for the chain, do they have the same profit margin?\nInterviewer: No. In fact, because the garage services cost the business a great deal more and the mechanics are very well trained, we charge a premium. Profit margin on servicing cars has twice the profit margin of off-the-shelf products.\nCandidate: Are the customers the same for both businesses?\nInterviewer: No. The customer that uses the garage service tends to come from a mid-to-high income bracket. Those that use the off the-shelf auto parts tend to be of the lower-income bracket. They fix their cars on their own.\nCandidate: Where has Midas auto service stores traditionally been located?\nInterviewer: Mostly in, or very close to the suburbs.\nCandidate: Has the geographical location changed as they expanded?\nInterviewer: Yes, They saw certain urban areas as very inexpensive. They located more in inner cities where there are a lot of used car sales.\nCandidate: So, would it be fair to assume that the more profitable business, the garage service, has deteriorated and the sale\nof off-the-shelf parts has increased, causing overall profitability to go down?\nInterviewer: Yes.\n4. Key Findings\n• The garage service is the major revenue generator for the business. As they expanded into the inner cities, they began to attract the wrong customer. Profit margin on the off-the-shelf products is not enough to cover costs and make a healthy return for Midas. A price increase is unlikely given price sensitivity.\n5. Recommendations\n• Scale back from the urban areas. Focus on geographical areas where they can attract the suburban customers who will use the service aspect of the business.\n• Maintain a healthy return on the car product market from the inner city dwellers.\n• Where possible, drop the garage service in under-performing areas to reduce costs and focus on the retail end.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new business.\nConsulting Firm: Samsung Global Strategy Group (GSG) first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: e-commerce & online business; retail.\nCase Interview Question #00981: The client DeMoulas Super Markets, Inc., under the trade name Market Basket, is a regional chain of 75 grocery stores in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Maine in the United States. The company’s headquarters are located in Tewksbury, Massachusetts, about 19 miles (31 km) north-northwest of Boston.\nRecently, the client Market Basket is considering whether or not they should enter the emerging Internet-based grocery shopping/delivery market in the Boston metropolitan area. Market Basket is currently one of the leaders in the traditional grocery store market in northern New England. In their core market, two competitors have emerged in the Internet/at-home grocery shopping business, and are rapidly gaining market share. One of the two companies that has already entered this new marketplace is the client’s primary competitor in the traditional market. The second player is a chain that does not have grocery stores in the target region, but has entered the Boston metropolitan area with Internet shopping delivery services.\nShould the client enter the Internet-based grocery business? If so, how, and what concerns should they have? If not, how do they protect market share from the emerging market that is threatening to steal business?\nPossible Solution:\n1. High Level Plan of Attack\nThis is a market strategy case. The interviewer is looking for a discussion of the client’s customers, competitors, costs, core competencies and the overall market dynamics. In addition, the candidate should be able to present a solution and identify the key success factors for this solution.\n2. Sample Response\nCandidate: The client must first do some preliminary work examining the market for groceries delivered over the Internet. I would like to get a better sense for the company’s current customers, as well as potential customers, to see if the Internet is a viable delivery mechanism for the company. Can you tell me more about the client’s customers in the area?\nInterviewer: The client serves primarily upper-middle class customers.\nCandidate: That’s important to know. I would guess that prospective users of an Internet-based delivery system are upper-middle class. Can you confirm this and elaborate on the growth prospects for this market?\nInterviewer: Your guess is correct. Users of the Internet delivery system are typically upper-middle class. As far as the market is concerned, home grocery shopping among Internet users is growing rapidly and the percentage of homes with Internet access is also growing.\nCandidate: We’ve established that the market is an attractive one, however I still need more evidence before presenting a recommendation. I’d like to now turn to the two competitors described in your case opening. Can you explain their current market share?\nInterviewer: All three local players (including our client) have an equal market share – roughly 15% each.\nCandidate: And can you address recent growth trends among the competition?\nInterviewer: The competitor without grocery stores in the target region is gaining market share more rapidly than the company with stores in the target region.\nCandidate: We’ve established pretty convincingly that the Internet grocery business is attractive. I’d like to now focus on our client. Clearly not all companies are prepared to put their operations on the Internet. There are two central issues I’d like to better understand. First, the company’s core competencies — does it have the requisite skills to address the Internet user? Secondly, I’d like to understand the company’s cost structure. Is such a move feasible for the client? Do you have any information on the company’s distribution capabilities? Specifically, is it able to address the Internet market?\nInterviewer: The company’s current distribution facilities are not adequate for the delivery system.\nCandidate: How about the company’s employees? Are they sufficiently trained to handle delivery tasks associated with the Internet?\nInterviewer: The current employees cannot perform these tasks without more training.\nCandidate: Those are some important considerations to ponder. However, given the market attractiveness for Internet groceries, the client would be crazy to pass up this opportunity. Its customers are Internet users, the competition has already shown a willingness to invest in the market, and the competitor with no stores in the region (i.e. totally reliant on Internet sales) is growing the fastest.\nThat said, the company must be willing to invest in this market to succeed. First, it must improve its distribution capabilities. Further analysis must be done as to whether it should improve its current operations or develop a standalone capability exclusively devoted to the Internet market. Next, it must develop an inventory management system so that it can effectively track what it orders from suppliers, what customers are ordering, and where the product is delivered (Internet vs. traditional). Finally, it must spend enough money to cross-train its employees so that tasks associated with Internet delivery can be effectively performed.\nInterviewer: Are there any other considerations?\nCandidate: When the client company rolls out its Internet operations, it must not disappoint customers. Many of the Internet-based customers will be cannibalized from the traditional operations. In itself, this is not bad. These customers obviously prefer the alternative, and it’s better for the company to retain them versus losing them to competitors. However, failure to deliver on Internet delivery will cause customers to consider switching to the competition. As such, the company must be sure it can effectively deliver on its promises from the moment it enters the Internet market.\nInterviewer: Very good, thank you!\n3. General Summary Comments\nThe candidate does not necessarily have to recommend market-entry for this case. If the candidate believes the company should not enter the market, it must present a compelling business reason why and craft creative alternatives for market share protection. In either case, the key components of market strategy must be understood and addressed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: pricing & valuation; increase sales.\nConsulting Firm: Gallup Consulting first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: Food & Beverages.\nCase Interview Question #00982: he client Mead Johnson Nutrition Company (NYSE: MJN) is a major manufacturer and distributor of infant formula both domestically and globally with its flagship product Enfamil. The company is headquartered in Glenview, Illinois. This case concerns the United States domestic market only.\nThe client Mead Johnson sells their product nationwide in the US, and are in the middle of the pack in terms of market share. They are currently trying to boost their market share in US while maintaining profitability.\nThere is a government welfare program called WIC (Women, Infants, Children) that allows individuals living below the poverty level to receive vouchers for infant formula for their children. Unlike most welfare programs, this one is subsidized by the actual producers of infant formula. On a state-by-state basis, infant formula producers bid for the right to be the sole supplier of infant formula to welfare recipients in that state. In addition to paying the government for the WIC contract, the client also provides rebates to retailers for WIC sales. As a result, income received from WIC sales is substantially less than that received from normal formula sales. In fact, sales to mothers that remain in the WIC program for more than 12 months result in a net loss.\nRecently, the client Mead Johnson is considering bidding on a WIC contract for a given state. In trying to determine how much to bid on the WIC contract, what factors should the client consider? How much should they bid?\nPossible Solution:\n1. High Level Plan of Attack\nThis case is fairly wide open, and presents an issue that is most likely unfamiliar and ambiguous. One challenge will be for the interviewee to find one or more issues that they can explore more in-depth. The basic focus of their analysis should deal with the relative profitability of a WIC contract.\n2. Sample Response\nCandidate: I think for this case I would first look at who the typical WIC customer is, and the dynamic of the relationship, meaning how long are they a customer, and what kind of loyalty is there. Since I don’t have any children, could you tell me more about a typical WIC customer, in regards to buying formula?\nInterviewer: Sure. Obviously the typical WIC customer is poor, since this is a form of welfare. But some things you might not know are that:\n(1) the average WIC recipient stays in the program for less than 12 months,\n(2) mothers typically remain loyal to a brand through infancy for their first child, but for subsequent children recipients often switch back and forth between brands, and\n(3) infants typically require formula the first 22 months of their life.\nCandidate: Thanks. With that knowledge, I can start to think about the issues facing this client company. In trying to decide the terms for the contract, profitability is the primary driver. There’s obviously some issue of social-enterprise here, but even so, I think profitability will drive much of the decision. Since the WIC recipient gets rebates in addition to the subsidized cost of the product, we need to quantify that rebate in order to understand what the profitability per recipient is. Can you tell me that?\nInterviewer: For the purposes of this case, let’s assume that the rebates average an additional 10% (off of the regular retail price).\nCandidate: OK. So the profit per customer might be determined by (WIC revenue – rebates – COGS). So if the revenue is $100/customer/year, and the rebates are $10, and COGS are $75, we make $15 per customer per year. As long as we’re paying less per customer for these rights to be the sole-supplier, we’re in the black.\nInterviewer: For the most part, your logic is correct. But is there anything else that might be a factor in determining profit?\nCandidate: Well, related to the actual profitability of the WIC product I’m not sure. But maybe there are some hidden costs or revenues that I’m not thinking about. In fact, maybe there are some synergistic revenues that the company can achieve. If they get the contract, that gets them additional shelf-space in the stores. And not just WIC recipients shop in the stores. So maybe they will be able to increase market share, just by being on the shelf. Of course, they are getting full retail price for those sales. So I might add in an additional sales minus COGS to the equation. But to try and get an idea of that figure might be tough. How long do these contracts last?\nInterviewer: Typically, several years.\nCandidate: Ok, so knowing that a contract is several years, say 5, we can begin to get a total dollar value for the contract. If we know how many WIC recipients there are in this state that we’re bidding, we can calculate expected revenues. Also, if we can get an idea of how much shelf space we would have, we can quantify the synergistic sales.\nInterviewer: Good. I’m not going to make you go through the math on it, because we’re about out of time, but you’re right. There are 1.2 million WIC recipients in the state, and shelf-space is awarded based on volume sales. So for this company to get the contract, it can help them have more sales volume, and thus more shelf-space, and hopefully then more market share.\n3. General Summary Comments\nUltimately, the candidate should come up with some sort of explanation for how numbers would be run to estimate an appropriate contract bid. One example might be:\n(WIC revenue – rebates – COGS) + (synergistic non-WIC revenue – COGS) >= Contract Bid\nCOGS takes into account economies of scale.\nReal world situation is that synergies are strong, and WIC recipients bounce in and out of program but stay loyal to product for first-borns. Not only are the synergies positive, but also on average WIC recipients are profitable because they pay retail price for nearly half of the formula that they purchase over the first 22 months of their child’s life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

You are immediately assigned to our British Times case team. The Times is a British daily national newspaper based in London. It is an upscale, highly respected newspaper. It is the most widely read newspaper in Great Britain, especially its very strong business and financial section. The paper is a cross between the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, both in content as well as in reputation.\nThe case team has already had one meeting with the newspaper’s online spin-off: thetimes.co.uk. You are going to join the case team for the second meeting, which will be held with only the CEO of thetimes.co.uk. Currently, their web site is nothing more than an online version of the newspaper, otherwise called brochureware.\nThe newspaper’s and the web spin-off’s single biggest asset is the highly respected brand name: The Times. The purpose of this second meeting is for the consulting case team to present its response to the CEO’s current predicament: How to realize greater revenues from their current online spin-off (thetimes.co.uk). How would you go about this case?\nAdditional Information:\nThe web site thetimes.co.uk conducted a viewer survey, receiving a high enough number of responses to be statistically\nsignificant, allowing them to feel comfortable using the following information for planning purposes.\n• Their web site has a large number of hits, only 30% fewer unique visitors than the number 1 site in the UK.\n• Their hits are from viewers in the 75th percentile of customer income.\n• Their viewers are also highly educated: 60% have a university education and 30% of whom have graduate degrees.\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate: In general, it’s fair to say that the bulk of Internet revenues comes from three sources: advertising, subscriptions, and transactions. I think that the key to helping the CEO is to tailor these initiatives to thetimes.co.uk core assets.\nInterviewer: Good points. Can you give me more details on each of these sources of revenues?\nCandidate: Well, let’s look at advertising first. We could suggest two avenues: banner ads and corporate sponsorship. Upscale or corporate banner ads such as insurance companies, banks, or brokerage firms would make a lot of sense with our audience. They are highly educated and more importantly, have the highest level of disposable income. In addition to banner ads, we should look into corporate sponsorship. We should take full advantage of the fact that the strong business section can obtain corporate sponsorships; for example, banks or e-trade companies pay for their section of the site.\nInterviewer: Good. They do some of that already but probably not as much as they could. You also mentioned other sources of revenues. Could you explain your subscription model?\nCandidate: We could imagine a three-tier approach. For example, in tier 1, readers could have access to today’s news for free. For a small fee, Tier 2 subscribers could research up to one-week-old articles in the archive. Finally, in the last tier, subscribers could have access to the entire archive.\nInterviewer: Coming from a traditional publishing company, they are fairly familiar with these two models. I would be interested in hearing more about your third option.\nCandidate: One way to “monetize” their attractive audience would be by offering targeted products and services. Some examples could be a tollbooth model. This would clearly require a deep analysis of the competitive landscape and of the company’s capability (technical, people…) to start a completely new line of business. These products or services would have to be: High margin, Upscale, Highly profitable vertical businesses; for instance: golf store, tax advice, investment advice, upscale travel (cruises, etc.)\nInterviewer: Golf equipment? This is interesting. How would you go about sizing the market for golf equipment in the UK?\nCandidate: To determine the golf store’s (equipment only) first year total revenue, we would have to figure out the following:\n• The population of the UK\n• The percentage connected to the Internet in the UK\n• The number who browse this site (thetimes.co.uk)\n• The number who browse the golf store\n• The number who buy from this site: the buy to browse ratio\n• The average amount spent per transaction\n• The number of times they buy per year\n• The commission received by thetimes.co.uk\nInterviewer: Good. There are approximately 60 million people living in the UK. Why don’t you make some assumptions and run a rough estimation for me?\nCandidate: If we assume that half of the people in the UK are connected to the Internet, we have: 60M * 1/2 = 30M\nIf we assume that 20% of the people connected to Internet will visit The Times site, we now have: 30M * 20% = 6 million visitors\nNot all of them will click on the golf site. Probably about 20% will do. We can now estimate the number of people browsing the golf site: 6M * 20% = 1,200,000 visitors\nIf we assume that only 10% of them will actually purchase on the site, we now have: 1,200,000 * 10% = 120,000 buyers.\nEach buyer may spend on average $100 each time they visit and they may visit the site 2 times each year. If we assume a 5% margin, we now have a rough idea of the golf equipment first year revenues:\n120,000 * $100 * 2 * 5% = $1,200,000 \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: improve profitability.\nConsulting Firm: Capgemini first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: chemicals.\nCase Interview Question #00974: Your client Ecolab Inc. (NYSE: ECL) is a global chemical manufacturer headquartered in St. Paul, Minnesota, United States. It was originally founded as Economics Laboratory in 1923 and its major line of product is a chemical preservative that is used to preserve foods in containers.\nA preservative is a substance that is added to products such as food, beverages, and many other products to prevent decomposition by microbial growth or by undesirable chemical changes. Preservative food additives reduce the risk of foodborne infections, decrease microbial spoilage, and preserve fresh attributes and nutritional quality.\nDespite an significant increase in market share, the client Ecolab has experienced a decline in profits. The CEO of the company is worried about this trend and hires your consulting firm to investigate. How would you go about it?\nPossible Solution: \n1. High Level Plan of Attack\nThe first thing we need to figure out is what does “an significant increase in market share” mean? Remember, the term “market share” is a percentage, and not an absolute number. It could imply that the company has increased its share of the market by beating out the competition, or the competition exiting the market. It could also mean that the market is actually shrinking, but the sales of the company are decreasing by less than those of its competitors.\n2. Lay Out Your Thoughts\nConsider using the profitability framework: Profits = Revenue – Cost = (Volume * Price) – (Fixed cost + Variable Cost)\n• Focus mostly on the revenue side, taking into consideration the economic and competitive landscape.\n3. Dig Deeper: Gather Facts/Make Calculations\nCandidate: Has the client company experienced any significant increase in cost in the last couple of years related to any additional fixed or variable cost?\nInterviewer: No, costs have been steady.\nCandidate: On the revenue side, has there been an increase in the volume of output?\nInterviewer: Slightly, a little bit higher than the industry average.\nCandidate: What about the competition? Have there been any new entrants on the scene?\nInterviewer: Actually, competition has decreased. A number of players have exited the industry.\nCandidate: Why has that been the case?\nInterviewer: They were losing money. They felt that the industry had gotten saturated, so they left.\nCandidate: Has sales decreased for the industry overall?\nInterviewer: Yes, there has been a general negative trend in the last few years. There certainly has been less demand for\nthe product.\nCandidate: Are any substitute products being used?\nInterviewer: Not really. Preservatives in general are being used less and less in foods. Fresh food is now the preferred choice for many consumers.\nCandidate: What about the makers of food? Are they experiencing decreased volume?\nInterviewer: Yes, the entire industry has been slowing.\nCandidate: Are they forced to lower their prices to survive?\nInterviewer: They certainly are. Additionally, to lower costs, they are using their leverage to renegotiate price structures of raw materials.\nCandidate: So is the company in question forced to lower its prices?\nInterviewer: Yes. They are gaining market share, but it’s because of a number of competitor fallouts.\nCandidate: But costs have stayed the same?\nInterviewer: Yes.\n4. Key Findings\n• The industry overall is shrinking. To survive, the client company Ecolab has been competing on price. It has gained market share at the expense of its competition, forcing some to exit the industry.\n• Its sales have only increased slightly.\n• The decrease in price has caused the company to lower its profits, despite the increase in market share.\n• Profit margin has been lower on a per volume basis.\n5. Recommendations\n• Focus on cost reduction. If price is the only way to compete, then costs must decrease.\n• Collaborate with the competition to increase leverage in negotiation.\n• Diversify into other chemicals that are in demand. Reduce the risk of market trends via a portfolio of products. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: business competition, competitive response; reduce costs.\nConsulting Firm: Samsung Global Strategy Group (GSG) first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: manufacturing; automotive, motor vehicles.\nCase Interview Question #00975: Our client is a large tire manufacturer in Vietnam named “VieTire Inc.”. For more than a decade VieTire has been the only player in that market due to high tariffs on imports. They dominate the tire industry in Vietnam. As it stands, the tariff is 50% of the total cost to produce and ship a tire to Vietnam.\nRecently, however, due to the forces of globalization and lower consumer prices, the Vietnamese government has just decided to lower the tariff by 5% a year for the next ten years. VieTire is very concerned about this change, as it will radically alter the landscape of the tire industry in Vietnam. They have hired your consulting firm to assess the situation and to advise them on what steps to take. What would you recommend?\nPossible Solution:\n1. High Level Plan of Attack \n• The first thing we need to understand is the current cost structure of VieTire’s product.\n• Next, we must determine the impending competitive situation.\n• Then, calculate the impact the reduction of tariff will have.\n• Finally, recommend specific steps that VieTire can take to protect themselves from increased competition.\n2. Lay Out Your Thoughts\nConsider using the profitability framework: Profits = Revenue – Cost = (Volume * Price) – (Fixed cost + Variable Cost)\n• Specify what steps we must take to understand the cost differences now, and in the future, of VieTire and its competitors.\n3. Dig Deeper: Gather Facts/Make Calculations\nCandidate: What would you say are the major costs associated with making a tire?\nInterviewer: Raw material comprise about 20% of the cost, labor 40%, and all other costs such as overhead 40%. The average tire cost about $40 to make.\nCandidate: It seems that labor is a major cost, $16 per tire. Why?\nInterviewer: Things are done more manually in Vietnam. Most of technological advances in the industry have not yet been implemented in Vietnam.\nCandidate: What about the cost structure of the competition?\nInterviewer: An average tire manufacturer in the U.S. produces tires at a cost of $30 each.\nCandidate: Assuming shipping cost to Vietnam of $4 per tire, and a tariff of 50%, the average cost of an imported tire in Vietnam amounts to ($30 + $4) * (1 + 50%) = $51. So currently, even though the cost to produce a tire in the U.S. is much cheaper due to technological advances, foreign competitors are out of luck because of the tariff.\n\n\nYear\nTariff\nCost\nResult of Competition\n\n\nNow\n50%\n$34 * 1.5 = $51\nWill not enter\n\n\n1 \n45% \n$34 * 1.45 = $49.3\nWill not enter\n\n\n2 \n40% \n$34 * 1.4 = $47.6\nWill not enter\n\n\n3 \n35% \n$34 * 1.35 = $45.9\nWill not enter\n\n\n4 \n30% \n$34 * 1.3 = $44.2\nConsideration of entrance if willing to take a cut on price\n\n\n5 \n25% \n$34 * 1.25 = $42.5\nConsideration of entrance if willing to take a cut on price\n\n\n6 \n20% \n$34 * 1.2 = $40.8\nPreparing to enter\n\n\n7 \n15% \n$34 * 1.15 = $39.1\nEntered the market\n\n\n8 \n10% \n$34 * 1.1 = $37.4\nCompeting on the market\n\n\n4. Key Findings\n• Depending on what price they are willing to set, the competition will start to think about entering the market in year four. In year 7, the competition will surely enter as their prices become lower than domestically produced tires.\n• This analysis assumes that the cost structure for the competition will remain constant. It is important to note that because of the rapid advances in technology, chances are that the costs of producing tires will decrease resulting in foreign competitors entering the market even sooner.\n5. Recommendations\n• The client VieTire needs to benchmark against word class tire manufacturers and re-engineer production methods and cost structures.\n• They must invest in the latest technology in order to reduce their labor/operations costs.\n• The company should focus on increasing the skills of labor while at the same time contain their hourly wage.\n• Need to develop loyalty from their customers/consumers in order to lock in a certain percentage of the market share.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: pricing & valuation.\nConsulting Firm: Capgemini first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: food & beverages.\nCase Interview Question #00976: The client Tropicana Products, Inc. is an American multinational company which primarily makes fruit-based beverages. It was founded in 1947 by Anthony T. Rossi in Bradenton, Florida. Since 1998 it has been owned by PepsiCo. Tropicana’s headquarters are in Chicago, Illinois. The company specializes in the production of orange juice.\nTraditionally, the client Tropicana has packaged their orange juice in 18-ounce carton containers. Recently, in response to demand from the market, they purchased a machine that packages the juice in plastic gallons (36 ounces). Over the next couple of years, the management saw that sales continued to grow on average of 20% per year. Yet, as sales continued to increase, profits steadily decreased. The CEO of Tropicana cannot understand why. He has hired you to help out. What would you tell the CEO?\nPossible Solution: \n1. High Level Plan of Attack\n• We know that sales have been increasing, so revenue is not an issue. The problem must be costs.\n• Because of the change in packaging, the juice producer Tropicana has incurred additional costs that are not accounted for, causing profits to decline.\n2. Lay Out Your Thoughts\nConsider using the profitability framework: Profits = Revenue – Cost = (Volume * Price) – (Fixed cost + Variable Cost)\n• Gather information on the revenue side, but focus mostly on the cost side.\n3. Dig Deeper: Gather Facts/Make Calculations\nCandidate: Looking at the revenue side, how much did the client Tropicana charge for the 18 oz. carton?\nInterviewer: $2.00 per container.\nCandidate: For the 36 oz. plastic gallons?\nInterviewer: For twice the size, the client Tropicana figured he would provide an incentive to buy by selling them at $3.50 per gallon.\nCandidate: How was the cost of the new equipment accounted for in the price?\nInterviewer: The client ended up raising prices across the board by $.50 on all packages, both cartons and gallons, selling at $2.50 and $4.00, respectively.\nCandidate: What about cost of packaging? Does it cost the same to package the juice in cartons as it does in plastic gallons?\nInterviewer: Well, I guess not. Plastic is more expensive than the paper carton we have traditionally used. Also, we had to hire more experienced labor to operate the machine because it is a little more complicated than the carton machine. We figured that because the demand was higher for the gallons – we would cover our costs through increased volume.\nCandidate: What about overhead costs?\nInterviewer: All costs for the factory are added together and divided by the number of units produced.\nNote: This should raise alarm bells. This is now clearly an issue of cost allocation. The price on the plastic gallons should be higher due to higher costs. Now the candidate needs to see to what extent this is affecting the bottom line.\nCandidate: Let’s try to understand the trend in sales. What percentage of plastic gallons versus paper cartons is sold?\nInterviewer: The more our customers notice the plastic gallons, the more they like them. As the overall volume is increasing, plastic gallons have comprised 60% of the sales. The Tropicana management has been very pleased about that.\nCandidate: It seems to me that it costs more to package in the plastic gallons, yet the price is not higher on a per ounce basis. In fact, it’s lower. Have you done any proper cost allocation to determine which type of product should carry which costs?\nInterviewer: No, we haven’t.\n4. Key Findings\n• The major finding in this case is the additional costs associated with the plastic gallons were averaged out over all units, including cartons. This resulted in a mis-allocation of costs and inappropriate pricing.\n• The plastic gallon products have been priced at a lower rate than they should have been.\n• Result: the more plastic gallons the client sold, the more profit the company lost out on.\n5. Recommendations\nThis client firm should conduct a thorough analysis of activity based costing to determine the overhead costs and direct\ncosts associated with each item in the product line. They should then use this data to price accordingly. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: market entry, new market.\nConsulting Firm: OC&C Strategy Consultants first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage:  telecommunications, network.\nCase Interview Question #00977: Our client Rogers Cable is Canada’s largest cable television service provider with about 2.25 million television customers, and over 930,000 Internet subscribers, primarily in Southern & Eastern Ontario, New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador. Rogers Cable is a division of Rogers Communications Partnership, itself wholly owned by Rogers Communications Inc.\nThe client Rogers Cable had recently entered the US market in the northeast to expand its market share. Rogers Cable saw this move as an opportunity to capture a large part of the Northeast US market (4MM consumers in total) in a market with very little competition. However, in the last couple of years, much to the surprise of management, Rogers Cable has been unable to make a profit. You have been hired to figure out why and advise them on their next move. What would you do?\nPossible Solution: \n1. High Level Plan of Attack\n• We need to understand why the company is losing money despite the market being uncompetitive.\n• We must analyze both the revenue and cost side of the problem.\n• We should also analyze the differences in viewing behavior and income between the customer base of Rogers Cable in Canada and in the northeast.\n• We will also determine the strength of any competitors and substitutes.\n2. Lay Out Your Thoughts\nConsider using the profitability framework: Profits = Revenue – Cost = (Volume * Price) – (Fixed cost + Variable Cost)\n• Focus on the consumer\n3. Dig Deeper: Gather Facts/Make Calculations\nCandidate: Let’s look at costs first. Did Rogers Cable incur additional costs per customer on average in the new market?\nInterviewer: No, based on the potential number of subscribers, they have instituted the same system that was in place. Costs associated with cable wire, debt, maintenance costs, etc. are all proportionally the same.\nCandidate: What about the number of subscribers. Out of the 4MM potential customers in Northeast U.S., how many are signed up?\nInterviewer: Only 2.1MM.\nCandidate: Are other cable companies capturing the remaining market?\nInterviewer: No, competition is not an issue. Those that we have not acquired as customers simply do not have cable.\nCandidate: What about substitutes and viewing behavior? How is the consumer in the Northeast U.S. different from the one in Canada?\nInterviewer: Well, the Canadian consumer does not rely much on local stations for watching TV. Cable is a major source of entertainment and news coverage. In the northeast US, we tend to see consumers shy away from paying the $40 a month cable bill. They settle for watching local stations.\nCandidate: Does the new market lave a lower income level?\nInterviewer: Yes, they do, by about 20% on average.\nCandidate: What about the local stations? How many are they? Do they meet most of the needs of the consumer?\nInterviewer: There about 16 local stations that have coverage over the entire northeast. I guess they are doing pretty well by providing programming that the consumer wants. You tend to see the average consumer in the northeast watch regular TV more than Cable when compared with the Canadian consumer.\nCandidate: Do these stations have good reception and how much do they charge?\nInterviewer: They have a very good reception and they are part of basic TV, so they are free.\nCandidate: Is Rogers Cable providing any type of programming that the local stations are not providing?\nInterviewer: Some, but the consumers in northeast US don’t seem to be interested. They don’t feel that it’s worth $40 a month.\n4. Key Findings\n• There is a great deal of competition in the area, not from other cable companies, but from local TV stations.\n• The consumer in northeast US is quite different from the consumer in Canada with respect to television viewing habits.\n• Consumers are not willing to pay $40/month for a service that they already get for free.\n5. Recommendations\n• Rogers Cable could try to cater its current channel offering by offering a smaller package for those that would be interested in couple of cable channels.\n• Scale back its operations to a specific region.\n• Educate the consumer on the extra benefit and new low price.\n• If none of these strategies work, Rogers Cable should move out of that market.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: market entry, new market; industry analysis.\nConsulting Firm: Cognizant Business Consulting (CBC) first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: food & beverages.\nCase Interview Question #00978: Our client Britvic plc (LSE: BVIC) is a British producer of soft drinks based in Hemel Hempstead. It is the number two soft drinks producer (by volume and retail sales value) in the United Kingdom. The company owns a number of leading brands in the UK including Britvic itself, R. White’s Lemonade, Tango, Robinson’s and J2O – as well as being the licensed bottler for PepsiCo products within the UK.\nRecently, the client Britvic is looking to diversify its holdings by investing in a new fast food restaurant chain in the United States. You are hired to determine whether they should pursue this path, and, if so, how they should go about execution. What would you do?\nPossible Solution:\n1. High Level Plan of Attack\n• Understand the client company’s logic for entering into the fast food industry in US.\n• Examine the overall trends in the U.S. fast food industry, and determine which segment is the most promising.\n• Assess the overall demographic changes and major trends in eating habits.\n• Determine what competencies the client can provide that will help it enter this business and be successful.\n• What are some of the high level strategies that the company should consider when entering?\n2. Lay Out Your Thoughts\n• We need to understand the U.S. fast food industry.\n• Consider using Porter’s 5 forces as a starting point: competition, substitutes, new entrants, suppliers, customers.\n3. Dig Deeper: Gather Facts/Make Calculations\nCandidate: First of all, why is the client thinking of investing in the fast food industry and not another?\nInterviewer: The fast food industry has been experiencing sustainable growth for the last few years, and we believe that it will continue to grow.\nCandidate: Why in the US market and not the UK?\nInterviewer: The US is more attractive economically and the client Britvic has been present in the country for a few years.\nCandidate: Does the company know much about the fast food industry and its consumers?\nInterviewer: Not very much. They’re not sure where to enter.\nCandidate: The fast food industry as a whole might be growing, but let’s think about which segment is growing the most and where it would make sense for the company to enter. If we look at the traditional burger outfits, that segment is pretty much dominated by three players: McDonalds, Burger King, and Wendy’s. I would think that the barriers to entry are pretty high for this segment. You also have pizza, Mexican, chicken, cold cut sandwiches, prepared meals (e.g. Boston Market).\nHas the client thought about which segment to enter?\nInterviewer: No. But what do you think, at a high level, which segment should they enter?\nNote: At this point, the candidate should quickly run through the pros and cons of the various segments.\nCandidate: Well, if we take a look at the company itself, it is more inclined to be in the prepared meals segment, given that it is British and has a European appeal. If we look at the trends, the U.S. population is getting older and more families have two working parents. Also, there seems to be a move towards eating more healthy foods. If we consider the competition, the segment seems to be at the growing stages, with only one or two known players. The barriers to entry are certainly not as high as some of the other segments.\nTo distinguish itself from the competition, the client can make food with a British theme, priced competitively. The company can also set up shop in major grocery stores, as more people are purchasing prepared foods as part of the their grocery shopping.\nIt would be a fair assumption to say that Britvic can capitalize on its distribution and marketing experience in the US.\n4. Key Findings\n• There seems to be potential in the prepared food segment (players like Boston Market).\n• The client Britvic seems to be a good candidate to enter the U.S. fast food market and take advantage of the present opportunity.\n5. Recommendations\n• Based on this assessment, Britvic should enter the U.S. fast food market on a large scale. To offer competitive pricing, they must have economies of scale.\n• Quickly develop strong brand equity. Look at the franchising option. Examine in detail how the most successful fast food outlets operate.\n• Consider acquiring an existing chain versus starting a brand new one.\n• Location is extremely important. Know your customers in every region, and focus on convenience.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: market entry; pricing & valuation.\nConsulting Firm: Siemens Management Consulting (SMC) first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: telecommunications, network.\nCase Interview Question #00954: Our client Deutsche Telekom AG (FWB: DTE) (English: German Telecom) is a large German telecommunications company headquartered in Bonn. Deutsche Telekom was formed in 1996 as the former state-owned monopoly Deutsche Bundespost was privatized. Deutsche Telekom also holds substantial shares in other telecom companies in Europe.\nRecently, the client Deutsche Telekom is considering making a bid for one of 5 licenses to operate a new generation of mobile phone network (5G) in the United Kingdom. 5G (5th generation mobile networks or 5th generation wireless systems) denotes the next major phase of mobile telecommunications standards beyond the current 4G/IMT-Advanced standards.\nDeutsche Telekom has engaged Siemens Management Consulting to help with the bidding issue and to determine the appropriate strategy for the auction. Should the client bid for the first 5G license in UK? If yes, how much should the client bid?\nAdditional Information:\na. If the candidate asks for more information on the auction, provide the following info:\nThe auction will be a sealed bid auction with all bids received simultaneously. The licenses will go to the highest 5 bidders. Each bidder can attain only one license. The British government intends for the auction to open the mobile phone market to competition to help control consumer prices. As a result, one license has been reserved for a new entrant, but the other four are open to both new entrants as well as established competitors. Because it is a sealed bid auction, our client will not know the true bidding strategies of its competitors with any certainty. The auction is the first of its kind for 5G networks in Europe. The licenses will be valid for 5 years.\nb. If the candidate asks for more information on the technology, provide the following info:\nThe most important characteristics of the new 5G network are the high data speeds and increased capacity for service that it offers. 5G networks will enable data speeds of up to five times greater than the most advanced 4G networks available today. These high data speeds could enable applications such as speedy access to corporate networks ond the Internet, video-on-demand, online shopping, and video conferencing, all via a mobile device. More importantly, however, the additional 5G spectrum enables incumbent wireless companies to build out their capacity in order to support more customers and to enable high-bandwidth services in an environment that is increasingly becoming capacity-constrained. Following the introduction of 5G technology, old technology networks will be phased out by the government over the span of 3 years.\nLet the candidate drive the case. The candidate should, at this time, draw out a framework. Here is some of the information that a candidate may ask for. Provide this only if the candidate asks.\nc. More about our client Deutsche Telekom\n• Deutsche Telekom is the clear market leader in Germany.\n• Has large presence in the rest of Europe, but no presence in the United Kingdom currently.\n• Has been experiencing stagnating growth.\n• Looking for opportunities to expand.\n• Has the financial capability to bid what is needed, but does not want to overpay for license.\n• Has the financial capability to build network that will be needed to operate in UK.\nd. The competition\n• It’s unclear how many competitive bids will be received or who will bid.\n• 4 major wireless network operators exist in the current UK market.\n– They roughly split the market equally.\n– They already have established networks as well as retail outlets that they can leverage for the introduction of 5G technology.\ne. The market\n• Approximately 30 million people have a mobile phone in the UK.\n• Growth has been slow recently (3%-5% per year).\n• Converting to the new 5G network will require the purchase of a 5G network-enabled mobile device.\n• Customers pay $30 per month for their current mobile phone plans.\nPossible Answer:\n1. Suggest Framework\nThe candidate should approach this “market entry” case in two sections. First, the candidate must assess if the market is attractive enough for our client to enter. To do this, they must assess the profitability when considering entry into this market.\nProfit = Revenue – Cost = (Volume * Price) – (Fixed Cost + Variable Cost)\nSecond, after assessing the profitability, the candidate should come to a conclusion about the attractiveness of market entry. If the candidate concludes that it is a profitable venture for our client, he or she must next develop a methodology for the bid recommendation.\n2. Analysis\nDo not provide the candidate with any information about the framework above. Rather, push him/her to make assumptions about each factor. Some of these qualitative considerations should include:\na. Volume\n• Some potential for growth beyond current market due to new services.\n• Must consider that conversion of customers will be critical and that client is at a disadvantage compared to established competitors.\n• A likely outcome is that our client will receive less than 1/5 of the total customers due to new entrant status.\nb. Price\n• Likely able to charge more than what customers currently pay.\n– Could charge additional fees for additional services and allow customer to pick and choose what they want.\n– Could charge more for a fixed plan with all services included.\n• However, there will also be increased competition in the market.\n• Candidate should consider both the factors that will increase the price (new services) and decrease the price (increased competition).\nc. Fixed Cost\n• Significant up-front cost for our client as they must sec up network and retail chains.\n• Up-front costs not as significant for established competitors. This is a key disadvantage to our client.\n• Once network is established, fixed costs consist of:\n– Network operation\n– Maintenance\n– Retail operations, etc.\nd. Variable Cost\n• Minor once network is established (i.e. one extra customer costs very little)\nIf the candidate struggles to provide quantitative estimates of the above issues, provide the following data:\na. Volume\n• Increase of 33% in customers (to 40M) overall\n• Client will receive 1/8 of market annually (5M total)\nb. Price\n• Average prices will increase to $50 due to new service adoption among key cusromer segments.\nc. Fixed costs\n• $740M to build network\n• $50M to run network annually\nd. Variable costs\n• $50M to run network annually\nAt this point, instruct the candidate not to worry about discounting future cash flows (or that the discount rate is 0%).\nAfter assessing the profitability, the candidate should come to a conclusion about the attractiveness of market entry. If the candidate concludes that it is a profitable venture for our client, he or she must next develop a methodology for the bid recommendation. Points to consider when making the bid recommendation include:\n• Competitors’ strategies\n– Established competitors willing to pay far more as their fixed costs are significantly lower.\n– It is unlikely that our client would be willing to outbid the established competitors as a result.\n• The client’s real competition comes from other new entrants for the license reserved for them.\n• Our client’s bid is based on our assessment of the profitability\n– The bid could be as high as the total value of the cash flows from the license (i.e. at break-even)\n– However, the candidate should consider if the bid should be lower to realize some profits from the venture.\nIf the candidate uses the above assumptions, their calculations should appear as the following:\n\n\n\n\nYear 1\nYear 2\nYear 3\nYear 4\nYear 5\n\n\n\nPrice per Customer\n$50\n$50\n$50\n$50\n$50\n\n\n\nVolume of Customers\n5M\n5M\n5M\n5M\n5M\n\n\n\nRevenues\n$250M\n$250M\n$250M\n250M\n$250M\n\n\n\nTotal Revenue:\n$1,250M\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFixed Costs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuild Network\n$740M\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\nRun Network\n$50M\n$50M\n$50M\n$50M\n$50M\n\n\n\nVariable Costs:\n$50M\n$50M\n$50M\n$50M\n$50M\n\n\n\nTotal Costs:\n$1,240M\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfit (no discounting)\n$10M\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result, the bid should be no higher than $10M.\n3. Recommendation\nThe client has asked us for our recommendation. What would you tell the client?\nHere is a possible response:\nThe 5G mobile network in the United Kingdom is a profitable market for our client. Although our client will face significant competition from established players, I believe they will be able to operate profitably over the life of the license. As a result, our client should enter a bid in the auction. Based on my calculations, the most our client should bid is $10M to breakeven on the license. However, there are considerable risks surrounding this bid that should also be considered.\n4. Additional Considerations\nWhat are some of the potential risks and potential upsides?\nHere are some potential answers for risks:\n• Customer adoption of new services may not be strong.\n• Competitive response is unclear and could drive prices down.\n• Estimates are unclear at this point and could swing the bid either way very easily.\nHere are some potential answers for upsides:\n• May be able to attain a greater share of the market with good market entry strategy.\n• Entry into market could provide platform for continued presence in UK.\n• Winning one of the first 5G license in Europe might be important and set the tone for the remaining auctions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: growth; new business.\nConsulting Firm: Capital One first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: Oil, Gas & Petroleum Industry; Food & Beverages.\nCase Interview Question #00955: You are working on a project in the small town of Contrivedville. The town is an outpost in the middle of The Mojave Desert, 100 miles away from its nearest neighbor to the West (Westown) and 100 miles away from its nearest neighbor to the East (Eastown). The town currently has a population of 200 people.\nThe town of Contrivedville has only two gas stations, Station A and Station B, with each one located on the opposite ends of the town. Station A’s owner has engaged your consulting team to help grow his business.\n1. Without any additional information, what are some potential strategies your client, Station A’s owner, might be able to employ to grow his business?\n2. What types of information would you like to know to better understand strategic options?\nPossible Answer:\nIn the early part of the case, let the candidate think about how a gas station could potentially grow revenues/profits without giving away additional information. Utilizing a framework is not necessary in the first part of the case, but may be helpful for the candidate to generate ideas.\nPotential ideas may include:\n• Raising fuel prices\n• Cutting direct labor costs\n• Cutting fuel costs (long-term contracts, hedging against fuel prices)\n• Advertising\n• Expanding beyond selling gas to sell other things (convenience store food/drink items)\nOnce the candidate hits on the idea for selling products beyond gasoline, provide the following information. If the candidate does not immediately recognize the idea, guide him/her towards it.\nPart 2: Station A’s owner has been approached by a snack foods manufacturer. The snack manufacturer would like Station A to expand its station to accommodate a convenience store-type section that would sell junk food snacks and drinks (like a Mini-Mart). The manufacturer offers to construct the convenience store addition for $1.25 million. Station A’s owner would like your help in assessing the opportunity.\nAdditional Information\nAs the candidate explores the opportunity, he/she may ask for more information on the town, the station’s financials, etc. When asked, the interviewer may provide the following data.\na. Market Data\n• The town of Contrivedville currently has a population of 200 people.\n• The town’s population is not increasing or decreasing. It will remain flat at 200 forever.\n• There is no traffic flowing past the Stations from outside Contrivedville, so there are only 200 potential customers in the market.\n• Currently, people purchase gasoline from whichever station is closer, and we can assume that the town’s 200 residents are distributed evenly across the town.\n• There are two types of people who live in Contrivedville. Fit people and lazy people.\nb. Fit People Details\n• There are 100 fit people among the 200 Contrivedville residents.\n• They are equally distributed across the town.\n• They would never buy junk food, but they do buy gas.\nc. Lazy People Details\n• There are 100 lazy people among the 200 Contrivedville residents\n• They are equally distributed across the town.\n• They love junk food, and would go all the way across town to find it (because no stores currently sell junk food)\nd. Addition Offer Details\n• The $1.25 million encompasses all fixed costs of building and stocking the addition.\n• There are no variable costs to maintaining the addition, the snack food manufacturer re-stocks the addition every week, and there are no incremental labor costs.\ne. Financial Data\n• All Contrivedville residents spend an average of $30/week on gasoline.\n• Certain residents may spend $10/week on junk food products that could be sold through the new addition.\n• For the sake of this case, we can ignore the station’s margins and assume all the revenues are profits.\n• Station A’s owner has a personal discount rate of 10%.\nPossible Answer:\n1. Suggested Framework\nThe candidate may initially draw out the profitability framework:\nProfit = Revenue – Cost = (Volume * Price) – (Fixed Cost + Variable Cost)\n2. Analysis\nAfter the initial prompt, the candidate should brainstorm several potential ideas on how Station A can increase its revenue/profit. These ideas may include pricing, marketing, and product changes. Once the candidate suggests the possibility of adding additional products to the station, the opportunity is presented for the candidate to analyze.\nA good candidate will begin to gather information about the town and the opportunity in an effort to calculate whether the future cash flows of the addition outweigh the initial $1.25M expense.\nIn the course of asking for the information included above, the candidate should conclude that Station A currently has half the market share, earning $3,OOO/week from 100 customers purchasing gasoline only. With the addition, Station A will attract junk food spending from all 100 lazy Contrivedville customers, A good candidate will calculate the following:\n100 lazy customers * $10/week in junk food spending = $1,OOO/week, or $50,000 in annual income (assume a 50 week year)\nHowever, this ignores the gasoline spending of the 50 lazy customers now attracted to Station A. If the candidate does not initially recognize this, work to draw it out.\nInterviewer: The addition would attract the lazy customers to buy junk food. But is that all they would buy?\nThe candidate would then calculate the incremental revenue from the new 50 lazy fuel customers.\n50 customers * $30/week = $1,500/week, or $75,000 in additional annual fuel income.\n$50,000 in annual junk food income + $75,000 in incremental annual fuel income = $125,000/year\nA good candidate would recognize the $125,000 as the annual cash flow, which would be constant every year given our assumptions. At this point, the interviewer may remind the candidate how to value such a perpetual income stream.\nInterviewer: So the addition would net Station A $125,000 per year. How would you value that stream of cash flows?\nSome candidates may remember the valuation of perpetuity is simply the annual cash flow divided by the discount rate (10% as stated above). The candidate should then calculate:\nNPV = $125,000 / 10% = $1.25 million\nIf the candidate doesn’t know the valuation formula, provide them with it. The end result, with a present value equal to the value of future cash flows, may confuse the candidate. At this point, ask them for a final recommendation.\n3. Recommendation\nInterviewer: The client has asked us for our recommendation. What would you tell the client?\nThe candidate may or may not recommend building the addition. He may recommend building the addition to capture more customers, but they may also recommend avoiding the addition due to the execution risk of construction, potential cost overruns.\nRegardless of the recommendation, the interviewer should bring up Station B as a competitor and ask about competitive response to building or not building the addition.\nInterviewer: So based on your recommendation, how do you think Station B would respond if it had the same opportunity?\nIf the decision is made to build, press the candidate on what will happen if Station B builds an addition to gain its lazy customers back (which it will, because this is Contrivedville). If the candidate recommends against building, ask what will happen to Station A if Station B opens an addition and takes lazy customers away from station A.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: private equity & investment.\nConsulting Firm: Bain & Company 2nd round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: Food & Beverages.\nCase Interview Question #00956: The client Hillhouse Capital Group is a private equity firm founded in 2005. The PE firm manages capital for institutional clients such as university endowments, foundations, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and family offices. Hillhouse is a long-term fundamental research-driven equity investor. The PE firm focuses on the consumer, TMT, industrials and healthcare sectors and invests in companies across all equity stages. It invests globally, with a particular focus on China and Asia.\nThe Year is 2007. Our client Hillhouse Capital Group is looking at the baby formula market in China; in particular they are looking at a company called Super Jr.  Super Jr. is a local Chinese baby formula company that brands itself as a foreign company (it is considered a “local special company”). They advertise their products to be made and imported from Australia (which is true!). The PE firm client would like your help in determining whether Super Jr. is worth looking at.  What would you recommend?\nAdditional Information:\nIf the candidate asks for more information on the product, provide the following data.\n• Super Jr. is a relatively new startup founded in 2006.\n• They currently have no manufacturing capabilities and source their product “Super Jr. Formula” from an Australian manufacturer.\n• Super Jr. has spent a lot on marketing and has gained reputation as a “decent” brand in China.\n• Super Jr. primarily distributes to regional and local supermarkets. The supermarkets currently charges them a fee for stocking their product (for shelf space usage).\n• The management team at Super Jr. is composed of people who worked in the food sales and distribution industry.\n• The current growth strategy is to continue expanding distribution into national super-retail stores (Walmarts, Carrefour, etc.) while investing further in marketing to penetrate the high-end segment, allowing them to price at a premium.\nPossible Answer:\n1. Suggested Framework\nOpen ended case. No framework is necessary.\n2. Detailed Analysis\nProvide the following 4 Slides as the candidate requests the appropriate information. Ask the candidate to interpret the information on each slide and its implication for the client. On slides 1 and 2 the candidate should also answer the questions posed on the bottom of the slide.\nSlide 1. Baby Formula Market Historical Data\n\n• What does this graph tell you?\n• Assuming the same CAGR from 2000 to 2006, what would the market size be in 2012?\nSlide 2. Projected Growth from Super Jr.\n\n• What does this graph tell you?\n• Calculate the average CAGR between 2006 and 2012.\n• Is the projection realistic?\nSlide 3. Market Share by Company Type\n\nSlide 4. Key Stats by Company Type\n\n\nFactors\nMulti-Nationals\nLocal Established Brands\nSuper Jr.\n\n\nRetail Price\n $125\n $70\n $110\n\n\nProfit Margin \n30% \n15% \n15%\n\n\nRaw Materials \n12% \n27% \n45%\n\n\nManufacturing \n28% \n43% \n0%\n\n\nMarketing \n20% \n10% \n50%\n\n\nSG&A\n5% \n5% \n5%\n\n\nR&D \n35% \n15% \n0%\n\n\nPossible Answers:\nSlide 1: Market Growth Rate from 2001 – 2006\nThis graph shows that there has been steady growth annually at 20% a year. This is not bad for the baby formula industry considering that GDP in fast growing countries like China is around 9%.\nAt 20% CAGR a year, by 2012, the market should be at (1 + CAGR)^(Number of years) * Initial Amount, or (1 + 0.2)^6 * 9 = 27, or by estimate, it should be greater than (Growth Amount Per Year * Number of Years) + Initial, or (9 * 0.2 * 6) + 9 = 19.8 or approximately 20.\nSlide 2: Projected Growch Chart from 2006 – 2012\nThe chart indicates the Super Jr. is projected to grow from approximately $5MM to $60MM in the span of 6 years. From an estimation of CAGR, this is roughly (60 – 5)/6 = $9MM a year, or almost 150%. Extra points if the candidate writes out the CAGR formula of CAGR = (Ending Value / Beginning Value)^(1/# of years) – 1.\nThe candidate should notice that overall, Super Jr. is projecting very quick growth and their outlook is very optimistic compared to market growth. This means Super Jr. will have to outgrow the market by stealing competitor shares. How likely is this? From this graph, there is not enough information to tell. The candidate should ask for more information regarding to the following:\n• What are the core competencies of Super Jr. and how do they compare to competitors (sales, distribution, production)?\n• What particular segment does Super Jr. play in and is that segment easy to penetrate/steal shares?\n• What are the customers demanding and does Super Jr. do something that meets and exceeds their expectation?\nSlide 3: Market Share by Company Type\nUpon asking for more information about customer segments or competitive landscape, this slide should be given. It shows the following insights:\n• Super Jr. plays in the mid and mid – low market.\n• The premium markets are dominated by very few players whereas the local established market Super Jr. plays in is quite fragmented.\n• Momentum is not on Super Jr.’s side as it is in the premium segment.\n• In this slide, the candidate can use his/her intuition to argue for or against the future of Super Jr. For example:\n– Pro: Super Jr. has an established brand, so they can try to move upstream to premium market.\n– Con: There are very few players in the premium market, it might be difficult for Super Jr. to compete in that segment.\nSlide 4: Key Stats by Company Types\nAs you can see, Super Jr. spends most of their resources on marketing and none on R&D. The Candidate can argue both ways in the following manner.\n– Pro: Super Jr. has an advantage because the baby formula market is all about image and brand. With an emphasis on marketing, perhaps Super Jr. can make a good reputation for themselves.\n– Con: Super Jr. really doesn’t have any core competence and their model is probably not sustainable given that they really don’t have any R&D to compete in this market, especially in the premium market where parents may pay a lot of attention to R&D.\nOther conclusions based on general company information provided orally at the beginning of the case.\n• Again, here are more clues for the candidate to argue either way\n– Pro: Management team has sales experience which means maybe they can build Super Jr. into a very profitable brand with wide distribution network.\n– Pro: Super Jr. does not need to do R&D and as long as the Australian Manufacturer\nkeeps its quality high, Super Jr. might not have an issue.\n– Con: Super Jr. is too reliant on the Australia manufacturer and essentially does not have any core competence of its own. New entrants can easily do the same as Super Jr. is not establishing any real entry barriers to protect themselves.\n– Con: Moving into the premium market may be difficult as there are currently very dominant players.\n3. Recommendation\nIn all, this case is very open ended and really good arguments can be done either way as long as the candidate supports and sticks with their perspective. A strong candidate would argue and stick with their choice using solid support and wrap up the case in a clean and effective manner, without second guessing their choices while listing potential risks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: reduce costs.\nConsulting Firm: OC&C Strategy Consultants 2nd round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: industrial equipment; manufacturing.\nCase Interview Question #00957: Our client Karl Gilmore, long time CEO and the largest shareholder of Midwest Machinery Inc. (Midwest) is worried. Overall Midwest’s competitiveness has been slipping as it has been losing business more often to competitors due to price. Through benchmarking studies and some strategy consulting work, Karl knows that his cost structure is not competitive. As a result, he has been pushing his team over the last couple of months to find ways to reduce costs.\nMidwest Machinery makes a wide variety of machines designed specifically for the medium to heavy industrial sector that are used in everything from factories, farms, tractors and industrial buildings. Revenue is USD $3 Billion, with net profit margins around 12% (Note: net profit is $360M).\nThe CEO had demanded that management look for new ways to find cheaper ways  to produce machines. This research has pushed management to comb the globe for alternative suppliers in far away places such as Colombia, Shanghai and India.\nKarl has also been very demanding with regard to the processes that support all of the operations. In particular he wants to ensure basic activities that do not involve intellectual capital are performed at the lowest cost possible. In particular, he does not want to overpay for labor when it is not necessary. He respects Midwest’s traditions and the strong sense of community it has with the local town, but he knows that profitability must come first for him and his shareholders.\nPressing Issue:\nKarl’s Six Sigma team has come up with a proposal to move the manufacturing process for the XL292 machine, a critical machine for many of Midwest’s end products, to India. Also, these results may affect Karl’s decision on whether to outsource over $300M worth of costs. But before Karl looks at the financial data he wants to have a clear understanding of the pros and cons of outsourcing.\nCase Questions:\n1. Develop a structure for thinking through the pros and cons of outsourcing this manufacturing process to India. Your structure can only cover 5 topics that may or may not concern the business. You can only ask two questions before creating your structure. Explain this model and what you would advise Karl to consider as he reviews the data.\n2. After explaining your model, ask for the financial data and calculate the profitability of staying local vs. going abroad to India.\n3. Using the data, return to your model and explain how it has affected your thinking. You may ask three more questions at this point before concluding with your advice to Karl.\nAdditional Information: to give to candidate if asked \n• Community – Midwest Machinery is located in a small town in Midwest USA and has been the largest employer in that town for over 30 years.\n• Unions – Midwest Machinery is unionized but the union and management have typically been on friendly terms.\n• CEO Personal Incentive – If Karl saves the company over $50M this year, he will receive a $1M bonus.\n• Competitors – Their competitors have been outsourcing for years and benefiting by getting their costs down.\nPossible Answer:\n1. Suggested Framework\nLet the candidate drive the case. The candidate should, at this time, draw out a framework. The framework should include most of the major discussion topics in the chart below.\nGuide for Advising Karl. Use a simple structure to stay logical.\nA. Pros\n\n\n\n\nStay Local\nGo to India\n\n\n1. Financials, revenue, cost\nNone, reduced hassle in disposing of plant assets\nMost likely save money due to low labor costs and parts\n\n\n2. People\nLoyalty, best people stay, morale will be up\nEliminate low level jobs may force some people to try to advance and build their skills\n\n\n3. Plant operations\nCapacity should remain steady\nUnnecessary production may be streamlined resulting in more savings long term\n\n\n4. Community Relations\nUnions and community leaders will continue to support Midwest management\nNone\n\n\n5. Technology\nBy producing locally, Midwest can keep on top of technical changes quickly\nBy going abroad, Midwest will be exposed to better technology and may grow as a result.\n\n\n\nB. Cons\n\n\n\n\nStay Local\nGo to India\n\n\n1. Financials, revenue, cost\nMidwest will continue to waste profit dollars\nHidden costs in terms of handling product and dealing with a foreign country may be higher than expected\n\n\n2. People\nGood employees still may leave as personal opportunities diminish\nFearing for their jobs, good people may leave\n\n\n3. Plant operations\nOperations are not going to change and costs remain high\nIdle capacity may cause further expense in local plants\n\n\n4. Community relations\nNo problem\nBacklash from community may destroy value of company\n\n\n5. Technology\nNo problem\nCheaper prices may require cheaper technology as a result, higher capital expenditure.\n\n\n\n2.

Recommendations\nInterviewer: The client has asked us for our recommendation. What would you tell the client?\nHere is a possible response:\nThe savings for going abroad of about $1.3 million for XL292 machine is reachable. Based on the discussion of pros and cons of outsourcing to India, it may be a good idea to perform a pilot using the XL292 machine and make sure this part is successful before moving the $300 million worth of costs to India. It will be important to invest time in communicating frequently and openly with employees in order to keep motivation high. As for next steps, Karl can begin to craft a proposal for the XL292 machine pilot and to begin forecasting costs.\n4. Additional Considerations\nInterviewer: What are your concerns?\nHere are some examples:\n• Supplier charge – large savings may disappear.\n• Government changes – the taxes and credits may shift.\n• Hourly rate – may see a big shift in hours for India.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The chain has over 1,000 stores in shopping malls, strip malls, etc. They sell health and nutrition related products, including vitamins, dietary supplements, minerals, herbs, sports nutrition, diet, and energy products.\nShould your client Centre Lane Partners purchase Vitamin World?\nPossible Answer:\n1. How would you structure your analysis to help you make a recommendation?\nSuggested Structure:\n• Internal analysis of current customers\n• Market overview and competitive positioning\n• Customer trends survey – future opportunity identification\n• Value proposition development\n2. We want to find out what the annual impact on profit is if we increase the percentage of young men who are heavy users (ages 18-35) and who shop at Vitamin World from 30% to 35%.\nThe candidate should start by determining the market size of young men ages 18-35.\nTheir analysis/thought process should look like this:\n• U.S. Population = 300M\n• Male (50%) = 150M\n• Ages 18-35 (20%) = 30M\n• Heavy Users (1/3) = 10M\n• From 30% = 3M\n• To 35% = 3.5M\n• # of Increased Users = 3.5M – 3M = 0.5M\nWhen the candidate asks what our revenue streams look like, you can tell them the following data:\n• Each person spends $50/month on average.\nTheir calculations should look like:\n• 0.5M * $50 = $25M (incremental revenue per month)\n• $25M * 12 = $300M (incremental revenue per year)\nThe candidate should then ask what our cost are. Ask the candidate: what types of costs would you expect a health store to have?\nAfter they answer, tell them:\n• Let’s assume that their profit margin is 50%.\nThe candidate should calculate annual incremental profits = $300M * 50% = $150M per year.\n3. Walmart recently begins to sell the products that Vitamin World currently sells and is under pricing 75% of our\nproducts. Do you think this will affect Vitamin World’s performance?\nPotential Answers could include – It depends on the type of customers that shop at Vitamin World – if they are price sensitive they will probably go to Walmart, but if they like good customer service, they will continue to shop at Vitamin World.\n4. What other ways can we suggest our client to cut costs?\nSuggested Answers include:\n• Change suppliers – find low cost supplier\n• Minimize labor costs\n5. Recommendations\nAsk the candidate to wrap up the case.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: improve profitability.\nConsulting Firm: Roland Berger Strategy Consultants 2nd round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: office equipment.\nCase Interview Question #00964: Our client, Brother International Corporation, is a large manufacturer and seller of office appliances and peripherals. It is the U.S. subsidiary of Japanese multinational electronics and electrical equipment company Brother Industries, Ltd. Headquartered in Bridgewater, New Jersey, the company employs approximately 1,200 colleagues in the United States.\nBrother International is one of the leading firms in the market, with significant penetration and a devoted customer base that likes the firm for its advanced technology and great technical support staff. However, the firm has failed to meet its profitability goals, and is being criticized by investors and industry analysts. Brother International has engaged Roland Berger to help them with this issue. The two questions facing them are:\n1. What is/are the main driver(s) of their poor profitability?\n2. What possible steps could the company take to address these issue(s)?\nAdditional Information:\nIf the candidate asks for more information on the firm or their products, provide the following data.\nThe client Brother International specializes in making three products: printers, scanners, and fax machines, as well as peripherals for those machines, such as power cords, toner cartridges, etc. They currently sell their products directly to consumers, mostly small business users. Currently, each of their three products sells for $150, while each peripheral sells for $50.\nPossible Answer:\n1. Suggested Framework\nLet the candidate drive the case. The candidate should draw out a profitability framework and flesh out potential causes of poor profitability. Guide the candidate to the cost side of the profitability equation, and eventually get them to focus on customers.\nProfits = revenues – costs = (price * volume) – (fixed costs + variable costs).\nWhile the candidate may use the framework to generate ideas and hypotheses as to why profitability is declining, it may not be specifically useful in this case.\n2. Analysis\nThe client company isn’t sure why it can’t meet profitability goals, but they think it may have something to do with their customer base. They conducted a survey that’s given them a better sense of their 50M global customer base.\n• 60% of all their customers buy at least two products (meaning a scanner and a fax machine, or a printer and a scanner)\n• Of the portion of customers that purchases at least two products, one-third purchase all three products.\n• The remaining customers buy only one product.\n• With regard to peripherals, they are pretty integral to the machines. Every customer who buys at least two products also buys two peripherals, while a customer who purchases only one product only buys one peripheral.\nThe candidate should use this survey information to build a matrix of the different customer ‘types’ as illustrated in the chart below. Feel free to ask the candidate to compute any of the numbers included in the chart, as it will be helpful during the remainder of the case.\n\n\n\nTotal customers: 50M\nType A customer\nType B customer\nType C customer\n\n\n# of customers\n10M\n20M\n20M\n\n\n# of products purchased\n3\n2\n1\n\n\nPrice per product\n$150\n$150\n$150\n\n\nProduct revenue\n$450\n$300\n$150\n\n\n# of peripherals purchased\n2\n2\n1\n\n\nPrice per peripheral\n$50\n$50\n$50\n\n\nPeripheral revenue\n$100\n$100\n$50\n\n\nTotal revenue/customer\n$550\n$400\n$200\n\n\nTotal revenue/segment\n$5.5B\n$8B\n$4B\n\n\n\nAt this point, ask the candidate what they think about this information. Although they may try to jump right to profitability, try to get some preliminary hypothesis about what might be the problem or what the company might want to do given this customer base. Potential answers could include upselling Type ‘C’ customers, bundling, targeted marketing or other creative solutions.\nWith this information, guide the candidate to focus on profitability. The candidate may begin asking questions about the cost structure of the firm’s operations. Although this will not be part of the solution, feel free to ask candidates what kinds of information they would want or any hypotheses they may have.\nWe don’t have a lot of information on the cost structure of the firm’s manufacturing operations. The firm is a global leader in the space, so it’s safe to assume they have the most efficient manufacturing and distribution operations. We do know that the firm earns a 20% margin on each product it sells, as well as a 50% margin on peripherals.\nThe candidate may jump to the conclusion that the firm should sell more peripherals than products based on the margin discrepancy. But guide them to calculate the profits earned on each unit sold, as well as the profits for each customer type. The results of their calculations are illustrated in the table below:\n\n\n\nTotal customers: 50M\nType A customer\nType B customer\nType C customer\n\n\n# of customers\n10M\n20M\n20M\n\n\n# of products purchased\n3\n2\n1\n\n\nPrice per product\n$150\n$150\n$150\n\n\nMargin earned (20%)\n$90\n$60\n$30\n\n\n# of peripherals purchased\n2\n2\n1\n\n\nPrice per peripheral\n$50\n$50\n$50\n\n\nMargin earned (50%)\n$50\n$50\n$25\n\n\nTotal Margin/customer\n$140\n$110\n$55\n\n\n\nAt this point, the candidate may think the problem is clear, that a large percentage of customers aren’t very profitable. However, press the candidate to think if there are any possible costs that haven’t been accounted for. Remember, the client firm is known for its great technical support. This support comes at a significant cost.\nThe firm maintains call centers with support personnel. These employees are well trained and skilled. Unfortunately, they are also expensive. The firm estimates that each call answered and addressed by the staff costs the firm $25. The number of calls for each customer type also varies. Customers who purchase two or more products are generally more sophisticated and typically call support once. However, customers who purchase only one product often rely on them for many issues, calling them an average of three times.\nThis makes the profitability of each customer much different, as illustrated in the chart below:\n\n\n\nTotal customers: 50M\nType A customer\nType B customer\nType C customer\n\n\n# of customers\n10M\n20M\n20M\n\n\nTotal Margin/customer\n$140\n$110\n$55\n\n\nService calls/customer\n1\n1\n3\n\n\nTotal service costs\n($25)\n($25)\n($75)\n\n\nTotal Profit/customer\n$115\n$85\n($20)\n\n\n\n3. Solution\nA good candidate will take the initial information regarding product lines and work to figure out how many units are sold and how profitable the firm is. With the customer survey information, he/she should be able to ascertain the total firm revenues ($5.5+$8+$2 = $15.5 Billion) and revenues by segment as illustrated in the matrix presented above.\nFollowing this information, the candidate may look to learn about the cost structure of the firm and whether that has changed significantly. With only the margins to go on, the candidate should be able to calculate margins for each customer segment, but may be unsure how to proceed.\nIt is important to ask the candidate if they have considered all potential costs, particularly if they begin to make recommendations. Once the service costs are given, the candidate should have no problem arriving at the conclusion that the Type ‘C’ level customers actually cost the firm money due to their service needs. At that point, the interviewer may ask the candidate for possible solutions.\n4. Recommendations\nInterviewer: The client has asked us for our recommendation. What would you tell the client?\nHere is a possible response:\nThe client firm’s profitability issues stem from customers who don’t generate substantial revenue but impose substantial costs through their service needs. Although they generate $2 billion in revenue (Type C), ultimately the firms lose $400 million on these customers. There are a number of potential solutions to the problem, which include increasing their revenue, decreasing their service costs, or changing the service model.\nThe candidates may think of many options to address the issue, such as:\n• Charging customers to receive technical support.\n• Creating other service options (web knowledge base, email support, etc) that are more cost effective for simple problems.\n• Replace expensive customer service representatives with cheaper alternatives for the low profitability customer segment.\n• Bundle products to make low-value customers profitable.\n5. Additional Considerations\nInterviewer: What are some of the potential risks?\nHere are some potential answers:\n• Any change to the company’s service model may hurt the brand identity.\n• Would customers switch providers if they know service will cost them?\n• Would changes to cater to low-value customers hurt the higher value customers?\n• Working to increase revenue from low-value customers may not succeed.\n• Survey data that we’ve based these assumptions on may not be accurate.\n• There may be other reasons behind profitability concerns that we have not yet explored.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: improve profitability; operations strategy, optimization.\nConsulting Firm:  Boston Consulting Group (BCG) first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: conglomerate; manufacturing.\nCase Interview Question #00965: Our client The 3M Company, formerly known as the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company (1902 – 2002), is an American multinational conglomerate corporation based in Maplewood, Minnesota, a suburb of St. Paul. 3M employs 88,000 people worldwide and produces more than 55,000 products,  including: adhesives, abrasives, laminates, passive fire protection, dental and orthodontic products, electronic materials, medical products, and optical films.\nAs a large conglomerate, the client 3M has various business divisions and the division we are working with makes pressure sensitive self adhesive canvases for sign boards. This division has seen revenues stagnate over the past few years and profitability has declined. 3M has engaged Boston Consulting Group (BCG) to help them with this issue. The two questions facing them are:\n1. How to restore profitability for the pressure sensitive self adhesive canvas division?\n2. Should we improve our delivery channel?\nAdditional Information: \nIf the candidate asks for more information on the product, provide the following info.\nTo understand what the product is, think of any signboard that you see. One part of the signboard is the metallic posts that holds the board up, and upon that board you can stick our client’s product. 3M’s customers buy blank canvases from 3M, print their signs onto the canvas and then simply paste the canvas over sign boards, just like you would paste a normal sticker.\nThe figure below is only for the interviewer’s understanding. This should NOT be shared with the candidate.\n\nLet the candidate drive the case. The candidate should, at this time, draw out a framework. Here is some of the information that a candidate may ask for. Provide this only if the candidate asks.\nMore about the client 3M:\n• 3M is among the largest market share holders in the pressure sensitive self adhesive canvas market.\n• 3M supplies the entire U.S.\n• 3M has been in this industry for a long time and hence, has an established brand.\n• 3M has grown through acquisitions and has a few manufacturing plants that it has acquired.\n• Assume that there is only one kind of product in the client’s product mix. There are no opportunities to change this.\n• As far as distribution goes, the client has already asked us whether we should look at improving our distribution channels.\nMore about the Market:\n• There are 2 other big players. 3M and each of the two big players have about 25% of the market each. The rest is fragmented.\n• The market is growing at 3% (A good candidate should be able to figure out that this must be an industry that is growing as fast at the GDP)\n• Our competitors’ products are very similar to ours and are priced similarly too. Our competitors do not have any differentiation when it comes to the product, promotions, or price.\nPossible Answer:\n1. Suggested Framework\nProfits = revenues – costs = (price * volume) – (fixed costs + variable costs)\nHere is the information that can be provided to the candidate for the above framework:\n• The division’s revenue has stagnated at about $100M.\n• The price has not changed. There are no opportunities to increase or decrease price.\n2. Analysis\nWhen the candidate discusses costs, provide Exhibit 1.\nExhibit 1: 3M “pressure sensitive self adhesive canvas division” Income Statement (in $ million)\n\n\n\nYear\n2012\n2013\n2014\n\n\nRevenue\n100\n101\n101\n\n\nCOGS\n40\n42\n42\n\n\nContribution\n60\n59\n59\n\n\nManufacturing Cost\n40\n44\n49\n\n\nSG&A\n15\n14\n15\n\n\nNet Income\n5\n1\n(5)\n\n\n\nIf, after seeing Exhibit 1, the candidate asks about the manufacturing costs, provide Exhibit 2. If the candidate does not ask about manufacturing costs, drive the candidate towards manufacturing costs and then provide Exhibit 2.\nExhibit 2: 3M “pressure sensitive self adhesive canvas division” Manufacturing Cost Details\n\n\n\nYear\n2012\n2013\n2014\n\n\nTotal volume (yards)\n50M\n50M\n50M\n\n\nAverage run length (yards)\n1,000\n750\n500\n\n\nYards of material produced per minute\n25\n25\n25\n\n\nAverage set-up time for each run (minutes)\n20\n20\n20\n\n\n# of employees\n100\n110\n120\n\n\n# of over time hours per employee per year\n100\n200\n300\n\n\nInventory Turns\n8\n9\n10\n\n\n\nAlong with Exhibit 2, provide the following information:\nThe product is sold by the yard. The way the process works is that the raw materials are fed into the machine for a pre-set run length (run-length = length of canvas produced in the run). The machine runs for that period, generates the pre-set amount of canvas, and then stops and needs to be set up again for the next run.\nA good candidate will notice that 3M has produced the same length of canvas per year. However, their average run length has been decreasing, number of employees increasing and the employee overtime hours increasing. The inventory turns has been increasing too. You may provide the following information if the candidate asks related information:\n• 3M has heard about inventory management and they have learned that a high inventory turn is generally good for the company.\n• Inventory turn = total volume / average inventory (at this point, good candidates will infer that the average inventory has been decreasing).\n• 3M has sought to increase inventory turns because they feel that the demand in the market for these canvases is uncertain. So, they are unwilling to keep inventory indefinitely.\nIf the candidate asks about why the client feels that the market demand is uncertain, say that that’s what a different consulting firm has told them. Good candidates will want to go deeper into understanding this. Tell them that the product can be kept in inventory for long periods and 3M already has the capability to store them. Candidates should infer that the decrease in run lengths was done to reduce inventory, but it has in turn caused inefficiencies in the manufacturing process.\nInterviewer: How inefficient is 3M today in comparison to 2012?\nThe candidate should calculate this:\nIn 2012, an average run took 1,000/25 = 40 mins. The set up time was 20 mins. Thus, total time = 60 mins to produce 1,000 yards. –> 1,000/60 = 16.67 yards per minute\nIn 2014, an average run took 500/25 = 20 mins. The set up time was 20 mins. Thus, total time = 40 mins to produce 500 yards. –> 500/40 = 12.5 yards per minute\nTo produce 1,000 yards in 2014, 3M will need 1,000/12.5 = 80 minutes, i.e. 33% more than that in 2012. So, 3M’s efficiency has gone down 33% as a result of the ‘supposed’ improvements in inventory turns.\nIf a candidate asks if it is possible to produce at more than 1,000 yards run lengths, tell them that it is possible to go up to 1,500 yards per run.\nAt 1,500 yards per run, an average run will take 1,500/25 = 60 mins. The set up time is 20 mins. Thus, total time = 80 mins to produce 15,00 yards. –> 1,500/80 = 18.75 yards per minute, which is a 50% improvement over our 2014 results (12.5) and a 12.5% improvement over our 2012 results (16.67).\nAt this point, the candidate should move into the question on distribution channels. If the candidate is still working on profitability, guide the candidate towards the distribution issue.\nProvide this additional information if asked:\n• Currently, 3M works with two distributors who sell the canvases to end customers. One distributor is based on the west coast and another on the east coast. Customers generally prefer distributors close to them in terms of time zone.\n• Our competition uses several distributors.\n• The distributors (be it for 3M or for competition) work on standard percentage of sales.\n• Most distributors are open to stocking multiple brands.\nThe candidate should deduce that 3M should engage more distributors in other regions in the US to ensure that sales grow at the rate of growth of the industry.\n3. Recommendations\nInterviewer: The client has asked us for our recommendation. What would you tell the client?\nHere is a possible response:\nOur profitability has gone down because we have reduced our average run length from 1,000 yards to 500 yards. This has reduced our efficiency by 33%. To restore profitability, 3M should aim to increase run lengths to the maximum of 1,500 yards per run. This will increase their efficiency by 50% over 2014 results and by 12.5% over 2012 results. Further, we should also engage more distributors in geographically diverse regions of the U.S. so our customers may be able to source the canvases more easily. This will allow us to regain our growth and start growing at the market growth rate again.\n4. Additional Considerations\nInterviewer: What are some of the potential risks?\nHere are some potential answers:\n• We will need to fire some employees. This may result in a loss of goodwill and may create some bad press.\n• Running machines at capacity may result in more wear and tear, resulting in added maintenance expenditure.\n• Engaging new distributors may make our existing distributors unhappy.\n• 3M will need to spend resources to find new distributors and to find ways to get the canvases to them.\n• 3M can also explore reductions in their inventory holding costs (less manpower, less inventory storage space) to realize the benefits of increased inventory turns. The reduction of these costs may be enough to compensate for increases in manufacturing costs, but we need further analysis to confirm this.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: organizational behavior.\nConsulting Firm: KPMG Advisory first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage:  software, information technology (IT).\nCase Interview Question #00966: Our client is Mr. Jeff Weiner, the CEO of IT company LinkedIn Corporation (NYSE: LNKD). LinkedIn is a business-oriented social networking service. Founded in December 14, 2002 and launched on May 5, 2003, it is mainly used for professional networking. Mr. Jeff Weiner feels that there are some redundancies in his company. So he wants to find out the following:\n• Where are the people?\n• What are they doing?\n• What are their skill sets?\nTo help with this, he got help from KPMG Advisory to make a spreadsheet survey that will contain all this information for all the company’s employees. He also got KPMG Advisory to write an instruction sheet on how to fill up the spreadsheet survey. There are 9 layers in LinkedIn Corporation:\nLayer 1: CEO\nLayer 2: VPs\nLayers 3-8: Other Managers\nLayer 9: Employees\nThere are 10 VPs and 1,800 people in all in the organization. Assume it takes 30 minutes to read the instruction sheet and 3 minutes to fill information about each person in the spreadsheet survey.\nThere are three options for the CEO to conduct the redundancy survey:\nA. Send the survey and instructions to the 10 VPs who will complete the survey and send it back to the CEO.\nB. There are 360 people with people management roles in the organization. These 360 people will fill up the survey for all their direct reports.\nC. Choose 60 managers who will fill up the information for 30 people each.\nThis is just a starting point for the complete redundancy study. Which of these 3 ways do you recommend the client to use?\nAdditional Information: \nAll relevant information is provided in the outlining of the case.\nPossible Answer:\n1. Suggested Framework\nThe candidate should calculate the total time required for each option. For purposes of this case all individuals time is considered equally valuable although a strong candidate will point out that some adjustment should be considered for the fact that managers time is more valuable then workers.\n2. Detailed Analysis\nOption A: Send the survey and instructions to the 10 VPs who will complete the survey and send it to the CEO:\n• Each VP spends 30 minutes reading the instructions.\n• Total time to read instructions: 10 x 30 = 300 minutes\n• There are a total of 1,800 employees, and for each employee, 3 minutes are required on the survey.\n• Total time to fill the survey: 1,800 x 3 = 5,400 minutes\n• Total time required: 300 + 5,400 = 5,700 minutes = 95 hours\nOption B: There are 360 people with people management roles in the organization. These 360 people will fill up the survey for all their direct reports:\n• Each person with people management responsibility spends 30 minutes reading the instructions.\n• Total time to read instructions: 360 x 30 = 10,800 minutes\n• There are a total of 1,800 employees, and for each employee, 3 minutes are required on the survey.\n• Total time to fill the survey: 1800 x 3 = 5,400 minutes\n• Total time required: 10,800 + 5,400 = 16,200 minutes = 270 hours\nOption C: Choose 60 managers who will fill up the information for 30 people each:\n• Each manager spends 30 minutes reading the instructions.\n• Total time to read instructions: 60 x 30 = 1,800 minutes\n• There are a total of 1,800 employees, and for each employee, 3 minutes are required on the survey.\n• Total time to fill the survey: 1800 x 3 = 5,400 minutes\n• Total time required: 1,800 + 5,400 = 7,200 minutes = 120 hours\nAt this point, the candidate may jump to the conclusion that option A is the best. Stop them from concluding and get them to think further. Ask: Is time the only factor that will decide which method you will use?\nCandidates should, at this point, start thinking on the lines of why this survey was being done. Time is a good factor, but it’s also important to get the right data from the study. Once the candidate mentions the data quality issue move on to the recommendation and conclusion.\n3. Recommendations\nInterviewer: So let’s talk about the merits and demerits of the three methods to help us decide which method to pick. Let’s find 2 merits and 2 demerits of each method.\nA good candidate will draw a table similar to the one shown below. Get the candidate to think of the merits and demerits and write them down.\n\n\n\n\nOption A\nOption B\nOption C\n\n\nMerit\n\n\nMinimum Overhead of 95 hours.\nEasy to communicate the reasons and instructions for the survey.\n\n\n\n\nPeople have great knowledge about the people that they are writing for. Great accuracy.\nThere is no chance of cooking the books.\n\n\n\n\nPeople have good knowledge about the people that they are writing for. Good (albeit not the best) accuracy.\nThere is no chance of cooking the books.\n\n\n\n\nDemerit\n\n\nVPs have limited knowledge about people several levels below them. Thus, accuracy is limited.\nThere is a chance that the VPs will cook the books to get data that they prefer.\n\n\n\n\nMaximum overhead of 270 hours.\nDifficult to communicate the reasons and instructions for the survey.\nDifficult to gather the collected information back in a timely fashion.\n\n\n\n\nDifficult to communicate the reasons and instructions for the survey.\nDifficult to gather the collected information back in a timely fashion. But not as difficult as method B.\nHigher overhead of 120 hours.\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewer: Based on these merits and demerits, what recommendation would you give the client?\nPossible Response:\nI recommend the client to choose method C. This method, while about 25% more time consuming than method A, is far better (about 60%) than method B in terms of turnaround time. Method C gives us a good understanding of what the people in the organization are doing. Given the problem at hand is just a starting point for finding where some redundancies may lie, it is sufficient to have a good idea and not the deepest detail as method B would give. Method C also removes the risk of the books being cooked. So, this method is the most efficient way to get to the information needed.\n4. Additional Considerations\nInterviewer: If time allows, ask the candidate to list additional considerations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Please note that some of this information is key to solving the case and if the candidate does not delve into it, this information should NOT be provided willingly at all.\nMore about the new product:\n• The portable generator set product is typically used by the trucking industry.\n• When the trucks are powered off, i.e. they are in the rest areas and the engine is idle, the trucks use generators to cool the inside of the cabin when the driver naps or relaxes. The generators typically power portable refrigerators, air-conditioning/heating of the driver cabin, TV and entertainment units etc.\n• The existing options in the market include diesel powered generators.\n• Diesel generators run using diesel and give out the familiar strong smelling stench. They are definitely not environment friendly. They also run making a large amount of noise.\n• Our new product is better than diesel generators on both the above respects. Our generators are silent and because we don’t run on diesel, our generators have no smell. Our generators however need to be charged prior to use and typically need 4 hours of truck running to charge fully.\n• The truck drivers can also choose to leave the engine running and use the engine to cool the cabin, power entertainment units etc. However, in this case the truck will be consuming gas.\nPossible Answer:\n1. Suggested Framework\nThe candidate should, at some point, draw out a framework. Note: this is just an example and is not intended to be comprehensive. Here are some things to consider:\na. Market Sizing/Demand:\n• Trucks sold that would require a generator\n• Customer segments\n• Customer needs\n• Growth rate\nb. Competition/Substitutes:\n• Substitutes\n• Cost/benefit analysis\n• Market share of competitors\nc. External considerations:\n• Environmental issues\n• Patent protection\n• Competitive reaction\n2. Detailed Analysis\nThe candidate at this point should be asked to calculate the market size.\nNote to Interviewer: You can either provide the data below or let the candidate make assumptions (that you can validate) depending on stage of case preparation.\nThere are 10,000 trucks being sold in the U.S. on an average daily. Of these 60% of the trucks are designed used for long-distance travel. The generators will be a feature that will be wanted by the long-distance drivers since they will be making the rest areas stops and needing power during the break.\nOf the old trucks sold, there are none that can have this product installed now, so they are not a potential market.\nThus, average market size in the U.S. = 60% * 10,000 * 30 = 180K trucks/month\nSince there is no other company that has the same product we can safely assume that we can capture this entire market if (a) we can meet demand estimates with production capacity and (b) we conclude that the entire potential market will appreciate and value our product features and not take to any of the substitutes.\nThe candidate should then move to address if the second assumption is indeed true. Guide the candidate towards the question.\nGood candidates will want to go deeper into understanding this. The objective of this exercise is to do a cost-benefit analysis of the options and see which option the truckers would prefer.\nAt this point, the candidate can be provided with the below information if asked.\nAdditional Information:\nOption A. The battery operated generator will be sold:\n• For $15,000 a unit\n• It is costless to charge the generator since it charges during the run time of the truck and does not cost gas or any other resources.\n• The generator has a useful life of 5 years and a zero salvage value.\n• The generators are used for 40 hours a month on an average.\n• The generators can run for a stretch of 10 hours when fully charged.\nOption B. The diesel sets:\n• Cost $12,000 a set and have zero salvage value.\n• They last for 5 years as well.\n• Every hour of the diesel generator costs a gallon of diesel that sells for $2.50 a gallon\nOption C. Leaving the truck on is also on option:\n• It would cost a gallon of gas on an average to power the standard units for 0.5 hours. Gas costs $4 a gallon.\nOne possible approach to the cost-benefit analysis is shown below.\n• Assume that the trucker makes a rest area stop for 10 hours and compare the cost-benefit of each option around that.\n• We break the costs into fixed costs and variable costs. We amortize the cost of the unit over the number of hours it will last and calculate the fixed costs.\n• We use the run time of 10 hours to find what the variable costs will look like. You could also do this on a per hour basis. The key is to pick a simple basis for comparison and add the fixed cost to the analysis.\n• We compare the total cost for each of the options and note that the client’s generators are financially the cheapest option available to the truckers.\n\n\n\nOptions\nOption A: Use the client generators\nOption B: Use diesel generators\nOption C: Leave truck running on gas\n\n\nFixed cost (per 10 hours)\n$15,000/(12 month/year * 5 years * 40 hour/month) * 10 hours = $62.5\n$12,000/(12 month/year * 5 years * 40 hour/month) * 10 hours = $50\n0\n\n\nVariable cost (per 10 hours)\n0\n$2.5 * 10 = $25\n$4 * (10/0.5) = $80\n\n\nTotal cost\n$62.5\n$75\n$80\n\n\n\nAny other creative ideas are also to be rewarded. The idea is to see that the candidate can think on the fly and think of the potential benefits and cost that might impact the recommendation.\n3. Recommendations\nInterviewer: The client has asked us for our recommendation. What would you tell the client?\nHere is a possible response:\n1. There is a steady demand for the product at about 180K units per month and we can capture a large share of the demand with the right advertising and manufacturing capacity.\n2. We should look to educate the buyers of the benefits of our product – clearly both financially and environmentally we are much better than our competition/substitutes.\n3. Potential risks include competitors copying the concept and the high upfront cost of purchasing the product.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: increase sales/revenues.\nConsulting Firm: Oliver Wyman first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: household goods, consumer products.\nCase Interview Question #00968: Our client Sun Products Inc. is a prominent manufacturer of household cleaning products such as soap, laundry detergent, hand wash gel, etc. With annual sales of USD $3 billion, the company’s products are sold under many popular brands that include All, Wisk, Snuggle, Sun, Surf, and Sunlight.\nCurrently, the client Sun Products holds the third largest market share in the $20 billion North American household cleaning market. They feel that an opportunity may exist for them to do better in the market. They have tasked your consulting firm to help them with this. As one of the consultants working on this case, what will be some of the first things that you will ask the client?\nPossible Answer:\n1. Suggested Framework\nThere can be many possible answers here. Drive the candidate to ask: What is meant by ‘doing better in the market’? At this point, ask the candidate: What do you think that may mean?\nPossible replies may include ‘have stronger growth’, ‘occupy bigger market share’, ‘be more profitable’, etc. The interviewer can choose to ask deeper questions (“What else?”) to judge the depth of the candidate’s understanding of the problem. Possible questions may include:\n• What is a good growth rate in this industry?\n• What can a company do to increase market share?\nEventually, drive the candidate to draw out the profitability framework: Profits = Revenue – Cost = (Volume * Price) – (Fixed cost + Variable Cost)\nRevenues: made up of Volume and Price\nCost: made up of Fixed cost and Variable cost\nThere may be many products in the client’s product mix.\n2. Gathering Information\nOnce the candidate presents the profitability framework, say: This looks like a good place to start our analysis. What questions will you ask our client to help you get the information you require?\nGive the following information (It is preferred that the candidate asks for this information. If not, drive the candidate towards the information. Give it away as a last resort to ensure progress in the case.)\n• Revenues in the last year: USD $3 Billion\n• Client’s product mix: Dish washing powder, Clothes detergent powder, Hand wash liquid, Shower gel, All-purpose soap.\n• There are no opportunities in cost savings or in adding new products to the current product mix.\nBy this time, the candidate should realize that the only way to increase profitability is to get an increase in revenues. If the candidate does not realize this even after getting the above information, tell the candidate to focus on the revenue side of the framework.\n3. Detailed Analysis\nInterviewer: How can we increase revenues?\nRevenues = Price * Volume. The candidate should figure out that this can be done by raising prices or increasing volumes. Good candidates will talk about price elasticity at this point. Show the candidate the following table:\nInterviewer: Based on the ideas you just mentioned, our consulting team conducted a market research study. Our research has shown that if the prices of their products are changed all at once in the percentages shown in the following table, the volumes of the products sold will remain unchanged. It is important to note that the changes in price either happen all at once or none at all.\nTable 1: Market research on price elasticity. To be given to the candidate\n\n\n\nProduct\nIf product’s price is changed by this %, market research shows that the volume will remain same\n% of revenues (Current)\n\n\nDish Washing Powder\n-2%\n5%\n\n\nClothes Detergent Powder\n1%\n20%\n\n\nHand wash liquid\n0\n30%\n\n\nShower gel\n2%\n30%\n\n\nAll-purpose soap\n4%\n15%\n\n\n\nInterviewer: The client has told us that they will be happy with a 1% increase in revenues. Should they go ahead with the price change as the table above recommends?\nCandidates will use the information in this table and the information about last year’s revenue ($3 Billion) to calculate the following figures:\nTable 2: Calculations of Revenues after price change\n\n\n\nProduct\nCurrent revenue ($ million)\nRevenue after price change ($ million)\n\n\nDish Washing Powder\n$3B * 5% = $150M\n$150M * 98% = $147M\n\n\nClothes Detergent Powder\n$3B * 20% = $600M\n$600M * 101% = $606M\n\n\nHand wash liquid\n$3B * 30% = $900M\n$900M\n\n\nShower gel\n$3B * 30% = $900M\n$900M * 102% = $918M\n\n\nAll-purpose soap\n$3B * 15% = $450M\n$450M * 104% = $468\n\n\nTotal\n$3B\n$3.039B\n\n\n\n3. Recommendation & Other Considerations\nBased on the above, after the price change, the revenue will be $3.039 billion, i.e. an increase of $39 million. The client’s target was 1% increase, i.e. $30 million. So, the candidate should recommend that the client go ahead with the price change as reflected by market research.\nInterviewer: Is there anything that our client should watch out for?\nSome possible responses:\n• Competition’s moves may undermine our price changes.\n• Are we a monopoly producer? If so, we may invite anti-trust suits by price increases.\n• There is a risk that the market research was not reflective of all the geographies that our client supplies its products.\n• This is a one-time increase in revenues. The client cannot expect to continue raising prices to keep a steady top-line growth.\n• We have only analyzed revenues. There may be some additional cost associated with the price increase (such as advertising to explain the price increase) that may eat into the profits generated through the $39 million additional revenue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: improve profitability.\nConsulting Firm:  Roland Berger Strategy Consultants first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: energy industry; utilities.\nCase Interview Question #00969: Our client MidAmerican Energy Company (MEC) is an electricity company based in Des Moines, Iowa. Its service area includes almost two-thirds of Iowa, as well as portions of Illinois, South Dakota, and Nebraska. Here are a few concepts about electricity generation that will help you through this case.\nThere are several ways to produce electricity:\n• Water\n• Coal fired power plants\n• Nuclear\n• Wind\nThese are some other facts about the electricity industry in US:\n• Electricity can be supplied to a wholesaler or to consumers directly.\n• Electricity transmission is highly regulated (because the wires used to transport electricity are mostly government controlled). However, electricity usage is mostly deregulated, i.e. the government does not set the price. Instead, the price is set by competitive forces.\nOur client MEC has 10 plants that produce electricity using coal. The client obtains coal partly from their own coal mines and partly from 3rd party coal providers. Off late, the client has seen the profitability from their coal generated electricity decline. What could be causing this?\nPossible Answer:\n1. Suggested Framework\nThe candidate should take some time to summarize the issue and to process the above information. The appropriate framework to address this issue is the profitability framework:\nProfits = Revenue – Cost = (Volume * Price) – (Fixed cost + Variable Cost)\n2. Gathering Information\nAs the candidate goes through the various parts of the above profitability framework, share the following information. Wait for the candidate to ask for this, but share the information even if the candidate does not explicitly ask.\na. Volume\n• MEC supplies electricity to over a million customers (a customer is a household or a business) in deregulated markets through wholesalers.\n• Volume is generated by demand. The market is fragmented and MEC supplies electricity through wholesalers.\n• The market is growing at about 3% per annum.\nb. Price\n• This is a deregulated industry. Price is set by competitive forces.\n• There is one constant price that applies throughout the year (i.e. no peak pricing, etc.)\n• As a simplification, consider that the some price is charged to all customers, be they residential or industrial.\nGood candidates will deduce that since the market sets the price and this is a mature industry, currently the supply meets all the demands, i.e. there is not much opportunity in terms of volume and price.\nc. Fixed Cost\n• The client MEC runs 10 plants around the US.\n• MEC pays a fixed cost to lease transmission lines to transmit the electricity produced.\nd. Variable Cost\n• As a simplification, consider the main raw material to be coal.\n3. Detailed Analysis\nThe candidate should consider looking deeper into the cost side (because it was already deduced that there aren’t any opportunities in the revenue side).\nInterviewer: Let’s explore the cost side in more detail. A simplified supply chain for electricity consists of 3 parts:\nAcquiring the coal –> Generating the electricity –> Transmitting the electricity\nWhat potential issues may lie in each of the above 3 parts?\nAllow the candidate to brainstorm at least 3 potential issues for each of the above issues. Prompt the candidate to brainstorm more by persistently asking “What else?” after each response till the candidate provides at least 3 issues for each part of the supply chain.\nNote that this case is about brainstorming and generating ideas and not about numbers.\nHere are some possible responses that candidates may provide:\nI. Acquiring the coal\n• The coal may have to be transported across some distance. This could be done through rail or road. There are potential savings here in optimizing the transport channel.\n• The coal is received from several sources: MEC’s own coal mines and 3rd party mines. The quality of coal (its energy content) is likely to be different in different mines. Hence, processing different type of coal probably takes different processes and machines. This diversity could be a potential cost generator and this could be handled by sourcing for more similar coal varieties.\n• The coal mines could be in a geographically separate region, subjecting MEC’s coal supply to other regions’ risks (e.g., climatic factors such as hurricanes, political turmoil, etc.)\n• The coal mines are probably unionized, and that may add to volatility in our coal supply.\nII. Generating the electricity\n• The electricity generators may be old and not functioning as efficiently, inducing waste in the system.\n• There are 10 different plants in the client’s company. Differences in operations of these plants may induce volatility in the system.\n• The availability of labor may have changed by the arrival of other industry or competitors in our plants’ vicinity.\n• Given that MEC generates electricity through coal, some new environmental laws may have come into force increasing the cost of electricity generation.\nIII. Transmitting the electricity\n• Transmission could be streamlined by finding more customers closer to the electricity plants themselves.\n• MEC could look into a bandwidth sharing contract so that their lease may be cheaper.\n• MEC can look into checking the transmission lines for repairs etc that may be required so that there is less electricity loss in transmission.\nInterviewer: MEC is primarily an electricity generating company. Do you think they should keep the coal mine?\nAdditional Information:\nHere is some information that can be shared with the candidate if the candidate asks for it.\n• MEC gets coal at 30% cheaper rates when it gets coal from its own coal mines as compared to 3rd party coal mines.\n• There is a large market for coal. Coal customers are diverse, electricity producers are just one of many. As a simplification, assume that all coal customers pay the same market price for coal when they purchase coal from coal mines.\nWith the above info, candidates may be tempted to deduce that MEC should keep the coal mine because they get coal cheaper from their own coal mine. If candidates say this, remind them that:\nInterviewer: Yes, MEC is getting coal cheaper from their coal mines. But they can also sell the same coal to other customers and make the same profit. So what is the advantage of using the coal for their electricity generation operation?\nPotential responses are:\n• Having their own coal mine reduces supplier power for MEC. MEC’s electricity generation operations have the advantage of encountering lesser volatility in the supply of their core raw material, coal. MEC can control the coal production and can hence have lesser volatility in coal quality and labor issues.\n• MEC’s business is more diversified through the coal mining operation.\nInterviewer: On an average, MEC operates at 80% utilization. MEC’s CEO saw this statistic and asked your consulting team if he should look into increasing the utilization from 80% to 90%. How would you approach this problem? By the way, the industry average is to operate at 77% utilization.\nTell the candidate that the demand for electricity is cyclical. Ask the candidate what that might imply.\nPossible response:\nCandidates should point out that that means there are peaks and troughs in electricity demand (e.g., air conditioners working over time during summer). As an electricity company, MEC is committed to meet the peak demand and so, it is normal to operate at less than 100% utilization. MEC is already operating at close to the industry average and it may be unrealistic to expect the utilization to increase to 90%.\n4. Recommendation\nInterviewer: The CEO of MEC would like to hear a summary of our analysis. Please provide a final recommendation.\nPossible response:\nGood candidates will take a minute or two to gather their thoughts. The initial question was about what might be causing the decline in profitability of coal generated electricity. Candidates should be able to point out that this is a cost issue. Specifically, candidates should talk briefly about the supply chain analysis, showing potential issues and cost saving opportunities. Candidates should also recommend continuing the use of MEC’s own coal mine and ignoring pressure to increase utilization to 90%.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "title": "AMEX Considers Dropping Charge Card Annual Fee",
        "url": "http://www.consultingcase101.com/amex-considers-dropping-charge-card-annual-fee/",
        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: market sizing; math problem.\nConsulting Firm: Capital One first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: Financial Services.\nCase Interview Question #00970: The American Express Company (Amex) is a multinational financial services corporation headquartered in Manhattan’s Three World Financial Center in New York City, United States. The company provides a variety of services to its card holders, and is best known for its credit card, charge card, and traveler’s cheque businesses.\nIts primary service is its well-known charge card that enables “members” (i.e., card holders) to purchase goods and services from millions of merchants that accept the Amex card. Unlike other credit cards, Amex charge card holders are required to pay off their accrued balances each month, and interest is not charged.\nRecently, Amex has faced strong competition from new credit cards entering the market. They have considered dropping the $55 annual fee for their charge cards. Amex has engaged our firm to answer two questions:\n1. What are the economics of such a decision?\n2. Should the fee be dropped or not?\nPossible Answer:\n1. Suggested Framework\n• Determine how American Express makes money.\n• Evaluate the pros and cons of dropping the annual fee.\n• Explore options for replacement revenue.\n• Make a recommendation.\n2. Gathering Information\nThe following data should be given to interviewee when they ask. Encourage the interviewee to establish estimates.\nAdditional Information:\n• Revenue from annual fee = $55 * the number of card members (round to $50 for simpler math)\n• The number of cardholders is approximately 14 million (you can round to either 10M or 20M to simplify the math) – Encourage the interviewee to estimate this number on their own.\n• No additional revenues from consumers, since balances are paid monthly. (Amex doesn’t enforce late fees)\n• 1% merchant fees for transactions from merchants honoring Amex card.\n• Estimated annual transactions are $1,000 per cardholder. (Annual merchant-transaction revenue = $1,000 * 1% * 10M = $100 million)\n3. Detailed Analysis\nThe candidate should reach the following conclusions:\n• If the annual fee is dropped, Amex loses $55 * number of cardholders.\nCandidate to calculate: Amex would have to generate new or additional revenues to overcome the loss of annual-fee revenue. Using a conservative estimate, lost revenue will be 10mm * $55 = $550 million.\nInterviewer: Will consumer spending increase sufficiently to generate merchant-transaction revenue?\n• Not likely, since cardholders must still pay-off balances at the end of the month. Therefore, Amex must increase the number of cardholders to increase merchant-transaction revenue.\nInterviewer: Is it possible to increase the number of cardholders enough to offset the lost annual-fee revenue?\n• The average annual transaction revenues are $1,000 * 1% = $10 per member.\n• Therefore, the number of new cardholders required to overcome the revenue loss would be $550M/$10 = 55 million. Is it possible for Amex to gain 55 million new members this year? Not likely.\n• It’s also possible to raise transaction fees: more revenues, but we must address the consequences for vendor relations.\nInterviewer: Should Amex charge interest and allow card-members to hold an unpaid balance? What would the impact be?\n• Prior to making such a change the company should consider the impact of the change on the Amex brand.\nInterviewer: Would the new revenues from interest off-set losses from dropping the annual fee?\n• Depends on the rate of interest and the average balance (estimate 10% and $500). If average balance = $500, at 10% APR = $50 per member * 10 million members = $500 million annually.\n4. Recommendations\nBased on economic analysis, don’t drop the annual fee. It is difficult to replace the lost revenue. While some\noptions exist (i.e., charging interest on balances) the consequences should be explored. Amex could\nissue an interest-driven credit card under a new brand name (in fact, Amex did so with the Optima card).\n5. Additional Considerations\nThe client specifically inquires about the economics of aborting the annual fee. Good answers should focus on this issue, and should provide recommendations based on the analysis.\nGreat answers should explore the issue of rival credit cards entering the market, how their product offering is similar or different from the American Express card, and the strengths and weaknesses of American Express’s position. Alternative revenues should be explored. One option is charging interest and allowing cardholders to hold a balance. Answers should also address how this would affect the AMEX brand, i.e., the consequences of becoming a just another ordinary credit card. Another is enforcing late fees, or raising merchant fees. The consequences of these should be addressed also.\nOutstanding answers should also explore the effects of competition among credit cards and recommend how Amex could increase revenues without dropping the $55 annual fee. For example, comment on the quality of new members acquired, since competition is forcing many credit card companies to issue cards to riskier consumers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new business; market sizing; math problem.\nConsulting Firm: Capital One first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: restaurant & food service; airlines.\nCase Interview Question #00971: Chicago Midway Airport (IATA: MDW) is an international airport on the southwest side of Chicago, Illinois, eight miles (13 km) from Downtown Chicago. Dominated by low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines, Midway airport is the Dallas based carrier’s largest focus city, as of 2013. Midway Airport is the second-largest passenger airport in the Chicago metropolitan area, after O’Hare International Airport.\nOur client is Burger Palace (BP), a regional fast food restaurant chain with 20 locations in the Chicago metropolitan area. Their food offering include burgers, French fries, sodas, and milkshakes. Recently, the owner of Burger Palace has been approached by Midway Airport about opening a new location inside the main terminal. They have asked us to come to a meeting in 20 minutes and tell them if we think this new location would be a profitable venture. What do you think we should tell them?\nAdditional Information:\nIf the candidate asks for more information on the client company or Midway Airport, provide the following data.\na. Facts about Burger Palace – assume these will hold for the new location\n• Average transaction size = $10\n• Variable Costs = 80% of sales (Thus, profit margin = 20%)\n• Fixed Costs = $250,000 royalty fee paid to Midway Airport annually + $200,000 in rent and fixed operating costs\nb. Midway Airport information we know\n• Assume all passengers who come through the airport would have the opportunity to eat at the BP location (there is one main food court for the whole airport)\n• Midway Airport is open every day of the year.\n• Burger Palace will be open the same hours/days that the airport is open\n• Gates at Midway Airport = 25\n• Hours of operation: 4am – 12am (20 hours per day)\n• Average # of planes per hour = 1 per hour per gate\n• Average plane size = 150 passengers, think Southwest (6 across * 25 rows)\n• Average load factor = 66% (number of seats filled on average)\n• People who will eat at Midway Airport = 5% of passengers will eat at Midway\n• Number of employees = 2,000\n• Employees who will eat at the airport each day = 50%\nc. Competition at the airport\n• There are currently 4 restaurants at Midway Airport. They each have an equal market share. If Burger Palace were to open a restaurant we expect that each of the 5 restaurants would gain an equal market share (20%). We would not expect the number of customers to increase because of the new BP location. The share of employee business is also spread out evenly over all restaurants.\nd. What we don’t know\n• Anything about the profitability of the other Burger Palace locations.\n• We don’t know anything about the types of restaurants currently at Midway Airport.\nPossible Answer:\n1. Suggested Framework\nGiven the simple nature of the case, a cost-benefit analysis framework with detail expanding the revenue calculation should help the interviewee work through the problem.\n2. Detailed Analysis\nThis is a simple cost/benefit analysis case with a market sizing component needed for the revenue calculation. There are many different ways to size the market, but this case is designed to go down a specific path based on the case facts that are available. Specifically, the estimate starts with the number of airport gates, then airplanes per gate, people per plane, etc. Some interviewees will have trouble starting the market sizing and may need a little nudge to begin thinking in that manner. That is OK; it isn’t about whether or not someone can read the mind of the interviewer, it’s about how logically they think about the problem as they go. The interviewer should observe:\n• Do they make realistic assumptions about how many people are on a plane?\n• Do they account for the fact that the planes won’t all be full?\n• Do they simplify the math to make it easier for themselves?\nThere are two big insights in the case. First, can the interviewee keep the big picture in mind later in the case? If you concentrate just on the passengers, the math shouldn’t work to make the venture profitable. If you remember that there are other people at the airport (employees), it turns profitable. Also, the airport location would be great advertising for Burger Palace’s other locations in Chicago. How would the interviewee value that advertising?\nCalculations\na. Revenue from Passengers\n25 gates at Midway * 1 plane per hour per gate * 20 hours/day = 500 planes per day\n6 seats across on a plane * 25 rows per plane = 150 passengers capacity\n150 passengers * 66% average load factor = 100 passengers per plane\n500 planes per day * 100 passengers per plane = 50K passengers per day\n50K passengers per day * 5% will eat at the airport * 20% market share = 500 passengers eat at BP per day\n500 passengers * $10 average transaction size * 20% profit margin = $1,000 profit per day\n$1K profit per day * 365 days/year = $365K profit per year\nNote: at this point the profit of $365K < $450K in fixed costs, but who else will be eating at Burger Palace every day? Airport employees!\nb. Revenue from airport employees\n2K Midway employees * 50% of employees eat at the airport each day * 20% market share = 200 employees eat at BP each day\n200 employees * $10 average transaction size * 20% profit margin = $400 profit per day\n$400 profit per day * 365 days/year = $146K profit per year\nc. Yearly Revenue from both sources\n$365K profits from passengers + $146 profits from employees = $511K total revenue\n$511K total revenue – $450K total fixed cost per year = $61K total profit\nBy including the airport staff, the project should generate about $60K in additional profits to Burger Palace per year.\nInterviewer: What else should Burger Palace consider when evaluating this opportunity?\nThis would be a huge advertising opportunity for BP’s other locations in Chicago. If the interviewee comes up with that answer, ask how they would value that advertising. Remember, we believe in market economics at Chicago: think about what it might cost to buy a similar amount of ad space at the airport to get a baseline of what that might be worth to BP.\n3. Recommendations\nInterviewer: Ask the candidate to summarize their findings for the client.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: improve profitability.\nConsulting Firm: PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: manufacturing.\nCase Interview Question #00972: Our client Boozy Co. is an American manufacturing company that produces commodity widgets such as metal door knobs. Their profits have declined over the last three years. Boozy Co. has engaged our consulting firm to help them with this issue. The two questions facing them are:\n1. Determine why profits have declined.\n2. What can Boozy Co. do to restore profitability?\nHow would you go about it?\nAdditional Information:\nHere is some of the information that a candidate may ask for; provide only if the candidate asks.\na. More about the client Boozy Co. \n• They manufacture true commodity products, and have no ability to differentiate.\n• Pricing has held constant for each of their product lines.\n• Overall quantity has remained constant at 100% effective capacity.\nb. The Market\n• No substitutes in the market (make it clear this is not a “five forces” case).\n• Overall market demand has remained constant.\n• COGS and SG&A should be allocated pro rata across total units produced.\n• There are 2 other big competitors in the market.\n• Our competitor’s products are very similar to ours and are priced similarly, too.\n• Our competitors have limited differentiation when it comes to the product, promotions, or price.\nPossible Answer:\n1. Suggested Framework\nThe candidate should, at some point, draw out or at least speak to the profitability framework:\nProfits = Revenue – Cost = (Volume * Price) – (Fixed cost + Variable Cost)\nWhen the candidate discusses revenue/historical company performance – provide Exhibit 1.\nExhibit 1. Boozy Co. Summary Income Statement (in $ million)\n\n\n\nYear\n2012\n2013\n2014\n\n\nNet Sales\n$100\n$90\n$80\n\n\nCost of Goods (COGS)\n$60\n$60\n$60\n\n\nGross Profit\n$40\n$30\n$20\n\n\nSG&A\n$30\n$30\n$30\n\n\nOperating Income (EBIT)\n$10\n0\n($10)\n\n\n\n2. Detailed Analysis\nIf, after seeing Exhibit 1, the candidate asks about the product mix, provide Exhibit 2. If the candidate does not ask about different products under the Boozy portfolio, drive the candidate towards factors that drive revenue – provide Exhibit 2. The candidate must ask about product mix before being given Exhibit 2.\nExhibit 2. Boozy Co. Product Mix\n\n\n\nYear\n2012\n2013\n2014\n\n\nPrice\n\n\n\n\n\nSnoozie\n$5\n$5\n$5\n\n\nCoozie\n$10\n$10\n$10\n\n\nQuantity (millions)\n\n\n\n\n\nSnoozie\n10\n12\n14\n\n\nCoozie\n5\n3\n1\n\n\n\nExplain to the candidate that the Snoozie and Coozie are manufactured interchangeably with the same machines. Let the candidate drive forward on calculations of individual product profitability. This can only be accomplished if, after seeing Exhibit 2, the candidate recognizes that the cost component is still outstanding – provide Exhibit 3.\nExhibit 3. Boozy Co. Unit Costs vs. Competitors: SG&A + materials\n\na. The candidate should recognize that on a fully-loaded basis, we lose money on each Snoozie ($6 total cost, $5 price). Management didn’t realize this because they failed to allocate SG&A.\nb. If demand has remained constant, and price is the only differentiator, Coozie is overpriced and Snoozie is under-priced. Upon reviewing relative cost position slide, the candidate should attack SG&A first and raw materials second and offer thoughtful, specific ideas about how to reduce costs.\nOther insights from Exhibit 3:\nHigher performing candidates will also consider that higher materials/lower labor costs may be related. For example, some locations may have low cost labor, but be far away from raw materials. Or, a highly automated manufacturing process may require less labor, but more materials, etc. It may even be that competitors define each category differently – some costs we put in SG&A may be in Festive’s “labor”. People say some pretty smart things looking at that very simple graph.\nInterviewer: Instruct the candidates to recalculate or speak to changes in the income statement given a product mix change. Higher performing candidates should address the reality that over the long term, commodity prices converge to costs, so Boozy Co. must lower costs to compete.\n3. Recommendations\nInterviewer: The client has asked us for our recommendation. What would you tell the client?\nResponses will include a discussion surrounding the rationale of a shift in strategy to become the low-cost producer in the industry, and/or a broader discussion of enhanced market fragmentation to take advantage of its product mix. Additionally, the candidate must appeal to both the short-run and long-run options. The short term fix (raise price on Snoozie, and lower costs on Coozie to adjust product mix) should be distinctive from any long-term solutions, which can be a bit more creative, surrounding strategy shifts and implementation.\n4. Additional Considerations\nInterviewer: What are some of the potential risks?\nHere are some potential answers:\n• Is our labor cost component lower, and sustainable? Will there be significant capital expenditures due in the near future to maintain/upgrade facilities?\n• Any change in operations may result in modest product deficiencies and/or distribution issue – what is our recourse under this scenario? This may result in a loss of goodwill.\n• Running machines at capacity may result in faster wear and tear, resulting in added maintenance expenditure.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "title": "Novartis New Anti-depressant Drug Approved by FDA",
        "url": "http://www.consultingcase101.com/novartis-new-anti-depressant-drug-approved-by-fda/",
        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new product.\nConsulting Firm: IMS Health Consulting Group first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: healthcare: pharmaceutical, biotech, life sciences.\nCase Interview Question #00973: Our client is the U.S. division of multi-national pharmaceutical corporation Novartis International AG (NYSE: NVS). In about six months Novartis will receive U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to launch a new anti-depressant drug. Despite this apparent good news from the FDA, Novartis USA is not elated. It has concerns over the market potential for this drug and its ability to reach the key prescribers in this therapeutic category. We have been asked to help determine whether they should:\n(1) launch the drug alone,\n(2) co-market with a partner, or\n(3) sell, license or swap the drug.\nThe concerns over market potential center on whether the drug can gain adequate competitive advantage in a market segment having two dominant, patent-protected competitors and nearly 100 generic competitors. Additionally, a higher technology antidepressant, which appears to offer therapeutic advantages, was recently introduced by a major competitor Pfizer.\nGaining the professional endorsement of psychiatrists is crucial to success in this therapeutic category since they write approximately half of the prescriptions for antidepressants. However, Novartis USA has no experience marketing drugs to this physician group. Consequently, it would have to hire a sales force and/or enter into a co-marketing agreement to gain access to psychiatrists through someone else’s force. The client would be able to leverage its existing sales force to reach the other half of the prescribers (Internal Medicine Specialist and Family and General Practitioners).\nHow would you help them decide whether to (1) launch the drug alone, (2) co-market with a partner, or (3) sell, license or swap the drug to a third party?\nPossible Solution:\n1. High Level Plan of Attack\nNote here what is being asked, “How would you help them decide?” What is not being asked is “Which is the correct option to choose?” The Interviewer is looking more for how this problem is approached than for the “correct” answer.\n2. Sample Response\nCandidate: In helping the client decide which option they should choose, I will want to guide them to the option that will create the most value. To understand main value drivers (i.e., profitability drivers), I will first explore the market attractiveness and our competitive position within that market in order to determine revenue potential. After that, I will explore the major cost issues. Starting with the revenue, I’ll want to understand first what the overall market revenue opportunities are for this type of drug in addition to our product specifically.\nInterviewer: Sounds like a good plan.\nCandidate: Now, the client has expressed concern over the market potential for this drug. How big is the market and what is its potential growth rate?\nInterviewer: The overall antidepressant drug market in the U.S. is relatively attractive at $1.1 billion per year and is growing well in excess of the population growth rate.\nCandidate: You mentioned that concerns over market potential center on whether the drug can gain adequate competitive advantage in a market segment having “two dominant, patent-protected competitors and nearly 100 generic competitors.” You also mentioned that a higher technology drug had entered the market. Is the antidepressant market segmented by technology?\nInterviewer: Yes.\nCandidate: And the two patent-protected competitors along with the 100 generic competitors are within our technology segment?\nInterviewer: Correct.\nCandidate: So, the overall antidepressant market is attractive at $1.1 billion, but within that market, there are segments based on different types of technology that may or may not be attractive.\nInterviewer: That’s correct.\nCandidate: What is the technology associated with our client’s product?\nInterviewer: Tricyclic antidepressants.\nCandidate: How fast is this technology segment growing?\nInterviewer: As a matter of fact, substitution by the new technology may cause a decline in sales over the next 5 years. Additionally, the existing competitive environment is very intense and will only increase if the market shrinks.\nCandidate: So, the overall segment is not very attractive.\nInterviewer: Correct.\nCandidate: What percent of the volume do the two main competitors have?\nInterviewer: In our own technology segment, the leader has approximately 10% and the number two player has about 4%. The rest of the 100 competitors each has less than a 2% market share. By comparison, the new technology has captured a 20% market share of the total antidepressant market.\nCandidate: How much will our client’s product be able to differentiate itself within our technology segment?\nInterviewer: Not much. In a market research study we commissioned, the product was seen as very similar to the number two product in our technology segment, slightly inferior to the number one product, and slightly better than the generic products. The new technology was viewed as far better due to a lower level of sedation.\nCandidate: So to summarize the market environment, although the anti-depressant market is attractive, the segment that we would be participating in is relatively unattractive and runs the risk of becoming smaller and more competitive over time. Additionally, within this unattractive segment, we have limited ability to differentiate ourselves relative to our competitors, and thus, will not be able to charge a premium price. I would think that this unattractive market and relatively undifferentiated position within that market would translate to a lower market share. I would estimate that our share might be lower than either of the branded products given our new presence in the market, say maybe a 2-4% share and this, like the rest of the segment, would probably decline over the next couple of years.\nInterviewer: That sounds about right.\nCandidate: Knowing that our revenue potential is relatively low puts more pressure on minimizing the costs if we were to market the drug. I want to see what area within the cost structure impacts profitability the most. What percent of net sales is COGS?\nInterviewer: About 20%\nCandidate: And what is the bulk of the remaining line items?\nInterviewer: Most of it is selling expense. There are some overhead/admin and advertising and promotional expenses, but most of it is selling expenses.\nCandidate: So, selling expense is the largest portion of the cost structure, which means that whichever option we choose, launching alone vs. with a partner will certainly impact the selling expense (in addition to the number of prescribers reached, thus revenue potential). In understanding the effect of the co-market agreement on number of prescribers reached, I think it would be helpful if I could get an idea of who makes the purchasing decision.\nInterviewer: Well, there are four main parties involved. There are the manufacturers (such as our client), the doctors (who prescribe the drug), the druggists (who fill the prescription) and the patient (who initiates the transaction). Selling is concentrated on the doctors, since they are the group that determines if medication is needed and, if so, what type.\nCandidate: Is the growth in managed care going to influence the dynamics of this?\nInterviewer: Yes, but for the purposes of our work, let’s not address that.\nCandidate: So, for the purposes of our work, the doctors make the purchasing decisions, this includes two groups of physicians, the Psychiatric group and the Internal Medicine/General Practitioner group.\nInterviewer: Correct.\nCandidate: You noted that we don’t currently have connections to psychiatrists. This group prescribes half of the antidepressants. Can we launch the drug by only marketing to Internal Medicine Specialist and general practitioners and ignoring psychiatrists?\nInterviewer: No, they are at the top of the pyramid of influence and thus must endorse the drug before their colleagues in the IMP/GP will endorse it.\nCandidate: So if we are to market this product, we cannot do so without the Psychiatric group. The weight of the decision then becomes a matter of what is the most efficient and effective way to reach them — either through a newly hired sales force or with a co-marketing agreement.\nInterviewer: Correct.\nCandidate: What are the advantages and disadvantages of marketing the drug ourselves?\nInterviewer: In terms of having our own sales force, the main benefit would be that we would be concentrating on our product only and this may help sales. On the downside however, the cost of this focus is all attributed completely to our product, and having a dedicated sales force representing only one product would be expensive.\nCandidate: Do you have any other psychotheraputic drugs in development or plans to expand this part of your portfolio through licensing?\nInterviewer: Nothing is planned for the next three years.\nCandidate: So by entering a co-marketing agreement, the costs of the sales force is spread across several products, and, if the co-marketer did not have a competing product, then our product would get the appropriate selling attention warranted. Also, since this sales force has existing relationships with the psychiatrists and doesn’t need to take time to further establish these relationships, sales of our product might peak sooner. So, all in all, I would think that if we were to market this product, it would be a less costly and higher value option to enter into a co-marketing agreement rather than go it alone.\nInterviewer: OK, and what about the third option, to sell, license or swap the drug to a third party?\nCandidate: Again, the client would want to choose the option that was more value creating. There could be several reasons for going with the third option: We might sell our drug because the sum of the promotional or overhead costs may make it unprofitable for us to market whereas a company having a similar product line might be able to carry this product at a very small incremental cost. We might license it for the same reasons we would sell it. We might swap it if we could find a company needing this type of drug while having a drug that might fit more with our existing infrastructure. In any case, for the options being considered, I would want to forecast cash flows and discount them back to see what option is more value creating before making a final recommendation.\nInterviewer: OK, thank you for your input on how to approach this problem.\n3. General Summary Comments\nThe Candidate doesn’t actually make a final recommendation in this case. This is fine. The Candidate has demonstrated how he would approach the problem, and in doing so, has hit on many of the key issues you would find in a real client case situation.\nRecapping the steps the Candidate took into evaluating the client’s options:\na. On the revenue side\n• Segmented the market to the appropriate technology level.\n• Determined that the segment was unattractive.\n• Determined that the client’s product was not significantly differentiated.\n• Concluded that for these reasons, the revenue potential was limited.\nb. On the cost side\n• Determined that selling expense was a key component to profitability.\n• Determined that the Psychiatric group needed to be included in the selling efforts.\n• Determined that it would be less expensive to co-market vs. go it alone.\n• Determined that there are other considerations to evaluate when comparing co-marketing vs. selling, licensing, or swapping the product.\nAnother important point to note is that as with most case interviews, the Candidate has the opportunity to go “deep” into an issue. The Candidate chose to do so with one type of cost, the sales force. The Interviewer is looking to see if the Candidate can identify some of the key “value” drivers of the function being explored. In the case of the sales force, the Candidate correctly identified the key value drivers as being:\n• The ability to spread the cost of a sales call across multiple products.\n• The ability to choose a co-marketer that needs this product in their existing product line.\n• The ability to leverage an existing psychiatric sales force infrastructure to reach peak sales sooner.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: private equity & investment.\nConsulting Firm: Capgemini first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: small business, startups; entertainment.\nCase Interview Question #00960: Your client Union Square Ventures (USV) is a New York-based venture capital firm that manages assets totaling $650 million as of January 2014. Originally founded in 2003, the VC firm is best known for its early investments in technology companies including Zynga, Twitter, Foursquare and Tumblr.\nUnion Square Ventures is interested in investing in a profitable technology startup company – videos.com. The startup company provides home delivery of rental DVD/VCDs which are ordered online on their website videos.com. The startup currently would serve only the Manhattan area in New York City. Should our client Union Square Ventures invest in the startup company? What do we need to know?\nPossible Answer:\nInterviewer: First, let’s estimate the size of the market in two years.\nCandidate:\nAssume the population of Manhattan is 2 million and 75% of the population has Internet access.\nAssume that 10% of NYC households currently rent videos online and that this is expected to grow at 10% per year.\n2M people * 75% = 1.5M people with internet access\n1.5M people = 500K households\n500K households * 10% = 50K rent videos online\nHouseholds renting videos online:\nToday = 50K\nYear 1 = 50K * (1+10%) = 55K\nYear 2 = 55K * (1+10%) = 60.5K (this is what the candidate should get to)\nInterviewer: Right now, we know that people who rent movies online rent 1 movie per month on average. But we know that this number will decrease to 8 movies a year in two years. what is the change in our market?\nThe candidate should calculate the following:\nTotal rentals:\nToday = 50K * 12 = 600K videos a year\nYear 2 = 60K * 8 = 480K videos a year\n480K/600K = 80%\nThis is a 20% decrease in market size.\nInterviewer: What does this mean for our target company videos.com? What can our client do to mitigate this issue?\nPotential Answers could be to sell complimentary goods along with videos, for example, video games, gift certificates, popcorn, etc.\nInterviewer: Suppose Blockbuster charges $3.50 per movie. Our focus is to make a profit of $30 per hour. Since our target company videos.com is going to hand deliver movies, our delivery cost is $22 per hour with 5 deliveries per hour and an average of 3 movies are included per delivery. The prepaid envelope to return the movies is 50 cents each. Can we match Blockbuster’s price?\nCandidate:\nOur delivery cost = $22 / (3*5) = $1.50 per movie\nPrepaid envelope = $0.50/movie\nOur required profit = $30 / (3*5) = $2.00/movie\nOur price = $1.50 + $0.50 + $2.00 = $4.00 per movie\nNo, we will not be able to match Blockbuster’s price.\nRecommendations\nInterviewer: What are your recommendations to our client?\nAdditional Considerations\nInterviewer: If time allows, ask the candidate to list other risks and considerations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Consulting first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: food & beverages; mass media & communications; tobacco & alcohol.\nCase Interview Question #00959: The client DB Breweries is one of New Zealand’s largest beer manufacturers. The company mainly produces pale lager, whilst its TUI brand is one of the better known beers in New Zealand. DB Breweries owns and operates four breweries in New Zealand – Waitemata Brewery (Otahuhu, Auckland), Tui Brewery (Mangatainoka), DB Draught Brewery (Timaru) and Monteith’s Brewery (Greymouth).\nRecently, the client DB Breweries has been contacted by Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), a leading Australian broadcast company for a sale of an exclusive broadcasting right of a pre-determined TV program in New Zealand. The client has come to us and wonders how that is related to their business. How would you go about it? What would you recommend the client do?\nAdditional Information:\nIf the candidate asks for more information, provide the following data.\nThe exclusive broadcasting right is for $10 Million. The TV program is pre-determined and our client cannot change it. If our client wants to advertise on the TV program, they would have to pay as everyone would. The pre-determined TV program is a popular sport in New Zealand. Currently, there is no program like that in New Zealand.\nThe New Zealand beer industry is dominated by our client who has 50% of the market and its closest competitor has the remaining 50% of the market. It’s a mature industry, growing at GDP growth rate.\nBars in New Zealand can only source beer from one brewer, namely either our client or its competitor. A bar cannot buy beer from both.\nIf asked, the interviewer would tell you the profit margin of beer in New Zealand. I can’t remember the exact number, it’s something like 50 cents per beer.\nPossible Answer:\n1. Suggested Framework\nFigure out why the TV program is relevant to the beer company. We can use the investment framework. Calculate the sources of income and NPVs.\n• Market/Customer:\n– How will the market react?\n• Valuation:\n– Sources of revenue\n– Costs\n– NPV/cash flows\n• Strategic Fit:\n– How does this fit with the company’s core business?\n– What alternatives exist for investment?\n• Competition:\n– Competitor’s possible reaction\n2. Detailed Analysis\nLet the candidate make estimates for the different sources of revenue and guide him/her on how to validate these estimates.\nIt turns out that the beer manufacturer DB Breweries can purchase the TV program and play them only in bars which carry its beer. This way, they will attract more people to the bar and keep people in the bar for longer. At this point, I was asked to do a market sizing, to estimate how much incremental revenue would come in from this source.\nThen you have to realize that this is not the only source of revenue. Another channel is beer consumption at parties or at home. Because of the popularity of the client’s bars and TV program, people would like to buy more of its beer to drink at home as well. I was asked to estimate this source of revenue as well.\nLastly, you have to calculate the NPV (net present value) to see if it makes sense to invest.\nI was also asked in the middle about how to verify my estimate on increases of beer sale in the bar. It’s a creative question, you can come up with as many ideas as you can think of. For example:\n• Test market: measure the increase in the test bars.\n• Interview waiters in the bar and see what they think.\nThen it’s the conclusion. Make sure you talk about both the pros and cons about the deal. This is typical of expansion strategies. Think about the benefits and how well this new deal aligns with the company’s core business. Does this help with entering the Australian market?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

They produce cement like materials that are used in constructions. Ponce has recently researched a new product which is a special cement to be used in construction for single story low income houses. It cannot be used for multiple story houses and it has a coarse finish, so it cannot be used in high quality houses. However, there is a strong market for single story low income houses in Mexico and Ponce says that the product will sell like hot cakes. We trust Ponce’s judgment on this.\nThe client Ponce Cement has been approached by CEMEX, the number one building materials company in Mexico, about this new product and Ponce has to respond to CEMEX within a week. The options that CEMEX has given Ponce are:\nA. Ponce and CEMEX will be partners. CEMEX will help Ponce in selling and distributing the new material.\nB. Ponce will sign CEMEX as the exclusive supplier of this new material.\nC. CEMEX will buy over the rights to the formula for the new material and will contract Ponce to further improve the formula.\nOur consulting team is to help the CEO of Ponce Cement decide which of the three options to take. What would you recommend?\nPossible Answer:\nAmong the first questions that a good candidate will ask is: Why look at CEMEX at all? Can’t Ponce not worry about CEMEX’s offer and just do everything by itself? The answer is that CEMEX has great capabilities in sales and distribution. They are the 2nd largest supplier of such products in Southern US and the largest in Mexico. They have a reach that is much farther than that of Ponce and Ponce will benefit from the alliance.\nThe following table lists the merits and demerits of the three approaches. Candidates can be given the information in the table, but ONLY if the candidate asks for it. The information should not be supplied as a table. Instead, supply bits and pieces as and when the candidate asks for it. For example, if the candidate asks, “What’s the price that CEMEX will pay for option A?”, reply: “We do not know the exact price, but we know it’s lower than what they will get for option B”.\n\n\n\nOption\nMerits\nDemerits\n\n\nOption A\n\n\nPonce can sell through other channels/distributors as well.\nPonce can reach the markets that it would not be able to without CEMEX.\n\n\n\n\nCEMEX will pay a lower price for this than that for option B.\n\n\n\n\nOption B\n\n\nCEMEX will pay a higher price than that for option A.\nPonce can reach the markets that it would not be able to without CEMEX.\n\n\n\n\nPonce will not be able to sell through any other distributor.\n\n\n\n\nOption C\n\n\nThere will be a one-time payment that is mutually agreed upon. It is believed that CEMEX is willing to pay a really high price for the formula because of its “will sell like hot-cakes” nature.\nPonce can continue to work on the formula. Ponce will get the recognition for being the inventors of the formula.\nPonce does not have the capability to manufacture enough of the new material to supply the southern US and Mexico. It’s a small company, specializing in R&D and can only supply to North West Mexico.\n\n\n\n\nPonce will lose rights to the formula.\nNPV analysis may be difficult to do because of the immense future of this formula.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe key bit of information above is that last bullet in Option C merits. It shows that Ponce will not be able to supply to a large market and so, the best option for it is to sell the rights to the formula to CEMEX and to focus on its core competency, R&D.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The company is one of the world’s largest suppliers of eye health products, including contact lenses, lens care products, medicines and implants for eye diseases. Bausch & Lomb is headquartered in Bridgewater, New Jersey, United States, and employs more than 13,000 people as of 2015.\nBausch & Lomb manufactures and distributes contact lenses in the U.S. Bausch & Lomb is one of the largest players in the US market, and has been for quite some time. However, the company feels that compared to its main competitor, it is not doing as well as it could. The CEO of Bausch & Lomb has called in McKinsey & Company to find out how to solve this problem and to recommend a solution. How would you go about it?\nAdditional Information: \nIf the candidate asks for more information on the company/product, provide the following data.\n• For the scope of this case, Bausch & Lomb manufactures and distributes only in the U.S.\n• Demand for contact lenses has been growing steadily at about 3% annually.\nThe problem of the case as stated is intentionally very vague. Interviewee should clarify what is meant by “compared to its main competitor, not doing as well as it could”, not just assume that it means lack of growth, etc.\n• Bausch & Lomb completed a benchmark study of itself versus its biggest competitor and discovered that its profits are not growing as fast as the competitors’.\n• There are only two main players in market: Bausch & Lomb and Competitor Johnson & Johnson. Other, smaller firms exist, but for the scope of this case are negligible.\n• Competitor Johnson & Johnson is also a US-only manufacturer & distributor of contact lenses.\n• Market is equally divided between Bausch & Lomb and Competitor Johnson & Johnson.\n• Bausch & Lomb and Competitor Johnson & Johnson are of roughly equal size.\n• Bausch & Lomb and Competitor Johnson & Johnson sell the same products.\nPossible Answer:\n1. Suggested Framework\nQuestion: How would you go about structuring an analysis of this problem?\nNote: If the interviewee hasn’t clarified the purpose of the case (i.e. what problem does Bausch & Lomb want them to solve?), push them to do so. A lot of people automatically assume that Bausch & Lomb’s sales aren’t growing at industry rate, or that Bausch & Lomb isn’t satisfied with its market share. If they do, I usually read back the statement of the issue in the introduction (“compared to its main competitor, it is not doing as well as it could”) and ask them to explain to me what that could mean. If they still don’t get it, I point out that the statement is very subjective (as in, could be interpreted to mean many different things) and by then, they usually figure it out.\nThis is a profitability problem, so classic profitability framework will work: profits = revenues – costs = (price * volume) – (fixed costs + variable costs).\nThe best candidates will be specific about their bullet points, giving concrete examples and eliminating certain areas based on their communicated hypotheses.\nMost candidates don’t do this, so after the framework is laid out, I usually push back and ask them.\n2. Detailed Analysis\nQuestion: Based on the information I’ve given you so far, and based on what you know about the contact lens industry, where do you think the problem lies?\nWhat answer they end up with doesn’t matter, but they should concretely and rationally eliminate certain options.\nThe easiest way to reason out possible problem area is by thinking about current, established major contact lens players – Bausch & Lomb, and Johnson & Johnson.\nThis is an example of how to analyze the situation:\nContact lens industry is defined by high barriers to entry (since high R&D outlay necessary); also, industry is mature (20 years plus) & dominated by two players, so can expect the two main players to be equal in most things. Thus\n(1) Cost side\n• Variable costs\n– Raw Material: inputs will be plastic, saline solution (water, salt), packaging (paper, aluminum foil, plastic). These are all commodities. Any issues Bausch & Lomb has with raw material costs are likely also experienced by the Competitor Johnson & Johnson. Thus not an issue.\n– Labor: will be unskilled, wage rate probably set by minimum wage standards. Unless unionized and competitor not, nothing here to put Bausch & Lomb at disadvantage to Competitor Johnson & Johnson. Thus not an issue.\n• Fixed costs\n– Plant, Property & Equipment: given U.S. contact lens industry, probably no difference between Bausch & Lomb and Competitor Johnson & Johnson. There should be no major difference in plant costs or plant efficiency. Probably no major equipment differences.\n– R&D: big cost factor, but probably equal between Bausch & Lomb and Competitor Johnson & Johnson.\n– Overhead (People): Again, no major differences as both companies are of similar size.\n– Marketing/Distribution: Probably no differences.\n– Legal issues? Possible, but Bausch & Lomb is probably big enough that even a huge class action settlement shouldn’t affect its bottom line too much.\n(2) Sales side\n• Pricing\n– Contact lenses are fairly commoditized. Minor differences in pricing may exist, but probably nothing major.\n– Customers may be price sensitive, but given that contact lenses are fitted to a person by their doctor, customers do not purchase lens purely on price. Comfort/fit and compatibility is a big issue.\n• Product mix: Maybe Competitor is selling more profitable mix of lenses?\n• Distribution/Sales channels: Competitor may be selling through more profitable channels?\n• Volume\n– Substitute goods: May be substituting away from Bausch & Lomb? However, any substitutes (Lasik, glasses, etc.) will likely hit Competitor equally.\n– Competitor may capture more of market – better branding, better distribution, better price, better products? Could be possible.\nQuestion: After analyzing Bausch & Lomb’s cost structure, McKinsey is confident that Bausch & Lomb’s costs are extremely competitive. Knowing this, where do you think the problem could lie?\nCandidate: Sales side.\nQuestion: McKinsey analyzed the distribution channels of Bausch & Lomb and its competitor Johnson & Johnson, and came up with the following information. (show Customer Mix slide)\nSlide 1. Customer Mix of Bausch & Lomb and Competitor Johnson & Johnson\n\nSlide is vague. Interviewee should immediately walk through and clarify what is being shown. Most candidates won’t do this. If they don’t, start pointing things out to them.\n– Slide shows customer mix in terms of sales volume. Competitor Johnson & Johnson and Bausch & Lomb sell equal volume annually (10,000,000 lenses per year or whatever).\n–> So big takeaway is that Competitor Johnson & Johnson sells more via Doctor’s offices; Bausch & Lomb via Optical Retailers.\n• Big Box Discounter = Walmart, Target, Sam’s Club, Costco\n• Doctor’s Offices = your local mom & pop non-chain doctor’s office\n• Optical Retailer = Lenscrafters, etc.\n–> So obviously, varying degrees of buying power. Big Box Discounter like Walmart purchases in large volume; Doctor’s office is purchasing in small quantities, probably also not super business savvy (no procurement department). Lenscrafter is in the middle.\nIn addition, different differentiation: Big Box Discounter like Walmart is known for cheap prices; Doctor’s office is specialized & high on service. Lenscrafter is in the middle.\n• Bausch & Lomb and Competitor Johnson & Johnson charge same prices for same products (as established earlier in framework).\n–> At this point, a great candidate will remember the problem at hand (less profitable than competitor), combine it with the new information and realize that there must be a pricing difference between the different sales channels.\nOnce difference in pricing is established, ask:\nQuestion: Does this Surprise You?\nThe candidate should make some sort of intelligent comment about how, given the types of retailers, no, it does not surprise him/her.\n(Now show the candidate profitability by customer Slide)\nSlide 2. Profitability by Customer\n\n\n\nPer box of contacts (6 lenses)\nBig Box Discounter\nDoctor’s Office\nOptical Retailer\n\n\nRevenue\n$16.50\n$28.00\n$22.00\n\n\nCOGS\n$8.00\n$8.00\n$8.00\n\n\nSales, Distribution\n$5.00\n$2.00\n$3.50\n\n\nOther Fixed Costs\n$2.00\n$2.00\n$2.00\n\n\nProfit (ask candidate to calculate)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: Can you tell me what you see here, does any of this surprise you? (show profitability by customer slide)\nThe candidate should point out that prices are in line with what was expected. Walmart is lowest, Doctor’s offices highest. Given purchasing power, it makes sense. Also, customers generally are willing to pay a premium at a Doctor’s office, since service is more individual.\nCOGS: it makes sense that COGS are equal in all channels, as the same product is sold in each channel.\nSales, Distribution: it’s interesting that Sales & Distribution Costs are different. It could be because Walmart requires more advertising, cash for shelf space?\nFixed Costs: it makes sense that Fixed Costs are equal. Again, same product.\nQuestion: Ask the candidate to calculate profit and percent profit margin. It’s OK to estimate on margin.\n• Big Box Discounter: $16.5-$8-$5-$2 = $1.5, $1.5/$16.5 = 9%\n• Doctor’s Office: $28-$8-$2-$2 = $16, $16/$28 = 57%\n• Optical Retailer: $22-$8-$3.5-$2 = $8.5, $8.5/$22 = 39%\nQuestion: Does any of this surprise you?\nCandidate: Make appropriate comment.\nQuestion: Given this information and given the initial problem you’re solving for, what would you want to look at now?\nCandidate: How can we sell more lenses via the Doctor’s Office channel?\nExcellent candidates might also comment that they’re curious as to why Bausch & Lomb is even bothering to sell in the Big Box Channel – why not pull out and focus resources/attention on improving sales in Doctor’s Offices, instead?\nQuestion: Like its competitor Johnson & Johnson, Bausch & Lomb relies on sales reps to distribute its contact lenses to the Doctor’s Offices. Currently, Bausch & Lomb has 5 reps in its call center dedicated to reaching out to the Doctor’s Offices and doing whatever is necessary to get them to sell as many Bausch & Lomb lenses as possible.\nInterestingly, McKinsey has discovered a relationship between call frequency and sales generated:\n• For every 2 calls made to a customer per month, our client sees a 5% increase in revenue from that customer.\n• For every 3 calls made, our client sees a 15% increase in revenue over revenue for 1 call.\nCurrently, each B&L sales person has 100 customer accounts. Each account must be called at least once a month, as B&L does not want to lose any customers. Assume that sales per customers, when the customer is called once a month, is $100.\nGiven these findings, what should Bausch & Lomb do?\nCandidate:\nTo maximize profits, the candidate must consider how to best distribute phone calls.\nAdditional Information to be given if asked:\n• Each sales call takes 30 minutes.\n• Each sales rep works 20 days per month, 8 hours a day.\n• Each sales rep spends approximately 3 hours of each work day on administrative work, lunch break, etc.\nCalculation:\n8 hours a day less 3 hours a day for admin = 5 hours a day for sales calls.\n5 hours divided by 30 min per call = 10 calls per day.\n10 calls per day times 20 work days per month = Max. capacity is 200 calls per month per rep.\n200 calls max less 100 calls necessary = 100 “free” calls.\nThe sales reps have already called all customers once.\n– To reach 3 calls per month, they must call customer 2 more times. 100/2 = 50 customers, they are able to call 3 times per month for 50 customers.\n– To reach 2 calls per month, they must call customer 1 more time. 100/1 = 100 customers, they are able to call 2 times per month for 100 customers.\n• 1 call: sales per customer = $100\n• 2 calls: sales per customer = $100 * 1.05 = $105\n• 3 calls: sales per customer = $100 * 1.15 = $115\nIf all customers are called twice, then sales = 100 customers * $105 per customer = $10,500\nOtherwise, 50 customers are called once and 50 customers are called 3 times, sales = 50 customers * $100 + 50 customers * $115 = $10,750\n3. Recommendations\nThe client company Bausch & Lomb should call 50 customers once and 50 customers 3 times.\n4. Additional Considerations\nSee Above\n5. Primary Takeaways from Case\n• Make sure you understand what problem you’re trying to solve. If the problem is vague, clarify it before you start your framework, otherwise, how do you know what you’re solving for?\n• Don’t jump to conclusions on slides. Even if you think you understand everything on it, verify with the interviewer to make sure your understanding is correct.\n• Take every sub-conclusion back to the main question.\n• Sanity check everything you conclude and/or see. Does this make sense? Is this what I expected to see?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Consulting first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: tourism, hospitality, lodging.\nCase Interview Question #00962: Your client Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, Inc. is an American hotel and leisure company headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, United States. One of the world’s largest hotel companies, Starwood owns, operates, franchises and manages hotels, resorts, spas, residences, and vacation ownership properties under its 11 owned brands. As of December 2014, Starwood Hotels and Resorts owned, managed, or franchised over 1,200 properties employing over 180,400 people.\nRecently, Starwood has the opportunity to invest in building a 400 room hotel on an Army base. The investment opportunity was given to the client by the U.S. Army. The government has decided to give your client the land for free – Your client can build the hotel and keep all of the profits. Your client Starwood has hired your consulting firm to find out what they need to know to determine if they should take the opportunity build the new hotel or not. What would you recommend?\nAdditional Information:\nIf the candidate asks for more information on the product, provide the following data.\n1. Existing hotels near the army base.\nThere are three hotels near the army base. Each is approximately 20 miles away:\n• Hilton – $110/night\n• Hampton Inn – $75/night\n• Days Inn – $40/night\n2. Purpose of the new hotel\nThe proposed new hotel is for the use of soldiers at the army base for training as well as temporary housing for those who have been relocated to the base. There are two training classes held at the base:\n• Basic Officer Training: 200 soldiers per class. Class lasts 10 weeks. Class held 5 times per year.\n• Advanced Officer Training: 50 soldiers per class. Class lasts 4 weeks. Class held 10 times per year.\n3. With respect to temporary housing: soldiers are transferred every 3 years and are given 15 days to find a permanent place to stay. There are 9,000 active duty soldiers subject the this rotation.\nPossible Answer:\n1. Suggested Framework\nProfitability framework can be used to solve this “investment” case: profits = revenues – costs\n2. Detailed Analysis\nInterviewer: The Army will reimburse soldiers $75 per night (per diem). How much would you charge at the hotel?\n• If asked, clarify that the per diem reimbursement is also intended to cover the soldiers dinner and breakfast.\n• Probe the candidate to determine how much per night the hotel will charge and what services should be included.\nAssume for purposes of the rest of the case that the client decides the hotel will charge a rate of $60/night.\nInterviewer: Assuming that the classes and relocation of soldiers are the only sources of revenue, what is the total potential revenue per year for the new hotel?\n\n\nType of Training\nNumber of People\nTime Period\nTimes a year\nTotal # rooms per year\n\n\nBasic\n200\n10 weeks\n5\n200*10*7*5 = 70,000\n\n\nAdvanced\n50\n4 weeks\n10\n50*4*7*10 = 14,000\n\n\nTemporary\n3,000\n15 nights\n\n3,000*15 = 45,000\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n\n129,000, round to 130,000\n\n\nAt $60/night, total potential revenue = 130,000 * $60 = $7.8 million\nInterviewer: Having addressed the revenue side lets talk about costs. What are the costs associated with operating a hotel?\nAfter the candidate lists relevant fixed and variable operating costs such as labor, supplies and utilities, tell them to assume that total operating costs are $4 million per year.\nInterviewer: What are the other costs associate with running a hotel?\nHere we are looking for the candidate to talk about investment costs. We determined that the Hampton Inn made an initial investment of $50,000 per room. We will assume the same costs for our new hotel. The candidate should calculate a total initial investment of $50K * 400 = $20 million to build a 400 room hotel.\nInterviewer: Are there any issues that may keep the hotel from attaining the calculated revenue?\nWe are looking for the candidate to touch on capacity issues. After the candidate mentions capacity state that during their busiest part of the year, which lasts four months, the hotel runs a capacity shortage of 80 rooms.\nInterviewer: Ask the candidate to recalculate the revenue projection created earlier.\nCalculation:\nThey will be short of 80 rooms * 4 months * 30 days per month = 9,600 rooms per year (tell the candidate to round this to 10,000 rooms). So, the new number of rooms are 130,000 – 10,000 = 120,000.\nrevenue = 120K * $60 per night = $7.2M / year\n$7.2M – $4M (Operating Cost) = $3.2M per year (profit)\nInterviewer: What is the breakeven period for the client Starwood?\n$20M (initial investment) / $3.2M (annual profit) = 6-7 years.\nInterviewer: Is this a good rate of return? Why do you think so?\nInterviewer: Let’s assume the client Starwood wants to break even by 4-5 years. What else can you do to bring down the break even time?\nProbe the candidate to come up with ideas. Some suggestions:\n• Add a restaurant to the hotel\n• Find ways to decrease costs\n• Decrease the number of hotel rooms and keep utilization up\n3. Recommendations\nAsk the candidate to summarize the findings of the case.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: merger & acquisition (M&A).\nConsulting Firm: Boston Consulting Group (BCG) first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: apparel, clothing, textiles.\nCase Interview Question #00949: Our client Johnston & Murphy is a major global shoe manufacturer based in Nashville, Tennessee, United States. The company specializes in handcrafted leather boots and dress shoes for men and women. The Johnston & Murphy branded shoes are sold to customers in the United States and 92 foreign countries.\nCurrently Johnston & Murphy is the #2 shoe manufacturer in the U.S. (based on revenue) and are seeking to dethrone the #1 shoe manufacturer. They have tried several strategies in the past and none have worked. They are now looking to purchase the #3 shoe manufacturer to see if combined, they can overcome #1. The #3 manufacturer has quoted a price of $480 million preliminarily for the sale. Should they go forward with the acquisition? Why or why not?\nPossible Answer:\n1. Suggested Structure\nA good structure should include acquisition target attractiveness, economics of deal / financials, fit with acquirer (with factors like synergies, cannibalization risk, etc), alternatives to acquisition.\n2. Gathering Information\nThe candidate should start methodically gathering data about the specific situation with questions about the three players, their target customer segments. When asked by the candidate, the interviewer can release the following data.\nAdditional Information:\n• Both #2 and #3 shoe manufacturers make similar shoes (primarily dress shoes).\n• Both #2 and #3 shoe manufacturers sell in roughly the same places.\n• The #3 manufacturer’s shoes are perceived as being of lower category.\n• Despite being one company, the two brands could remain separate after the acquisition, however they would not want to market against each other in advertising as they have been in the past.\n• There is a risk of market cannibalization, leading to total sales being lower.\n• If the brands were to be seen as being produced together, they could affect consumer perceptions, also affecting sales.\n• There is a possibility for synergies leading to more efficient operations and improved profit margins for both companies.\nThe key part of the case is economics and valuation and the candidate should get there quickly.\n3. Valuing the Target Company\nInterviewer: What would you take into account when going through a valuation of this deal?\nCandidate: We could look at Multiples/Comparables analysis, NPV (net present value) of cash flows, Book Value. Note to Interviewer: When NPV comes up, say that you’re not interested in the time value of money effects.\nInterviewer: (Interviewer prefers valuing the target company with an aggregate cash flow analysis, like NPV assuming that the value of the money will stay the same, and no cost of capital needs to be taken into account)\n• The payback period would be 8 years\n• The current revenue for the #2 shoe manufacturer are $1B, with a 10% profit margin ($100M profit per year)\n• The current revenue for the #3 shoe manufacturer are $750M with a 8% profit margin ($60M profit per year)\nAfter the candidate conducts an initial analysis of the profits from the #3 manufacturer aggregated over 8 years ($60M profit per year, times 8 years = $480M), suggest what were to happen if:\n• The synergies from the deal increased the total profit for the #2 manufacturer (our client) by 15% (would now make the total profit $115M per year), and increased the total profit of the #3 manufacturer by $10M, how would that affect things (#3 would now have $70M profit per year)?\nCandidate: We must add the $70M to the additional $15M from the synergy, leading to $85M in profit per year, and then again multiply by 8, leading to $680M.\nIn conclusion, if the candidate acknowledges that these are assumptions on synergies that are reasonable, this seems like a great opportunity.\n4. Synergies\nInterviewer: What kind of synergies could we have here? (brainstorming)\nCandidate: Revenue and cost, with more opportunities in cost.\nOn the revenue side, there are volume pricing synergies and negotiation tactics with large retailers as a large shoe manufacturer.\nOn the cost side the value chain is: Material –> Labor / manufacturing –> Distribution –> Retailer / Customer. On Materials, theres an opportunity to negotiate and consolidate. On manufacturing we could consolidate plants potentially.\nInterviewer: If our client has 3 US plants and the target company also has 3, how would you determine how many to shut down?\nCandidate: I’d evaluate the existing capacity in plants, the economics/profitability of each plant, the strategic rationale for their existence (e.g. distance to inputs, outputs), and the cultural and political underpinnings of each plant relative to the combined company. Also, the marginal cost to produce products from each plant is a key consideration and the lower the better. We could also look at outsourcing to lower costs.\nInterviewer: Once you are reasonably satisfied with the synergies, move towards risks.\n5. Addressing the Risks\nInterviewer: Push the candidate to identify some potential risks of the acquisition.\nCandidate: Cannibalization, brand dilution due to lower quality of #3 manufacturer.\nInterviewer: It’s possible that the risks you identified of cannibalization and brand confusion may indeed come to pass. To make sure that this isn’t something we should worry about, what should be done?\nCandidate:\n• Identify customer demographics through sales tracking.\n• Get a representative focus group together to see how they would react to brand differences, or if they would care if the two brands were owned by similar companies.\n• Send a survey to a larger group of customers, or the general population to assess the effects.\n• Other reasonable answers are equally valid.\nOverall, listening to the voice of the customer could give insight into how they would react to the deal and any semblance that the two shoe manufacturers are working together.\n6. Recommendation\nThe candidate should remark that the client company should go ahead with the acquisition at the price #3 manufacturer has quoted, as the potential profit given the synergy assumptions leads to a great profit. The candidate should state that they need to make sure that the synergy assumptions are sound, and that market research should be done to make sure that customers will not have adverse reactions to the merger or that their brand awareness will be impacted so as to potentially damage sales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: marketing strategy.\nConsulting Firm: Capital One first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: Household Goods, Consumer Products.\nCase Interview Question #00951: One of our long-term clients The Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE: CL) is a major toothpaste company. Other than toothpaste, the company is also engaged in the the production, distribution and provision of household, health care and personal products, such as soaps, detergents, and oral hygiene products (including toothbrushes). The company’s corporate headquarters are on Park Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, New York City.\nColgate’s president just called us because they’ve been given an opportunity to sponsor a NASCAR (National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing) team, and their chairman is very excited about it. The cost to sponsor the NASCAR team is $20M. However, the president is not so sure that this is a good idea. He’s called us to ask what are some of the things he should be considering before making a decision.\nPossible Answer:\n1. Gathering Information and Structuring the Problem\nThis is a marketing case. The candidate should take a moment to come up with a proper structure. Key elements are fit with current marketing strategy and profitability. Others such as amount of exposure/impressions work as well, but the first two should be touched upon.\nCandidate should be sure to ask probing questions about the current marketing strategy:\n• Customer: Candidate should explore target consumer and come to the realization that NASCAR audiences do not have a high overlap with people who make household purchasing decisions about toothpaste.\n• Channels: Candidate should also explore current marketing channels, e.g., TV, radio, print, other sports opportunities, etc. Where does this fit in?\n• Budget: How significant is $20M relative to the client’s total marketing budget? If not done so already, the interviewer should reveal that the client company has $500M revenue, and COGS is 50% of revenue. Let the candidate identify and estimate other components of the $500M such as overhead, selling expenses, etc., but should drive to discover that $100M (or 20%) of revenue is spent on advertising. Key Insight: $20M is a significant portion of annual marketing budget.\n• Exposures – talk about how you would estimate the cost per impression (like a market sizing, but just high level approach). TV and live audience size, number of events, # of top 3 finishes, etc. Compare this cost per impression with other marketing channels.\n2. Option Evaluation & Conclusion\nInterviewer: We see that it is significant from a marketing budget standpoint. How would you determine whether a campaign such as this is effective?\nThe candidate should realize that this is the core of the case. The candidate should discuss how we could determine whether the NASCAR sponsorship will increase sales. Some ideas include looking at incremental sales, conducting market research, consumer research, benchmarking, etc.\nInterviewer: It turns out that our client has a good relationship with the folks at Gillette. who also sponsor a NASCAR team for $20M. They’ve told us that they have seen incremental sales of $100M as a result of their NASCAR sponsorship. Do you think we could hit the same number? Is their approach valid?\nCandidate: No, I don’t think we could hit the same number. Their consumer base is more likely to overlap with NASCAR audiences (shaving versus teeth cleaning). Also, I would need to know more about their approach to know if it’s valid.\nInterviewer: They have NASCAR branded products with total sales of $100M,\nCandidate: Their approach is not valid since we are thinking about sponsoring a NASCAR team to sell more of our original product whereas they are selling a new product.\nInterviewer: What might be some of the issues associated with their approach to leveraging NASCAR?\nCandidate:\n• Cannibalizing sales of their other products (people buying NASCAR branded shaving blades as opposed to Fusion blades).\n• Marketing spend required to launch NASCAR branded products.\n• Alienating potential customers (those who are not NASCAR fans).\nInterviewer: Taking Gillette’s results, and making some assumptions about how we would compare, how would you determine whether we should pursue this?\nCandidate: I would look at ROI (return on investment). Initial investment of $20M + some other costs, such as other advertising, legal, etc. (Make sure candidate addresses that there are costs beyond the $20M, but don ‘t go in depth. Just call it X.)\nFor the return, I would make these assumptions (it really doesn’t matter) to come up with incremental revenue of Y. While incremental revenue is nice, what’s really important here is the incremental profit, so I would back out COGS, which makes\nour ROI quite small (or possibly negative depending on the numbers and assumptions).\nNote: It is not important to calculate the numbers as much as it is important for the candidate to show that they understand the various financial “buckets” and can explain ROI clearly.\nInterviewer: So what would you tell the president of Colgate?\nCandidate: I would recommend not doing the NASCAR sponsorship. Not target consumer, ROI is fairly low, and it’s a huge part of our total marketing budget. \nNote: it is good if the candidate comes back to the implied reason why the company wanted to get involved with NASCAR: to\ntarget this particular population (largely male, between 25-55, living in suburban and rural locations) and perhaps offers other ways to reach this market such as providing free samples at NASCAR events, placing ads in magazines targeting this particular niche, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The company was founded in 1889 as Washington Water Power Company, until the board of directors approved a name change to Avista Corporation 1999. It is headquartered in Spokane, Washington.\nThe client Avista Utilities’ business is regulated by the Washington state government, which allows it to earn a maximum of 10% of assets as income. Our client’s capacity is 1 million megawatt hours (MWH) per year. The government recently mandated that our client generate 10% of its annual capacity from renewable energy sources. The company has two options: (1) buy green credits from a 3rd party and (2) set up a wind farm.\nWhat should our client do?\nPossible Answer:\n1. Economics of each option\nBehind the scenes: Let the interviewee come up with a framework, which should emphasize evaluation of costs/benefits for each option. Competition or market issues should not be relevant since the client is a heavily regulated monopoly. Ideally, the framework should address internal capabilities.\nExample starting framework:\n\n\n\nCost/Benefit\nSet up Wind Farm\nBuy Green Credits\n\n\nUpfront costs\nLand, Construction, Equipment, Transmission system\nTrading desk, New technologies (IT)\n\n\nOngoing costs\nMaintenance\nCredits, Staff\n\n\nBenefits\nIncrease revenue potential with asset base growth, Green perception in market\nFlexibility, No capital costs\n\n\nRisks\nVariability of wind, New / disruptive technologies\nNo reliable market, Limited information on value, Future supply unknown\n\n\n\nThe interviewer should suggest focusing on costs for this first part of the case; ask the interviewee what they would like to know about costs.\nInterviewer: What would you want to know to analyze the options?\nCandidate:\nSet up Wind Farm\n• Cost of building wind farms ($2,000 per MWH)\n• Life of wind farm (30 years)\n• Maintenance cost (assume $0 for simplicity)\nBuy Green Credits\n• Cost of credits ($20 per MWH)\n• Change in credit costs over time (price has increased from $5/MWH two years ago)\nInterviewer: For each option, could you figure out how much it would cost the client a year to fulfill the government’s mandate? (Note – ideally candidate will pro-actively volunteer to go in this direction)\nCandidate:\nRenewable energy source requirement is 10% –> either purchase green credits for 100,000 MWH or build a wind farm with that capacity.\n(1) Buy green credit: 100,000 MWH * $20/MWH = $2M per year\n(2) Build wind farm: 100,000 MWH * $2,000/MWH / 30 years = $6.7M per year (assuming straight-line depreciation)\nInterviewer: Assume the cost of implementing either option is absorbed entirely by the consumers through utility rate hikes. If the client buys green credits, utility rate charged to the consumers will be increased from $0.10 to $0.11.\nWhat could we expect the rate to be if the client were to set up a wind farm?\nCandidate:\nFor green credit purchase, $2M in cost translates into a 10% increase in utility rate.\nThe wind farm costs $6.7M –> the increased utility rate would be ($6.7M / $2M) * 10% * $0.10 + $0.10 = $0.133\nInterviewer: Can you comment on profitability implications of each option?\nCandidate: Under option #1, which is to purchase the green credits, we know that all costs would be absorbed by the consumers so profitability would be unchanged. This is certainly true for option #2 building a wind farm as well, but what’s interesting is that our asset base has increased due to the capital investment for the wind farm. This would lead to a bigger allowance for income earned (the client earns a maximum of 10% of its assets as income).\n2. Qualitative Assessment\nBehind the scenes: This section of the case focuses on qualitative benefit/risk profiles of each option. It would be great if the interviewee suggests going down this path, but it’s fine to ask the question directly as well. Ideally, this part of the case interview would include internal capability factors, green factors, and governmental view.\nInterviewer: What do you think are the most important pros and cons of each option?\nCandidate:\n\n\n\nOption\nPros\nCons\n\n\nGreen Credits\n\n\nLimited capital commitment;\nEasy and quick to implement;\nEasy to scrape if regulation changes\n\n\n\n\nExposure to market uncertainty (400% increase in price in the last two years from $5 to $20). May not be able to pass all costs to consumers in the future;\nQuick fix (not actually green power source in the state)\n\n\n\n\nWind Farm\n\n\nImprove company’s image by being green (taking big step) to consumers and to government;\nCreate more jobs for the state by essentially setting up a new business;\nPotentially earning more income now that total assets are bigger (i.e., get more for the 10% cap on earnings on assets)\n\n\n\n\nLarge upfront investment;\nRequire additional expertise and internal capabilities to develop;\nRisk of investment becoming obsolete if government eliminates requirement\n\n\n\n\n\nInterviewer: What might the government not like about building a wind farm?\nCandidate:\nAlthough it is green, it results in a higher rate hike (government officials who are under political pressure may not like this). On top of that, being able to earn more income now that total assets are bigger, the client may push to sell more electricity, which may conflict with the government’s goal of limiting energy consumption.\n3. Wrap-up\nBehind the scenes: The ideal answer is a hybrid model. However, it is fine to pick either option as long as the interviewee gives compelling reasons.\nInterviewer: So, what would you recommend?\nCandidate:\n(1) A hybrid model: Look into buying green credits to fulfill the requirement in the short term and investigate the possibility of building a wind farm.\n• This is superior because the company has an option of switching to the wind farm if credit price goes up.\n• The client company can buy time to develop internal capability to build a wind farm.\n(2) Set up a wind farm\n• Sustainability is increasingly becoming an important issue so risk of regulation being reversed is very small.\n• More environmentally friendly and will generate positive PR.\n• Could be used to make existing operation more efficiently (i.e., add capacity during peak hours) to mitigate effect of higher rate hike.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: reduce costs.\nConsulting Firm: Roland Berger Strategy Consultants first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: household goods, consumer products; manufacturing.\nCase Interview Question #00952: Our client Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. (NYSE: SWK) is an industrial tools and household hardware conglomerate. DeWalt, one of their business subsidiaries, manufactures two lines of products: nail and staple guns, and the fasteners used by the guns. DeWalt’s annual revenues are USD $1 Billion. The Fastener product line accounts for 70% of revenues and the Tools product line accounts for 30% of revenues. All products are currently manufactured and sold in the U.S. Sales come through three channels:\n(1) Construction supply stores;\n(2) Direct-to-Manufacturer sales;\n(3) Home centers (e.g., Home Depot, Staples).\nThe company has seen profit margins fall from 10% to 5% and they are still declining. Our client Stanley Black & Decker, the corporate parent company, would like us to figure out what the maximum potential profit is for DeWalt.\nPossible Answer:\n1. Suggested Structure\nFirst review the market to gain understanding of the competitive landscape. Then jump into the company’s profit tree. Then step back to think about the company’s place within the conglomerate’s portfolio and any potential implications.\n2. The Market\nWhat do we know about the client’s competitive position?\nMarket Share: In tools, the client owns 40% market share and is holding steady relative to industry growth (about 3%). Client is the market leader and has a great brand reputation. In fasteners, the client owns 20% market share and is seeing that decline by about 2 percentage points/year, while the market grows at about 3%. The client is one of two top players who alternate in the market lead.\nCandidate can then infer that the tool market size:\n$1B (company revenue) * 30% = $300M\n(Total Tool Market Size) * 40% (client’s tool market share) = $300M\nTotal Tool Market Size = $300M/0.4 = $750M\nAnd the fastener market size:\n$1B (company revenue) * 70% = $700M\n(Total Fastener Market Size) * 20% (client’s fastener market share) = $700M\nTotal Fastener Market Size = $700M/0.2 = $3.5B\nAdditionally, the candidate can note that the client’s performance in the tool business is in line with the market, but it seems like there’s something happening on the fastener side to cause the client to lose market share. What’s causing this?\nHave the candidate brainstorm different possibilities (price competition, technological improvements, competition should all be touched on). The interviewer should reveal that generic fastener guns are gaining share from the client.\nCandidate can then infer that generics are priced lower than fasteners, the interviewer confirms that generics are 25% cheaper than the client’s fasteners. This is largely a commodity market so the lower price is effective at grabbing market share from the client’s known brand.\n3. The Client’s Profit Equation\nInterviewer can suggest that we just look at fasteners since it seems like nothing much is happening with the tools side. We already calculated the client fastener revenue = $700M.\nNext, let’s look at the cost side of the equation. What do we know about fixed costs? The client’s plant in the U.S. is very expensive and generates a lot of overhead. Our total manufacturing cost for fasteners is 80% of revenues. The candidate calculates 80% of $700M is $560M.\nInterviewer: What options might we have for lowering that cost? Stops the candidate once off-shoring has been suggested. Notes that generic competitors’ operations are in Asia. The candidate suggests we could examine moving our operations to Asia, too.\n4. Cost Analysis\nInterviewer: Moving operations to China is an available option, how would we think about the cost savings? Interviewer says not to worry about fixed/startup costs.\nCandidate identifies cost areas, ultimately being categorized as (1) Materials; (2) Labor; (3) Freight; (4) Overhead.\nThe interviewer should share the following cost data.\n\n\nCost Components\nU.S．\nChina\n\n\nMaterials\n 50% of cost\n 50% of U.S. cost\n\n\nLabor\n 20% of cost \n90% cheaper than U.S.\n\n\nFreight\n 10% of cost \n3 x price of U.S.\n\n\nOverhead\n 20% of cost \nSame as U.S.\n\n\nCandidate runs calculations, determines\n\n\nCost Components \nU.S．\nChina\n\n\nMaterials\n $560*50% = $280M\n $140M\n\n\nLabor \n$560*20% = $112M\n ~$10M\n\n\nFreight\n $560*10% = $56M\n$56M*3 = $168M\n\n\nOverhead \n$560*20% = $112M\n $112M\n\n\nTotal \n$560M \n$430M\n\n\nCandidate concludes that China option would save $560-$430 = $130M per year. Candidae should now calculate change in profit margin.\nProfit margins has fallen from 10% to 5%. We know that profits today must be $50M (since $1B * 5% = $50M). Assuming all the calculated cost savings ($130M) will go right to the bottom line, that means profits will now be $50+$130 = $180M. Therefore if revenues remain flat at $1B, there will be an increase in profit margin from $50M/$1B = 5% to $180M/$1B = 18%\n5. Other Considerations\nThe interviewer asks the candidate what other considerations come into play. Candidate suggests revisiting original structure to think about portfolio impact. Are there synergies to be realized or lost by this move to China, vis-a-vis conglomerate’s other portfolio companies? Looking elsewhere, the move overseas puts a higher weight on freight costs, meaning that the company is more vulnerable to jumps in oil prices. Political factors also weigh in — this market may be especially sensitive to the idea of using American labor so the company’s brand image could be hurt by moving overseas.\n6. Final Recommendation\nRelocate manufacturing operations to China. However, other factors (both market-related and logistical) should be carefully considered.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: operations strategy; organizational behavior.\nConsulting Firm: Bridgespan Group first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: education, training services; government, public sector.\nCase Interview Question #00953: Our client New Orleans Public Schools (NOPS) is the public school system that serves all of New Orleans, Louisiana, United States. NOPS served approximately 64,000 students pre-Katrina. NOPS was the New Orleans area’s largest school district before Hurricane Katrina devastated the city in August 2005, damaging or destroying more than 100 of the school district’s 128 school buildings.\nThe year is 2007. New Orleans Public Schools has been completely devastated by Hurricane Katrina. The school district saw most of their students leave and relocate to nearby states after the hurricane. 2 years into the disaster, the students are now slowly returning back. The NOPS school district has hired us to advise them on two things:\n(1) What are the number of schools they need to immediately reopen, and\n(2) What can be done to better the quality of education?\nAdditional Information:\nLet the candidate drive the case. The candidate should, at this time, draw out a framework. Here is some of the information that a candidate may ask for. Provide this only if the candidate asks.\nMore about Public School System in New Orleans\n• Before Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans Public Schools (NOPS) ranked as one of the lowest performing school districts in the country.\n• The school district faced significant financial problems and was on the verge of bankruptcy.\n• There were 64,000 students that got displaced due to the hurricane.\n• There were 64 schools before the hurricane struck. 18 have been reopened since.\n• Approximately 24,000 students have already returned to the state.\n• About 1,600 students are returning every month.\nPossible Answer:\n1. Suggested Framework\nThe candidate should, at some point, draw out the framework\nEducation System:\na. Number of schools\n• Number of students\n• Capacity per school\nb. Quality of education\n• Quality of teachers\n• Current socio-economic needs\n2. Data and Solution\nInterviewer: The candidate at this point should be asked to calculate the number of schools that need to be re-opened.\nCalculations:\nBefore the hurricane, there were 64 schools accommodating 64,000 students. Assuming the new schools can have the same ratio of students per school, there would be 64,000/64 = 1,000 students per school.\n18 schools have reopened since –> 18 * 1,000 = 18,000 students can be accommodated.\nHowever, the number of students who have returned = 24,000\n–> Under-capacity for 24,000 – 18,000 = 6,000 students currently.\nAlso, every month 1,600 students are returning.\n–> By next month there will be an under-capacity for 6,000 + 2*1,600 (current month + next month) = 9,200 students\n–> By the end of next month, the school district should target to reopen 10 new schools (to accommodate 9,200 students).\n–> Beyond that, the school district would need to open approximately 2 schools per month to accommodate the 1,600 students that are returning every month.\nThe candidate should then move to the next half of the question about what can be done to improve the quality of New Orleans schools. lf the candidate is still working on the number of schools to be reopened, guide the candidate towards the question.\nThe candidate can be provided with the below information if asked:\nAdditional Information:\nBefore the hurricane, the school district statistics were the following:\n• For every 10 students who enroll in schools, fewer than 6 make it to graduation\n• Only 2 enroll in college\nGood candidates will want to go deeper into understanding this. There are no set answers here. The objective of this case is to see if the candidate can break down a problem statement to analyze the different causes that might be resulting in the problem.\nThe candidate should deduce that the school disirict should -\n1. Attract, develop and retain quality teachers, principals and school administrators.\n2. Improve the student teacher ratio to allow more individual attention.\n3. Engage students better by catering to courses that are more pertinent to today’s world. For example, look to introduce courses like computer education etc. that can give the students an edge in getting jobs in high-paying sectors. Also, offer education in areas like carpentry, masonry, nursing etc. that can allow students to learn skills that can prove helpful to find jobs in the market.\n4. Ensure adequate capacity in the schools.\n5. Experiment with new school models by setting up a Charter system allowing private groups and corporations to be involved.\n6. Benchmark best practices with other school districts.\n7. Get the community involved and have parental involvement in school activities. They could also be encouraged to volunteer time that could help especially in the early days when the school system is being revamped.\n8. Make information about the new changes available and advertise to ensure that the community supports and participates in the changes for the better.\n9. Grant some amount of autonomy to the schools in exchange for increased accountability, encouraging sharper focus on student achievement. This will also allow the schools the incentive to find creative ways to decrease spending in utilities and instead invest the money in instruction.\n10. Get local and national non-profit and/or corporate involvement. This will allow for funding to achieve the goals set.\nAny other creative ideas are also to be rewarded. The idea is to see that the candidate can think on the fly and think of the potential resolutions that the school district can investigate.\n3. Recommendation\nInterviewer: The client has asked us for our recommendation. What would you tell the client?\nHere is a possible response:\n• The number of students who have returned to the state far exceeds the capacity of the 18 schools that have reopened. Investments should be made to reopen 10 more new schools on an urgent basis.\n• With the rebuilding, there exists a potential to revamp the education system to make it more engaging and useful to find jobs. This can be done while ensuring the quality of education is improved by attracting and retaining high quality teachers and principals.\n4. Additional Considerations\nInterviewer: What are some of the potential risks?\nHere are some potential answers:\n• For a community that is rebuilding itself, costs can be a constraint. However, it can be also viewed as an opportunity to get endowments to fund the plans.\n• The possibility that media and community might focus on the negatives especially if the school district cannot provide adequate capacity in the schools quickly enough for the returning student body. In such a case, students might be dissuaded from returning causing more harm to the school district. Forging relationships with the local media to cover the advancements and achievements of the schools will be a way to mitigate the risks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new product; pricing & valuation.\nConsulting Firm: McKinsey & Company 2nd round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: automotive, motor vehicles.\nCase Interview Question #00894: Our client is the CEO of Mack Trucks Inc., an American truck manufacturing company headquartered in Greensboro, North Carolina, United States. Mack Trucks is a subsidiary of Swedish automobile manufacturer AB Volvo which purchased Mack along with Renault Trucks in year 2000.\nMack Trucks sells mostly to logistics services companies. Mack Trucks’ main current product is a truck called Evolution. Now they came up with a new Maxidyne high-torque rise engine, and they want to start selling another type of truck, called Revolution, that will use this new Maxidyne engine. The only difference between Revolution and Evolution is the engine and Mack Trucks’ plan is to have both Evolution and Revolution in the market. The CEO has hired McKinsey & Company to help him find out a pricing strategy for Revolution.\nPossible Answer:\nPart 1: Brainstorm on customer needs\nBehind the scenes: Try to get as many good customer needs as possible, so keep asking what else until you have a good list. The candidate should use a clear structure, e.g. Driver Needs, Purchaser Needs, Maintenance Needs (user change).\nInterviewer:\nWhat do you think customer’s main considerations are when comparing the two models? When deciding which one to buy?\nPossible Answers:\nPrice, Fuel efficiency, Durability, Maintenance costs, etc.\nPart 2: Pricing – qualitative analysis\nBehind the scenes: Let the candidate mention different pricing strategies. If they say “Let’s see competitors’ price”，tell the candidate nobody has a similar model and ask for other methods.\nInterviewer: How would you come up with a price for the new truck?\nPossible Answer:\n• Analyze competitors’ price: In this case nobody has a similar model, so N/A.\n• Cost-based pricing (cost + mark-up)\n• Value-based pricing (customers value): Paramount to understand how much value we are bringing to the customer.\nPart 3: Pricing -quantitative analysis\nBehind the scenes: Don’t give all information upfront. Hold the information about price of fuel until the candidate asks for it. Candidate may assume zero cost of capital, but can’t do math simplifications.\nInterviewer: Our current truck, Evolution, sells for $100,000. Here is a quick comparison between the Evolution and the Revolution trucks:\n\n\n\n\nEvolution\nRevolution\n\n\nFuel efficiency:\n5 km/L\nCan do 20% more kilometers with same fuel.\n\n\nUseful life:\n4 years\n4 years\n\n\nSalvage value:\nSame for both\n\n\n\n\n• On average, logistics services companies trucks drive 150,000 km per year.\n• Price of fuel: $1.50/L\nHow much do you think we could sell Revolution for?\nPossible Answers:\nIn four years, the expected fuel costs for customers are:\n• Evolution: 4 * (150,000 km / 5 km/L) * $1.50/L = $180,000\n• Revolution: 4 * (150,000 km / 6 km/L) * $1.50/L = $150,000\nSo the difference is $180,000 – $150,000 = $30,000\nTherefore, assuming everything else is the same, we could charge up to $100,000 + $30,000 = $130,000 for the new Revolution truck.\nPart 4: Market survey\nBehind the scenes: Let the candidate ask for the costs, don’t give them upfront. If candidate forgets, remind him that Evolution sells for $100K.\nInterviewer: In order to get a better sense of the market, Mack Trucks did a survey and came up with the following results as an estimate for demand in the next years:\n\n\n\nIf Revolution was sold at a price of:\n$100K\n$115K\n$130K\n\n\n% customers buying Revolution:\n90%\n80%\n40%\n\n\n% customers buying Evolution:\n10%\n20%\n60%\n\n\n\nAssuming the survey is representative, which of these three prices would you choose for Revolution?\nBehind the scenes: Here the interviewer should stop for a while and wait to see what the candidate does. Candidate could try to analyze, but he/she must ask about costs because the goal is to maximize profits, not revenues.\nAdditional Information:\nFixed costs are the same for both Revolution and Evolution, but because Revolution has a more complex engine, it costs Mack Trucks $10,000 more to produce each Revolution truck.\nPossible Answers:\nWe wouldn’t sell for $100K. Since there is a $10K extra costs associated with producing Revolution, at $100K it’s better to only sell Evolution.\nAt $115K, extra profits from selling Revolution would be 80 * ($115K – $100K – $10K) = $400K per hundred trucks sold\nAt $130K, extra profits from selling Revolution would be 40 * ($130K – $100K – $10K) = $800K per hundred trucks sold\nTherefore, it is better to sell Revolution truck for $130K.\nObservation: It’s not necessary to know the market size in order to conclude that $130K is the better choice.\nPart 5: Final brainstorm\nInterviewer: Why do you think some people would still buy the old model even if the price was the same?\nPossible Answers:\n• Logistics companies don’t want to change all their new fleet before they test the new truck and confirm what the producer says about fuel efficiency.\n• Customers may fear that it would not be easy to find mechanics to fix the new engine when it broke.\n• There are no old Revolution engines available, so repair/replacement by third parties could be harder.\nObservation: The fact that the 150,000km figure is an average is not a valid reason given that the price is the same. Regardless of the annual usage, it would always be better to have the engine that is more fuel efficient.\nPart 6: Wrap-up\nInterviewer: The CEO of Mack Trucks is coming and you need to tell him what your conclusions are.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new product, new technology; investment; math problem.\nConsulting Firm: McKinsey & Company 2nd round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: textiles.\nCase Interview Question #00895: Your client is a leading carpet manufacturer based in the United States. They sell carpet to both commercial and residential customers. Their current production process is as follows:\n(1) Buy dyed/pre-colored yarn, (2) Load yarn spools in a specific order onto machine (3) Weave yarn into carpet (4) Run carpet through carpet backing machine (5) Cut, roll, and store the finished carpet\nYour client is considering investing in a new technology that will cost USD $25M (initial investment). With the new technology their carpet production process will change to the following:\n(1) Buy un-dyed yarn (2) Spool yarn (3) Weave yarn into carpet (4) Die carpet through a printing process, much like an inkjet printer (5) Cut, roll, and store the finished carpet\nThe client wants to know if they should invest in the new technology or not. What would you recommend?\nPossible Answer:\nPart 1: Differentiating current carpet from new carpet (if asked)\nCandidate: If I may clarify, will the carpet made with the new technology be different in any way from the current product?\nInterviewer: We can assume that the new carpet will have a better texture and can therefore be sold at a higher end offering.\nPart 2： What do you expect would be the likely impacts on our costs?\nPossible Answer:\n• Yarn costs decrease –> only buy un-dyed yarn\n• Ink costs increase\n• Labor decreases on spool loading\n• Maintenance costs of new machine\n• Electricity costs increase\n• Training costs for operating new machine\n• Warehousing costs decrease from ability to quickly make to order\nPart 3: What would you take into account to decide if this was a good investment?\nNote: Focus on the costs; look for an answer of valuing the cost savings. However, could you also increase your revenue by selling the carpets at a higher price point?\nInterviewer: “We have aggregated the changes in costs, and it turns out that we will save 25 cents per finished yard of carpet. How would you value the investment?”\nAdditional Information: Provide the following data when asked\n• We produce 10 Million yards of finished carpet per year.\n• The machine has a 10 year useful life.\nPossible Answer:\n10M yards * $0.25 savings = $2.5M savings per year.\n$2.5M per year * 10 years = $25M total savings.\nRecognize the time value of money, so this wouldn’t really break even in today’s dollars just based on cost savings. Not to mention that we’re not taking into account the maintenance costs of the machine, as well as the ink itself.\nInterviewer: “So what would you have to believe in order to justify this investment?”\nPossible Answers:\n• We would be able to sell for a higher price, and increase revenue.\n• We would be able to win market share from our competitors, and increase revenue.\n• We would be able to serve new markets, and increase revenue.\n• We would be able to be more flexible in our product offerings, since we can dye the yarn on demand, instead of forecasting which pattern will be the most successful.\nPart 4: It turns out we can sell the new, higher quality carpet for $20/yard, which is a 25% premium over the standard carpet. We would still be able to produce and sell the standard carpet as well. What types of things would you think about in this scenario?\nPossible Answers:\n• Cannibalization of old customers\n• New customers that you couldn’t previously serve\nPart 5: It turns out we have done market research, and now we know that 30% of our existing customers would upgrade to the new carpet. Also, there is a 70M yard/year market for higher quality carpet that we couldn’t sell to previously. We estimate that we could capture 5% of that high end market. What would the incremental revenue be given we start selling the high quality carpet?\nPossible Answer:\n• Standard carpet price must have been $20/(1+25%) = $16 per yard\n• We’re told that we produce 10M yards of finished carpet, so we will assume that all 10M yards are sold –> 30% are cannibalized, so we now will sell only 7M yards of the standard carpet.\n• New carpet sales: 3M + 3.5M (5% of 70M higher quality carpet) = 6.5M\n• Old revenue: 10M * $16 = $160M\n• New revenue: 7M * $16 + 6.5M * $20 = $112M + $130M = $242M\n• Incremental revenue = $242M – $160M = $82M\nPart 6: Given this new information, what would you say about the net incremental revenue from this new technology?\nPossible Answer:\nWe are now selling 3.5M yards more than before so there would be an additional production cost. This would be the difference between the production cost of 10M yards of standard carpet, and 7M standard and 6.5M new carpet.\nTo calculate the NET incremental revenue, they will need cost figures. When prompted, provide the candidate:\n• The cost per yard of the original carpet was $10/yard\n• The cost per yard of the new carpet is $10 – $0.25 = $9.75/yard\nOld production costs: 10M * $lO/yard = $100M\nNew production costs:\n• Standard carpet: 7M * $10/yard = $70M\n• New carpet: 6.5M * $9.75/yard = $65M – $1.6M (roughly) = ~$63.4M (exactly $63.375M)\n• Total costs: $70M + $63.4M = $133.4M\nTherefore:\n• Net incremental costs: $133.4M – $100M = $33.4M\n• Net Incremental Revenue: $82M – $33.4M = $48.6M per year\nPart 7: Wrap-up: Ask the candidate to make a final recommendation\nPossible Answer:\nI would suggest going forward with the acquisition of the new machine. We can definitely tap into a new high-end market, and can make additional $48.6M net revenue per year. I would look into the expected maintenance costs, and verify the cost trend for the ink itself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: investment.\nConsulting Firm: Boston Consulting Group (BCG) first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: healthcare: hospital & medical; non-profit organization.\nCase Interview Question #00896: Our client is the World Health Organization (WHO). The WHO is a specialized agency of the United Nations that is concerned with international public health. It was established in April 1948, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. Since its creation, the WHO has played a leading role in the eradication of smallpox. Its current priorities include communicable diseases, in particular HIV/AIDS, Ebola, malaria and tuberculosis.\nEach year the World Health Organization receives USD $2.5 billion in grants to reduce the incidence of disease in developing nations. Every year, they allocate 20% of this budget to fighting malaria. 80% of their malaria budget goes toward R&D and 20% to onsite implementation.\nA few facts about malaria: Approximately 50% of the world’s countries are considered “at risk”, which means malaria is common among the population. The biggest problem is in Sub-Saharan Africa. In this region, the disease has a 40% incidence rate among children under the age of 5. However, children who live past the age of 5 usually acquire immunity to the disease by this stage of their life.\nIt is early 2016, and the WHO malaria team has just found out that for this year, and this year only, their budget will be increased by 20%. These additional funds could be invested into the purchase and distribution of bed nets, or they could be used to further R&D on a malaria vaccine with a robust pipeline. The team is equally divided between these two options and has brought Boston Consulting Group (BCG) in to help them decide how to invest the additional funds. What would you recommend?\nPossible Answer: \nNote: While drawing their structure, the candidate should have already calculated that additional malaria team funds amount to $2.5 billion * 20%  * 20% = $100 million. The key to the case is to compare each option and determine which can save the greatest number of lives. Impact on the number of lives saved should be included in the candidate’s structure.\nPart 1: Sub-Saharan African demographics\nAdditional Information: the following information can be provided if requested by the candidate.\n• Total population of Sub-Saharan Africa is 800M.\n• Average life expectancy is 50 years.\n• Roughly 10% of the population falls into the 0-5 age group.\nBehind the Scenes: The candidate can calculate the population of the 0-5 age group in one of two ways. If they ask for the percentage, then they can simply multiply 800M by 10% to get 80M children aged 0-5 years old.\nIf they ask for life expectancy, they can divide 800M by 50 years, and then multiply by 5 to get 80M.\nPart 2: Determining the benefits of bed nets\nBehind the Scenes: Once the candidate has the above information, they should move to evaluate the impact of investing in either bed nets or the malaria vaccine. It does not matter which they start with, but they should be clear that they wish to do a side-by-side comparison before the following information is provided.\nCandidate: I’d like to start by evaluating the bed nets. Do we have any information on how effective bed nets are?\nInterviewer: There are two factors that contribute to the usefulness of bed nets. Efficacy is 40%, which is the frequency with which they yield the desired result. There is also a compliance rate, which is the frequency that the bed nets are actually used. The compliance rate is unfortunately only 50% because once they are distributed families often use them for other purposes or don’t use them at all.\nCandidate: Do we know how much each bed net costs?\nInterviewer: They are $5 each. That includes everything – purchase from the manufacturer, shipping, and distribution.\nCandidate: OK, so $100M divided by $5 = 20M bed nets\nKey Insight: The candidate should note that 20M bed nets is only enough for 25% of 0-5 year old population (80M).\nCandidate: 20M bed nets * 40% efficacy * 50% compliance rate * 40% incidence rate = 1.6M cases averted. How long do bed nets last?\nInterviewer: They last for 2 years.\nCandidate: OK, 2 years * 1.6M cases averted equals a total of 3.2M cases of malaria averted if we invest the $100M into bed nets.\nPart 3: Determining the benefits of vaccine R&D\nCandidate: What information do we have about the vaccine pipeline?\nInterviewer: The vaccine will be ready for launch 4 years from now.\nCandidate: Do we know the efficacy and compliance rates for the vaccine?\nInterviewer: Studies show that the vaccine will have an 80% efficacy rate. Can you tell me your intuition about the compliance rate?\nCandidate: Sure. How would the vaccine be administered and in how many doses?\nInterviewer: The vaccine can be taken orally and only a single pill is required.\nCandidate: Compliance rate would likely be close to 100% then since clinicians can ensure that the pill is taken properly and the patients do not need to return for additional doses. Do we have any information about how much the vaccine will cost?\nInterviewer: The cost is $30 per vaccine, but our $100M investment will only cover research and development (R&D) costs. However, if we fund the research, another organization, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, has agreed to denote an additional $150M dedicated to the production and distribution of the vaccine.\nCandidate: $150M / $30 = 5M doses of vaccine.\n5M doses * 80% efficacy * 100% compliance * 40% incidence = 1.6M cases averted\nKey Insight: The candidate should realize that because the vaccine provides lifelong protection, more cases could be averted if the vaccine is administered when children are younger. If the candidate asks, the vaccine can be administered safely when the child is as young as one year old. The vaccine will then protect them for an additional 4 years of their life while they are still susceptible to the disease, so 1.6M/year is multiplied by 5 years to get a total of 8M cases of malaria averted.\nAdditional Insight: While this is not a traditional business case, a cost-benefit analysis can be used. After analyzing the two options the candidate may also want to think about how bed nets and the vaccine fit in with the WHO’s central mission and knowledge, and what other organizations in the space are doing.\nPart 4: Final Recommendation\nKey Insight: The candidate should recognize that neither approach is a cure-all for malaria since a large proportion of 0-5 year old population remains unprotected. However, investing the $100M in either approach would have a significant impact on saving lives.\nRecommendation: The final recommendation will depend on whether the candidate gets the key insight for vaccine administration. Recommendation should be direct and include both analysis and recognition of other factors (mission alignment, etc). \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "url": "http://www.consultingcase101.com/aa-to-offer-wireless-internet-service-in-international-flights/",
        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new business; pricing.\nConsulting Firm: IBM Global Business Services (GBS) 2nd round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: telecommunications & network; airlines.\nCase Interview Question #00897: Our client American Airlines, Inc. (AA) is a major global airline company headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, United States. Operating an extensive international and domestic network, American Airlines is the world’s largest airline by fleet size and revenue, and the second largest by number of destinations served, after United Airlines. As of June 2015, American Airlines operates a mainline fleet of 941 aircraft.\nRecently, American Airlines wants to introduce wireless Internet services in its international flights (i.e., flights between U.S. cities and non-U.S. cities). While other airline companies already provide wireless services for U.S. domestic flights, different technology is required for flights over water (i.e., no access to wireless towers on land). Currently, there is only one vendor available in the market that provides a new technology that allows wireless Internet over water. The client American Airlines wants to know at what price they should deploy this service in its international flights.\nPossible Answer:\n1. Suggested Framework\nThe candidate should prepare a simple framework which includes the following issues.\n• Customers: willingness to pay (WTP), customer segmentation, customer needs\n• Profitability: revenues, fixed costs, variable costs\n• Risks\n2. Additional Information\nThe candidate should ask about the customer’s willingness to pay (WTP) for the wireless service.\n• 30% of passengers are WTP if price is under $5/hour\n• 15% of passengers are WTP if price is under $10/hour\n• 5% of passengers are WTP if price is under $20/hour\nCandidate should ask for fixed and variable costs.\n• Investment of $600,000 per airplane for installation and access to wireless technology\n• $4/user hour (includes all variable costs)\nCandidate should also ask about the number of airplanes, number of flights, number of passengers, capacity, etc.\n• One international flight can carry 500 passengers.\n• On average, international flights have 80% capacity -> 400 passengers.\n• Average international flight = 8 hours -> assume each user spends 3 hours online.\n• American Airlines has 500 airplanes flying internationally, each with 2 flights per day.\n3. Analysis\nIf they don’t on their own, direct the candidate to figure out the payback period of the alternative prices. To figure out how long it would take to cover investment of one airplane, the candidate should determine the optimal pricing for maximizing profit. In this case, charging less than $5/hour is not profitable. Considering the passenger’s WTP above, the client can either charge $9/hour or $19/hour to target 15% or 5% of passengers, respectively. The interviewer should prepare a table (in presentable format) similar to the one below:\n\n\n\nPrice\n$9/hour\n$19/hour\n\n\nProfit/hour\n$9/hour – $4/hour = $5/hour\n$19/hour – $4/hour = $15/hour\n\n\nProfit/passenger\n$5/hour * 3 hours = $15\n$15/hour * 3 hours = $45\n\n\nProfit/flight\n$15 * 15% WTP * 400 passengers = $900/flight\n$45 * 5% WTP * 400 passengers = $900/fight\n\n\nProfit/day\n$900/flight * 2 flights/day = $1,800/day\n$900/flight * 2 flights/day = $1,800/day\n\n\nDays required to break even\n$600,000 / $1,800 = 333 days\n$600,000 / $1,800 = 333 days\n\n\n\nKey insight the candidate should make on their own: The payback period is 333 days or about 1 year, regardless of whether the client charges $9/hour or $19/hour to its passengers. Annual profit after payback is about $330M ($1,800/day * 365 days * 500 planes = $328.5M).\n4. Recommendation\nThe investment in wireless service on international flights is attractive because the payback period is only 1 year and annual profit is about $330M afterwards. Revenue potential could be even greater due to the secondary effects of adding such a service – more passengers flying our airline, more passengers using the service, different pricing methods. There are some risks, including reliability of new technology and adoption by competing airlines.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new business; market sizing.\nConsulting Firm: IMS Health Consulting Group first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: healthcare: pharmaceutical, biotech, life sciences..\nCase Interview Question #00898: Our client Actavis (formerly known as Watson Pharmaceuticals and Actavis, plc) is a global pharmaceutical company focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing branded pharmaceuticals, generic and over-the-counter medicines, and biologic products. The company has global headquarters in Dublin, Ireland and administrative headquarters in Parsippany-Troy Hills, New Jersey, United States.\nActavis markets a portfolio of brand products through six franchises in key therapeutic categories including: Aesthetics/Dermatology/Plastic Surgery; Neurosciences/CNS; Eye Care; Women’s Health and Urology; GI and Cystic Fibrosis; and Cardiovascular Disease and Infectious Disease. The CEO of Actavis is interested in expanding into vaccines. Currently they have no vaccines on the market, but have a new flu vaccine in clinical trials. Estimate the market demand and give them a positioning strategy.\nPossible Answer: \nCandidate: Is this flu vaccine different from the one I get every year?\nInterviewer: Yes. We’ll talk about how it is different later; for now, assume that the current flu vaccine is a commodity with no differentiation. It must be given every year. This is the vaccine that the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the leading national public health institute of the United States) recommends that certain segments of the population get every year to prevent the seasonal flu and is either given via injection or nasal mist. Our vaccine is differentiated, and a number of other pharma companies have differentiated flu vaccines in their pipelines. All are in late clinical trials and none are on the market yet.\nCandidate: (Laying out a structure) OK, I’m going to look at this problem this way: Market Demand; Current Market; Future Market.\nFirst, we’ll look at the question asked, which is the demand for commodity flu vaccine. Next, we’ll use this to look at the current market and its growth, customers, buyers, and suppliers. Lastly, we’ll look at the future market to figure out our strategy. When we look at the future market, we’ll need to find out more about how the product is differentiated so we can look at who the customers are (and possible segmentation) and how this relates to our competitors.\nInterviewer: Sounds good to me.\nPart 1: Market Demand\nCandidate: Well, the current market is driven by the CDC’s recommendations on who is most at risk. I know I don’t get the shot every year, but I know other age groups are much more likely to. Let’s break it down by age.\nAssume 300 million people in the US. I’ll divide them into 6 age groups, each with 50 million people. The CDC recommends that the very young and very old get the vaccine, so we’ll assume 100% vaccination at the ends. I know that myself and my peers don’t often get the vaccine, so our rate will be lower and will likely be a minimum for people 30-60. Let’s see what this tells us about market size.\n\n\n\nAge Range\nPopulation (M)\n% Vaccinated\n# Vaccinated (M)\n\n\n0-15\n50\n100\n50\n\n\n15-30\n50\n50\n25\n\n\n30-45\n50\n10\n5\n\n\n45-60\n50\n10\n5\n\n\n60-75\n50\n50\n25\n\n\n75+\n50\n100\n50\n\n\nTotal\n300 M\n\n160 M\n\n\n\nSo I estimate the annual market demand is 160 million doses.\nPart 2: Current Market\nInterviewer: How do you think we could grow that number?\nCandidate: Well, the most room for growth is the middle. There’s also some room at the ends of the age range since the real rate is <100%, but that’s not as big a growth opportunity.\nThe first way would be to get people like me to get the shot. For a vaccine, the end user is not the buyer – the buyer is local, state, and federal health authorities and medical practitioners like doctors and hospitals. This means that direct marketing (like TV ads for Lipitor) probably won’t do us a lot of good because the end user isn’t buying the product. Instead, we could work with those health authorities to raise awareness of the flu vaccine and its importance for people in the middle age ranges, if not for themselves then for the safety of the young and old around them.\nLastly, the young and old are likely limited by distribution – moms who can’t get their infant to the doctor and the elderly who can’t get to a clinic easily. Thus, we could work with health authorities to increase access, maybe by having a mobile van that vaccinates at day cares and nursing homes.\nInterviewer: OK, what’s next?\nCandidate: Let’s talk about the current market. We’ve basically covered a lot of this already – our growth depends on working with public health authorities (and population growth), our buyers are medical people and health organizations, and we and our competitors all duke it out on price for very little margin.\nPart 3: Future Market\nCandidate: Let’s now look at the future marker. At this point, I really need to know more about the product. How exactly is our product different?\nInterviewer: You tell me. What are some ways that it could be differentiated?\n(Comment: This specific candidate had experience in the pharmaceutical industry, and therefore had some technical knowledge. If this is not the case for the current candidate, provide the information as is requested).\nCandidate: Well, current vaccine is delivered via nasal spray, prefilled syringe, or multiuse vial and a separate syringe, so one way would be a new delivery system. Also, the current flu protects against three strains of flu, so we could add strains to add protection. Though it’s unlikely, it could also be a longer lasting vaccine that protected for multiple years. It could have less side effects, not be egg-based (for people with egg allergies), or could have higher efficacy.\nInterviewer: Assume our differentiator is a new delivery system: our vaccine is a pill.\nCandidate: Is that different than our competitors’ new vaccines?\nInterviewer: Yes,they differentiate based on something different.\nCandidate: That’s great! That allows us to explore a few options:\n• Reach market segments that are currently hard to capture. For instance, some people don’t get the shot because they don’t like needles.\n• If our pill doesn’t require refrigeration like the current vaccine, we can lower costs by not having to use refrigerated equipment in the distribution chain.\n• A big part of flu vaccines COGS is the syringe or nasal inhaler itself – depending on how much the vaccine itself costs, this could have lower COGS than current vaccines.\nInterviewer: So what’s our strategy?\nCandidate: Let’s segment the market. If our COGS are higher than current products, health authorities have strapped budgets and want the low cost option for most people, but we’ll position our product as a higher cost option to serve the hard-to-reach segments that are currently under-served. If our overall COGS turn out lower, we might be able to lower price and expand into the existing commoditized market. It would take years for a competitor to get a similar product through development and clinical trials, so we’ve probably got a 5 year head start to take over the market. After that, it will be harder.\nInterviewer: That sounds good. Incidentally, besides reaching more of the population, why might health authorities like our product?\nCandidate: The pill might not require refrigeration, would prevent accidental needle sticks, would remove the high cost of disposing of biohazardous waste, and would be much faster to deliver.\nInterviewer: Great, thanks! \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new business; market sizing.\nConsulting Firm: Accenture first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: industrial equipment; aerospace, defense.\nCase Interview Question #00946: Our client Pratt & Whitney is a large industrial equipment manufacturer with global service operations. Headquartered in East Hartford, Connecticut, the company reported having 31,500 employees supporting more than 11,000 customers in 180 countries around the world (as of 2014). Pratt & Whitney’s revenue totaled $14.5 billion.\nPratt & Whitney’s global operations are organized into four business units: (1) airplane engines, (2) industrial cranes, (3) oil drilling equipment, and (4) recreational aircraft. What issues do you think are important to consider in assessing the key drivers, opportunities and risks for this company?\nPossible Answer:\nNote: This is a “two-part” case where the first part does not require a well-defined structure. If the candidate asks to make a structure at the very beginning, tell them there will be time for that later.\nPart 1: What issues do you think are important to consider in assessing the key drivers, opportunities and risks for this company?\nPossible Answers:\na. Key drivers\n• General economic factors (GDP growth, energy prices, commercial and residential construction market)\n• Natural resource availability.\n• Economic policies regarding oil exploration, airline industry regulation (FAA), etc.\nb. Opportunities\n• Trends across markets (our client company is 70% domestic, the other 30% includes emerging markets)\n• Synergies across the areas (e.g. aircraft engines w/ recreational aircraft, oil drilling equipment w/ industrial cranes, etc.)\nc. Risks\n• Issues in the suppliers’ industries\n• Competition\n• Customer concentration\n• Price volatility\nPart 2. Recreational aircraft are small airplanes like Cessnas that people fly for fun. The client’s recreational aircraft division was doing well in the 1980s, but started declining in the 1990s. The division was shut down in 2005. The people were moved to other divisions and the plant was closed. It is now 2015, and they are wondering whether they should get back into the recreational aircraft market or sell off the assets and get out for good. What do you think we should consider?\nPossible Answers:\nThe candidate should now make his/her own structure. The structure may include:\n• recreational airplane industry overview (current market opportunity, competitive landscape),\n• financials (startup costs, profit potential, etc),\n• business fit (internal capabilities, product resurrection vs. new product development, rationale for original closing vs. rationale for re-entry, potential synergies, existing plant assets),\n• potential risks.\nDirect the candidate to dive right into the profitability calculation.\nInterviewer: How would you go about figuring out the size of the recreational aircraft market?\nCandidate: Two ways: top down and bottom up.\nTop down requires determining how many players there are in the market and their sizes. It is probably only a few, Cessna and a few others, so we could determine their revenues and add them up to get the overall market size.\nAlternatively, a bottom up approach would start by estimating the number of pilots and planes in the US (make sure they get this approach before moving on).\nInterviewer: OK, I can tell you that 1% of the U.S. population has a pilot’s license. Of those, 1/3 has a high enough income to actually own a plane or part of a plane. Of those, 10% buy their own plane and the remaining 90% belong to flying clubs where they share ownership of a plane with other pilots. We can assume there are 10 pilots per plane in these flying clubs.\nCandidate: OK, so let’s determine the number of planes we expect could be sold per year.\n• U.S. population = 300M\n• 300M people * 1% = 3M pilots\n• 1/3 of 3M pilots = 1M pilots with high incomes\n• 10% of 1M = 100K planes bought by individuals\n• 90% of 1M = 900K members of flying clubs\n• 900K/10 people per plane = 90K planes bought by flying clubs\n• 100K + 90K = 190K planes in total\nNote: Candidate should ask how often planes are typically replaced or how long their useful life is.\nInterviewer: 20 years.\nCandidate: So if we round 190K planes to 200K and divide by 20 years, that’s 10K planes purchased per year.\nInterviewer: Great, now let’s figure out how many of those we would need to sell in order to make a profit.\nCandidate: In order to do that, I am going to need some information about our pricing strategy and cost structure.\nInterviewer: I can tell you that 10 years ago our fixed costs (this is for steady state, ignore extra costs to start up the plant again) were $450M per year. Our variable costs were $1.8M per plane. Our selling price was $2M per plane. We need to assume that the numbers would be higher today, so let’s assume they are 10% higher now.\nCandidate: Let’s calculate the number of planes that we would need to sell per year to breakeven.\n• If the price was $2M and now it’s 10% higher, that is $2.2M.\n• The cost per plane was $1.8M, so now it would be roughly $2M.\n• That means $200K profit per plane.\n• If our fixed costs were $450M, now they would be close to $500M.\n• To get the total number of planes we need to sell to breakeven, it’s $500M/$200K = 2,500 planes.\nGiven that the market is about 10K planes per year, we need to capture at least 25% market share to breakeven (a good candidate will observe this on his/her own).\nInterviewer: Do you think we can do that?\nCandidate: Any response will work, as long as the candidate provides good reasoning.\nInterviewer: What are some risks of re-opening the plant?\nCandidate: Our technology could be obsolete (10 years is a long time to let a plant sit), it may take a while to restart (maintenance, training employees, etc), we need to find trained personnel, the economy could go bad, fuel prices could skyrocket, FAA safety approval and/or flight testing could hold up the process, we could divert focus from other product areas. We would also want to consider opportunity cost (i.e., how much could we receive for selling off the plant).\nInterviewer: So, what’s your recommendation regarding whether to get back in this market?\nCandidate: The final recommendation should correspond to previous points raised, and should be concise and direct.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: pricing; business competition.\nConsulting Firm: A.T. Kearney 2nd round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: chemicals; engineering, construction.\nCase Interview Question #00945: Your client Dyno Nobel (ASX: IPL) is a manufacturer of explosives. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Incitec Pivot Limited. The company offers ammonium nitrate commercial explosives, initiation systems, and setup services for large blasting projects. Dyno Nobel operates in Australia, Canada, the United States, Africa, Indonesia, Mexico, South America, Papua New Guinea and Turkey. It has customers in the mining, quarry, construction, pipeline and geophysical exploration industries.\nRecently, one of Dyno Nobel’s long-term customers is approaching the end of a long-term contract and the customer has decided to put the work out for a competitive bidding process. The client has hired us to help determine how to handle the situation. What would you recommend?\nPossible Answer:\n1. Suggested Structure \nLet the candidate make their own structure. The structure should include the basic industry landscape areas, competitive strengths, degree of differentiation in the product/service offerings, deeper dive into % of revenues derived from each stream and customer, pricing, and possible strategies for how to handle the competitive bidding situation.\n2. Background Info\nCandidate should pro-actively seek out the following information by asking probing questions:\nAdditional Information:\n• The demolition market is broken into 2 main areas:\n– Big players like our client Dyno Nobel handle large scale projects like mines, quarries, etc.\n– Small players handle buildings.\n• There are 3 main players in large-scale projects, our client Dyno Nobel is one of them. The other 2 players do not offer setup services, and have lower quality initiation systems.\n• The market is split up 30% for each of the three top players; the remaining 10% is fragmented.\n• The customer we are discussing owns 2 coal mines (one in Kentucky, one in Wyoming).\n• The explosives industry has been growing at about half the GDP growth rate.\nKey Insight: When our client’s customer opens the work for competitive bid, there will likely be 3 main bidders. We need to understand their pricing and offering.\n3. Pricing Calculations\nBehind the scenes: The candidate should pro-actively move from the background info to questioning the existing pricing structure currently under contract with the customer and ways in which the competition may differentiate their offerings.\nCandidate: So do we know what our client Dyno Nobel is currently charging vs. what their competitors are currently charging? I would also be interested to know our margins on each.\nInterviewer: Our client charges $1,000/ton for ammonium nitrate, and $250/ton for the required initiation systems (setup services are free). The customer we are talking about uses 40,000 tons of ammonium nitrate/year. Margins are 20% for ammonium nitrate and 80% for initiation systems. Our competition is charging $950/ton for ammonium nitrate and $150/ton for initiation systems.\nCandidate: Well, first of all, our client is overpriced when compared to their competition. We can calculate the total revenue and profit as shown below.\n\n\n\nProduct\nPrice\nCustomer’s annual volume\nTotal revenue\nMargin\nProfit\n\n\nAmmonium Nitrate\n$1,000/ton\n40,000\n$40M\n20%\n$200/ton\n\n\nInitiation Systems\n$250/ton\n40,000\n$10M\n80%\n$200/ton\n\n\n\nKey Insight: Our client is charging a 2/3 higher initiation system price than their competitors and a slightly higher price for chemicals. This could hurt them in a competitive bid unless they have a value proposition to backup the higher price.\nInterviewer: Why do you think they can realize such a high margin on initiation systems?\nCandidate: Do they have a superior product and/or do they command a higher price because of their free setup services?\nInterviewer: Yes. Ammonium nitrate is pretty much a commodity, but our client has superior initiation systems and setup services that allow them to provide better control of the size of blast fragments. This saves the customer $16M a year in post-demolition processing costs.\nCandidate: Dividing $16M by 40,000 tons, shows that our client is saving their customer $400/ton in post-demolition costs. Therefore, the customer is getting an “effective” price of $850/ton ($1,000 + $250 – $400 = $850) vs. the competition’s price of $1,100/ton ($950 + $150 = $1,100).\n4. Recommendations\nInterviewer: So, what would you recommend our client do to ensure they remain successful when the competitive bid opens up?\nCandidate:\n• Our client Dyno Nobel should ensure that their customer is aware of the $400/ton ancillary benefit they receive from setup services and superior initiation systems.\n• They also should consider adjusting their ammonium nitrate price to $950/ton to match the competition.\n• Finally, they should continue focusing on R&D and setup services to retain their position as the technology and value-added service leader in initiation systems.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: operations strategy, optimization; new product.\nConsulting Firm: Boston Consulting Group (BCG)  2nd round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: healthcare: hospital & medical; pharmaceutical, biotech, life sciences.\nCase Interview Question #00944: Our client The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is the US Government agency that is primarily responsible for administering civilian foreign aid. The “technical” offices of USAID design and manage the technical and financial assistance that USAID provides to their local counterparts’ projects. This case concerns one particular USAID technical office — Health and Family Planning.\nExamples of projects assisted by USAID Health and Family Planning offices are projects for eradication of communicable diseases, strengthening of public health systems focusing on maternal-child health including family planning services, HIV-AIDS monitoring, delivery of medical supplies including contraceptives and HIV vaccines, and coordination of Demographic and Health Surveys.\nOne of the ongoing projects conducted by USAID Health and Family Planning Office is trying to incentivize pharmaceutical and biotech firms to develop treatments and vaccines for diseases that are prevalent in developing countries. However, the technical challenge is to identify where to focus as there are many possible diseases. How would you go about helping the client?\nAdditional Information:\nShow the candidate the following graph\nExhibit 1. Disease in the Developing World\n\nWhen asked, provide the following details:\n• DALY stands for disability-adjusted life year and is a measure of how much impact a disease has on people’s productivity. Diseases, which cause people to die young or which cause disability starting in childhood, have the highest DALY scores.\n• Pipeline indicates the number of drugs that are currently under development.\n• All these data are made up, as are some of the disease names.\nPossible Solution:\nQuestion #1: Which diseases represent the best opportunity for our client?\nPossible Answer:\nHIV and Hep represent the greatest disease burden for developing countries, but there are also many treatments already under development for these diseases, so our client probably doesn’t want to focus there. (It’s hard to incentivize more development, as the competition looks tough.) It probably makes more sense to focus on the three diseases with the next-highest disease burden: TB, Malaria, and Diarrheal Disease. Of these, I would recommend focusing on Diarrheal disease as there are the fewest products in the pipeline.\nQuestion #2: You’re right about diarrheal disease:  that is where the client decided to focus. What does this tell us about diarrheal disease?  (Show the candidate the second graph)\nExhibit 2. Etiology of Diarrheal Disease\n\nSource: Local population data (black bars) from field study surveys by a medical nonprofit in 7 developing countries. Military population data (white bars) from a sample of US soldiers stationed in Egypt.\nIf asked, provide the following details:\n• Etiology means the causes of the disease.\n• Antigen is a general term that can refer to anything which provokes an immune response, whether bacteria, virus, etc.\n• The Y-axis scale, incidence, indicates that 5% of cases are caused by Antigen A, and so forth. If someone adds up all the bars, he or she will realize that they don’t sum to 100%. This is because some cases are caused by antigens that have not yet been identified — so the picture is even worse.\n• Data are recent (last year) and the sample sizes are large: n = 1,500 for the local population data and n = 256 for the military data. Subjects in the local population data are children under the age of 18 years old. Subjects in the military data are soldiers of all ages.\nPossible Answer:\nIt is not caused by a single primary antigen, but can be caused by a large number of different “bugs”. This means that developing a treatment or vaccine will be difficult because it can’t just attack one of the antigens, it will need to be effective across a large number of them. This helps explain why there are so few current treatments and vaccines available to treat diarrheal diseases. It’s like the flu or the common cold – similar symptoms but really not just one single pathogen that causes the disease, like is the case for small pox, for example. This is true both for the local population and the military population.\nQuestion #3: Who do you think would be the main customers if we could induce someone to produce a treatment or a vaccine for diarrheal disease?\nPossible Answer:\n• Governments of the countries where this disease presents a major problem.\n• Probably also some nonprofits who help provide healthcare in those areas.\n• International organizations, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) of the United Nations, International Red Cross.\n(Keep asking who else and provide hints until the candidate realizes that foreign tourists and the military would also provide significant sources of revenue for such a product.)\nQuestion #4: What are some of the issues or risks that the drug maker would face with each of these customers?\nPossible Answer:\nBoth governments and the military are attractive customers because they buy in large volumes, but because of that they have significant negotiating power. If the military decides not to buy, that single loss of a sale could cause the whole project to become unprofitable. The drug maker and the client should consider trying to set up pre-commitment contracts with the governments and the military.\n(Show the candidate Exhibit 3)\nExhibit 3. Prescribing Patterns in Market 1 vs. 2\n\nQuestion #5: Assume that this is the prescribing data for a product like the one that our client is considering helping launch for diarrheal disease. Assume that market 1 and market 2 are two different geographic markets. What does this show and which market seems like a better target?\nPossible Answer:\nThe chart shows the physicians in each market arranged by their prescribing level of this product horizontally in descending order. So the physician who prescribes the most is on the left, and those who prescribe the least are on the right. The height of the line represents the cumulative total of all the units they have prescribed.\nThe candidate should recognize that Market 1 is basically more consolidated than Market 2. 80% of the units of this product are prescribed by about a third of the physicians in Market 1, but in Market 2 to account for 80% of the units we have to include more like 60% of the physicians.  One implication  of this is that it is probably easier to start selling a product that is similar to this one in Market 1 because fewer physicians would have to be informed about the new product. This means it’s an easier task to get penetration in Market 1, and we might want to start there.\nQuestion #6: So, what is your recommendation?\nAny well thought out recommendation based on the data presented will be fine.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: private equity & investment.\nConsulting Firm: Accenture first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: agriculture, farming, aquaculture.\nCase Interview Question #00947: Our client Blum Capital Partners is an American private equity firm focused on leveraged buyout, growth capital and PIPE investments in small cap and middle-market companies across a range of industries. The firm is known for pioneering a hybrid private equity / strategic block investment strategy in public companies. The firm, which is based in San Francisco, was founded in 1975 by Richard C. Blum. The firm has raised approximately $4.5 billion since inception across four institutional private equity funds raised since 1998.\nOur client Blum Capital is deciding whether or not to invest in a dairy farm in Iowa. The dairy farm only produces milk. The client Blum Capital doesn’t have any investments in the dairy industry or in farming more broadly. Should they purchase this dairy farm? Why or why not?\nPossible Answer: \n1. Competitive Environment\nThe interviewer should reveal the following pieces of case information when asked a relevant question.\nAdditional Information:\nDairy farming is a localized market:\n• Bonus points for candidate who brainstorms why this might be true (e.g. spoilage during transport, government restrictions and co-operatives)\n• Our potential acquisition target competes with other dairy farms in the same area in Iowa.\nCompetitive sizes:\n• Our potential target has 10,000 cows\n• Competitor 1 has 7,500 cows\n• Competitor 2 has 2,500 cows\nMarket shares:\n• Our potential target produces 100 units of milk per cow\n• Competitor 1 produces 80 units per cow\n• Competitor 2 produces 50 units per cow\nNot all cows produce the same amount of milk (bonus points to the candidate for asking this question)\n• Cows produce more milk when they are happy – when they are more comfortable being milked and when they are milked faster.\nThe candidate should synthesize the above data into a chart such as this:\n\n\n\nFarm\n# of cows\nUnits/cow\nTotal units\nMarket share\n\n\nPotential Target\n10,000\n100\n1M\n> 50%\n\n\nCompetitor 1\n7,500\n80\n600K\nAbout 33%\n\n\nCompetitor 2\n2,500\n50\n125K\n< 10%\n\n\n\nKey Insight: Our potential target dairy farm has 50% of the local dairy market in terms of number of cows and ~60% of the market in terms of units of milk.\n2. Revenue Streams\nValue chain: Our potential target dairy farm’s milk is sent to a processor who makes cheese, yogurt, butter, etc. The processor must purchase all the milk produced by the dairy farms in its co-operative, and the price is set by the government at $16 per unit.\nKey Insight: Since the price is set, and the processor has to purchase all the milk produced by the farm, the limiting constraint on the revenue side is the amount of milk produced.\n3. Cost Drivers\nBehind the Scenes: After exploring the competitive market and the revenue streams, the candidate should move onto cost drivers.\nAdditional Information:\n• Costs include cows, machinery, machinery maintenance, labor, SG&A, land, cow feed, transportation, veterinarians, etc.\n• Primary variable cost is cow feed. Cow feed is $10 per 1 unit of milk. Candidate should ask whether he/she can assume all other variables costs are negligible.\n• Fixed costs scale with the size of the farm (the # of cows). The fixed costs for our potential target are $4M per year.\n4. Profitability Analysis\nProfits = Revenues – Costs\nProfits = (1M units * $16 per unit) – (1M units * $10 variable cost/unit) – $4M fixed cost = $2M\nProfit margin = $2M / $16M = 12.5%\nInterviewer: How would you think about whether or not this is a good profit margin?\nCandidate: How does this margin (12.5%) compare with competitors? How quickly would our client break even on this investment? How does this compare to the other companies in our client’s portfolio?\nInterviewer: Let’s say that the fixed costs scale with the size of the farm (# of cows). How does our profit margin compare to our competitors?\nCandidate: The selling price and variable costs are the same, and therefore our potential target has a higher profit margin, because they are able to produce more units of milk per cow. Competitor 1 is making about half the margin and Competitor 2 is losing money.\nCandidate could synthesize the data they have collected into a chart such as the one below:\n\n\n\nFarm\n# of cows\nTotal units\nTotal revenue\nScaling factor\nFixed costs\nVariable costs\nProfit\nProfit margin\n\n\nPotential target\n10,000\n1M\n$16M\n1\n$4M\n$10M\n$2M\n$2M/$16M = 12.5%\n\n\nCompetitor 1\n7,500\n600K\n$9.6M\n7,500/10,000 = 0.75\n$3M\n$6M\n$0.6M\n$0.6M/$9.6M = 6.25%\n\n\nCompetitor 2\n2,500\n125K\n$2M\n2,500/10,000 = 0.25\n$1M\n$1.25M\n-$0.25M\n-$0.25M/$2M = -12.5%\n\n\n\nKey Insight: If cows are happier because of a larger farm (perhaps more space to move around, etc), then this is a business where you will get higher margins with a larger farm. Our client may want to consider acquiring more than just one business or securing other land to expand.\n5. Risk Assessment\nInterviewer: What are some risks associated with acquiring this business?\nBehind the Scenes: The Candidate may consider developing a mini-framework to categorize the different types of risks (e.g. cost risks, revenue risks, regulatory risks, market risks, etc.)\nPossible Answers:\n• Uncertainty about the acquisition price – competition for the deal may drive up price.\n• Our client doesn’t have expertise in this sector (What if we can’t keep our cows happy enough to produce this much milk?)\n• Revenue uncertainties: Government could change the price of milk or the co-operative policies.\n• Cost uncertainties: price of feed, risk of cow disease.\n• Risk of change in consumer demand and preferences (substitutes to milk, people may want to switch to soy for health reasons, etc)\n6. Recommendation\nInterviewer: Please summarize your findings for our private equity client.\nBehind the Scenes: A good answer should have a strong recommendation along with next steps and potential risks.\nPossible Answer:\nThe client should acquire the dairy farm because it is an industry leader in market share (>50%) and operates with double the profit margin (12.5%) of its nearest competitor (6.25%). The client should proceed by performing further due diligence on the acquisition price (e.g. examine other profit multiple comparables) and carefully weighing the risks (e.g. lack of experience, lack of synergies with other portfolio investments, macro-economic trends in the dairy industry, etc). \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: improve profitability.\nConsulting Firm: Capital One first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: apparel, clothing, textiles.\nCase Interview Question #00948: Our client Allen Edmonds Shoe Corporation is an American shoe manufacturer based in Port Washington, Wisconsin. The company was established in Belgium, Wisconsin in 1922. Today it designs and manufactures shoes for women, men and children in the United States, as well as in Italy and the Dominican Republic.\nThe Allen Edmonds Shoe company sells its shoes to a range of retailers from national department stores like Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s, mass retail stores like Target and Walmart, and shoe retailers like Famous Footwear and Foot Locker. While the revenue for the children’s shoe segment has been increasing over the past few years, profits have been declining. The client has brought our consulting firm in to address this issue. What would you recommend the client do?\nPossible Answer:\nThe candidate should come up with a structure that addresses costs and possible increases in costs due to manufacturing, distribution or marketing. The candidate should also include product mix in the structure – profits may be decreasing because the mix of shoes sold has shifted towards lower margin models.\n1. Profitability & Trends\nAfter candidate has asked about product mix, prices and costs for shoes, provide the following charts:\nTable 1. Price/Pair\n\n\n\nYear\n2012\n2013\n2014\n\n\nBrand A\n64\n56\n56\n\n\nBrand B\n54\n51\n49\n\n\nBrand C\n33\n38\n46\n\n\n\nTable 2. Cost/Pair\n\n\n\nYear\n2012\n2013\n2014\n\n\nBrand A\n35\n37\n41\n\n\nBrand B\n31\n36\n38\n\n\nBrand C\n26\n28\n28\n\n\n\nPrice/pair is the revenue generated from selling shoes to the retailers and cost/pair is the fully-loaded cost associated with designing and manufacturing a pair of shoes. Candidate should calculate the profits for each brand in 2012 and in 2014 to compare how the profits have changed over the two years.\nExample calculation: (64-35)/64 = 45%\nProfit Margin/Pair\n\n\n\nYear\n2012\n2013\n2014\n\n\nBrand A\n45%\n34%\n27%\n\n\nBrand B\n43%\n29%\n22%\n\n\nBrand C\n21%\n23%\n39%\n\n\n\nThe candidate should ask about the types of shoes and the differences between them. If not, guide them to this. Let them know that Brand A and Brand C are casual shoes and Brand B is a formal shoe.\nKey Insights:\nThe client is likely decreasing prices for Brand A and Brand B because of decreasing sales volumes. Decreasing price is leading to eroding profit margins. On the other hand, the company has been able to increase price for Brand C and this has lead to increasing profit margin for that category. Since Brand A and Brand C are both casual shoes, there may be some cannibalization of sales, especially if Brand C offers similar appeal to kids at a lower price.\n2. Sales & Strategy\nThe Candidate should ask about sales volume for each brand to confirm the above hypothesis.\nTable 3. Sales Volume/Pair (000′s)\n\n\n\nYear\n2012\n2013\n2014\n\n\nBrand A\n295\n290\n280\n\n\nBrand B\n390\n390\n380\n\n\nBrand C\n36\n78\n96\n\n\n\nCandidate should calculate the total revenue in 2014. For example, 280,000 pairs * $56/pair = $17.1MM. Candidate should also calculate the % of revenue from each shoe brand for 2014 as well as for 2013 and 2012, as shown below in Table 4. Though general “guesstimation” of numbers may be legitimate.\nTable 4. Total Sales (MM)\n\n\n\nYear\n2012\n% of total sales\n2013\n% of total sales\n2014\n% of total sales\n\n\nBrand A\n295*64=18.88\n46%\n290*56=16.24\n42%\n280*56=15.68\n42%\n\n\nBrand B\n390*54=21.06\n51%\n390*51=19.89\n51%\n380*49=18.62\n47%\n\n\nBrand C\n36*33=1.188\n3%\n78*38=2.964\n8%\n96*46=4.416\n11%\n\n\nTotal\n41.128\n100%\n39.094\n100%\n40.9\n100%\n\n\n\nKey Insights:\nSales volumes are declining for Brands A & Brand B even though price is decreasing while there is significant growth in sales volume for Brand C despite the fact that price is increasing. Brand C accounts for a small portion of total sales, but the proportion is increasing relative to other brands due to sales decline for the other two brands.\nInterviewer: If you had $50MM to invest in one shoe brand only, which brand would you choose and why?\nCandidate: Brand C is the most attractive segment because:\n(1) there is increasing demand for the product and potential for greater sales growth;\n(2) it has become the most profitable amongst all brands and hold promise for enhanced profitability due to potential of increasing prices.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: increase revenues; reduce costs; industry analysis.\nConsulting Firm: Strategy& (formerly Booz & Company) first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: Tourism, Hospitality & Lodging.\nCase Interview Question #00929: Our client Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE: RCL) is a global luxury cruise company based in Miami, Florida, United States. It buys cruise ships and offers tours around the world to individuals on vacations. Currently Royal Caribbean is the world’s second largest cruise line operator, after  Carnival Corporation & plc. The company owns five cruise lines: Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, Azamara Club Cruises, Pullmantur Cruises, and CDF Croisières de France.\nRecently, the board of directors of Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. has noticed that the company’s ROIC (Return On Invested Capital) is not as the same level as competitors. We are the #2 player with USD $8 Billion in annual revenues and are half as big as the #1 player Carnival Corporation (operator of Carnival Cruise Line). Our client Royal Caribbean wants to know what strategy to use to obtain double digit ROIC in the next 2 to 3 years. How would you go about it?\nPossible Answer:\nInterviewer: So, how would you analyze this problem?\nCandidate: The candidate should first come up with a framework to approach the problem. A successful framework would look at both revenues and costs, the typical profitability framework (profits = revenues – costs).\nA good candidate will start by thinking about what the variables are in ROIC ( ROIC = (Revenue – Operating Costs) / Invested Capital )．If they do not know what ROIC is, guide them through it.\nNote to Interviewer: When prompted, the interviewer can reveal the following information about the client. Let the candidate calculate the ROIC.\nAdditional Information:\n• Revenues = $8B\n• Operating Costs = $7.25B\n• Invested Capital = $15B\nROIC calculation = ($8B – $7.25B) / $15B = 5%\nCandidate: If we want to improve ROIC to double digits (10% at least) we have to increase revenues or decrease operating costs, or try a combination of both.\nOption 1: Lower Operating Costs\nLet the lowered operating cost = X\nROIC = ($8B – X) / $15B = 10%\nSolving for X, X = $6.5B\nCost reduction required = $6.5B – $7.25B = -$0.75B\nCost reduction percentage = -$0.75B / $7.25B = -10% (approx.)\nCandidate: So, we would need to lower Operating Costs approximately 10% in order to reach double-digit ROIC.\nOption 2: Increase Revenues\nLet the increased revenue = Y\nROIC = (Y – $7.25B) / $15B = 10%\nSolving for Y, Y = $8.75B\nRevenue increase required = $8.75B – $8B = $0.75B\nRevenue increase percentage = $0.75B / $8B = 9% (approx.)\nCandidate: So, we would need to increase revenues by approximately 9% in order to reach double-digit ROIC.\nInterviewer: Prompt the candidate to draw a conclusion from his or her findings and to tell you what the next steps might be.\nCandidate: Since we need to either reduce our operating expenses or increase revenue by similar percentages (9% – 10%), perhaps it would make sense to address both.\nNote: A good candidate will refer back to their original structure and mention several alternatives such as looking at variable and fixed cost structure, promotions, new markets/routes, taking best practices from competitors, etc. Once the candidate has completed the brain storming exercise (which you should encourage and challenge), guide him or her to look at pricing.\nPart 2: Price Structure\nCandidate: Do we have any information on the price we charge vs. our competitors?\nInterviewer: We have average revenues of $250 per day on average per customer, compared to $260 for our competitors.\nCandidate: Is this the price we charge per ticket on the cruise?\nInterviewer: No, this is the revenues per customer, considering both the ticket and what the person spends on board.\nCandidate: Does the competitor target an income segment higher than our customers?\nInterviewer: No, consider that we target the same customers in terms of income.\nCandidate: Are we comparable to our competitors in terms of brand, quality of service?\nInterviewer: Yes, moreover, we are considered more “premium” than our competitor.\nCandidate: OK, so can’t we simply jack up the price paid up front? I would imagine that demand is pretty inelastic given that our customers have high incomes.\nInterviewer: When I did this project I imagined that, but actually this industry has a pretty elastic demand curve, even when it comes to rich people! In fact, we usually don’t fill up to capacity by selling at regular prices and then we discount prices heavily in the days or weeks immediately before each departure in order to reach full capacity.\nCandidate: AHA!!! But since people know that we will discount prices we might have created a tendency for people to wait out and then buy at the last minute when prices are lower.\nInterviewer: Exactly. In this industry these cruise companies have an obsession with filling up to capacity instead of thinking about profits! They could make more profits potentially by keeping prices high and having 70% or 80% capacity, but they insist on full capacity. They don’t really make much economic sense. They don’t realize that their variable costs would also be lower at a lower capacity! We have been trying to work with our client to help them understand that profits are more important than capacity.\nCandidate: I see, that’s pretty interesting to know.\nInterviewer: So, in summary, what would you tell the CEO of our client?\nThe candidate should then make a recommendation incorporating the information he/she has gathered from the case. A good candidate will identify viable options for increasing ROIC with an appreciation for the challenges in implementing such changes. The outstanding candidate should also present a clear set of next steps for pursuing those opportunities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "title": "Should ISPs Worry about Customers Watching TV over Internet?",
        "url": "http://www.consultingcase101.com/should-isps-worry-about-customers-watching-tv-over-internet/",
        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: industry analysis.\nConsulting Firm: Gallup Consulting first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: telecommunications, network; information technology (IT)..\nCase Interview Question #00931: Time Warner Cable Internet is an American Internet Service Provider (ISP) that provides broadband Internet service to over 66.9 million people across 29 states, making it the 2nd largest provider of cable broadband Internet in the United States (based on coverage area). Previously known as Road Runner High Speed Online, Time Warner Cable Internet is a division of American telecommunications company Time Warner Cable (NYSE: TWC). The company’s corporate headquarters are located in the Time Warner Center in Midtown Manhattan, New York City.\nRecently, our client, the senior management of Time Warner Cable Internet, has noticed a trend where an increasing number of their customers are watching TV over the Internet. They want to know if this trend is good, bad, or not important, and what they should do about it (if anything). What would you recommend?\nPossible Answer:\nNote to Interviewer: This case requires some understanding of information technology. The case will refer to both  bits-per-second (bps) and bytes-per-second (Bps). You can tell a candidate that there are 8 bits in a byte. 1 Mbps = 1 million bits per second. 1 MBps (capital ‘B’ for byte) is 8 million bits per second. 1 Gb is 1 billion bits, and 1 GB is 1 billion bytes. Note that this is not crucial to the case as a whole, and the interviewer should not allow the candidate to get too fixated on byte and bit conversions.\nPart 1: Gathering Information and Structuring the Problem\nInterviewer: How would you think about evaluating this trend? What information might you need to know? As the candidate asks, the following information can be provided.\nAdditional Information:\n• How many TVs does the average household have? (3)\n• How fast is a typical broadband Internet connection? (1 – 10 Mbps)\n• What is a typical video stream on the Internet? Let’s think…\n• How big is a DVD? (4.5 GB single layer, 9 GB dual layer)\n• How big is a blue-ray disk? (25GB)\n• How many households are there in the US? (About 100 Million)\n• Assume a 2 hour video takes 4GB, even when streamed over the Internet.\nPossible Answers:\nImportant issues to hit:\nThe candidate should have a basic understanding of the Internet video supply chain: content -> distribution -> end customer.\nIt’s crucial to explain why this trend (watching TV over the Internet) is likely a problem for our client: many ISPs also offer cable or satellite services (such as our client Time Warner Cable, Comcast, Verizon, etc.) which will become redundant (and therefore non-revenue generating) if many consumers only purchase a broadband internet connection and watch TV and movies over that connection. Extra points for suggesting that this is analogous to how Vonage and Skype and the mobile phone have made the landline connection less valuable over time.\nExplanation as to why Internet video is gaining popularity and importance: time spent on computer, ability to watch shows whenever the viewer wants to as opposed to a specific weekly schedule, new potential advertising revenue stream.\nInterviewer: If the candidate does not suggest this, prompt them to think about working the numbers to understand if Internet video is a threat (i.e. what is the required bandwidth to watch an Internet video at different levels of quality: standard definition, high definition, blu-ray, etc.)\nCandidate: If a 2 hour video is 4 GB, this gives a streaming rate of 2GB per hour. Dividing 2GB (2GB = 2,000 MB = 2,000,000 KB) by 3,600 seconds in an hour gives 555.6 KBps, which when multiplied by 8 gives 4445 Kbps or 4.4 Mbps. The candidate may estimate these values if they wish.\nInterviewer: Does a typical broadband Internet connection have sufficient bandwidth? (yes, 1 – 10 Mbps)\nWhere is there likely to be a problem?\n• Downstream from the “last mile” house connection, where many houses join.\n• Providing high-quality video at High-Definition and Blu-ray levels.\nLet’s say, if 10 houses share a 100 Mbps connection, is there a problem? (No, because that’s 10 Mbps per house, and it’s unlikely that everybody is watching 3 TVs worth of content simultaneously.)\nPart 2: Digging Deeper into the Industry & Conclusion\nInterviewer: Where does Internet TV content come from?\n• Content Aggregators: Hulu.com, Fancast.com, Netflix\n• Networks websites: abc.com, nbc.com, cbs.com, fox.com\n• Pirate sites\nHow does it get to the provider? (if a value chain has already been discussed this is redundant)\n• Goes through a 3rd party “Internet backbone” company.\nInterviewer: What might we recommend to our ISP client Time Warner Cable?\n• It’s crucial to give the “answer” or recommendation first.\n• Make sure that the candidate restates the key issue: the ISP client Time Warner Cable likely also provides TV through another service offering (cable or satellite) and is going to lose money on that revenue stream.\nPossible Answer:\n• Pricing Bandwidth – if the candidate emphasizes that the ISP client Time Warner Cable should see itself as a pipe that is providing bandwidth to the home then he/she should be sure to suggest that customers pay a premium for increased bandwidth that will allow them to watch Internet video at higher quality levels.\n• Restrict Bandwidth – by restricting bandwidth the ISP Time Warner Cable is able to make sure that the cable or satellite side of the business is able to survive and focus on delivering high quality viewing experience over that platform.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: increase revenue.\nConsulting Firm: Boston Consulting Group (BCG)  first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: airlines; automotive, motor vehicles.\nCase Interview Question #00930: Our client American Airlines, Inc. (AA) is a major U.S. airline headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas. Operating an extensive international and domestic network, American Airlines is the world’s largest airline by fleet size and revenue, and the second largest by number of destinations served, after United Airlines.\nAAdvantage is the frequent flyer program of American Airlines. Launched on May 1, 1981, it was the second such loyalty program in the world (after the first at Texas International Airlines in 1979), and remains the largest with more than 67 million members as of October 2011.\nThe client American Airlines sells frequent flyer miles through partnerships with credit card companies (e.g. CitiBank), hotels, and rental car agencies. While the business overall has been healthy, they have noticed a sharp decline in their frequent flyer miles revenue from the rental car segment: a 50% drop in the last two years. They have asked us to determine the cause for this loss in revenue, and what they can do to reverse the trend. What would you recommend?\nPossible Answer:\nPart 1: Gathering Case Facts\nBehind the scenes: Let the candidate and his/her structure drive the first part of this case interview, but give the following information if he/she asks questions about the followjng topics.\nHistory of AAdvantage frequent flyer program: The AAdvantage frequent flyer program has been in place for over 30 years. It was created for two reasons: (1) competitive advantage, and (2) retention of customers. The client American Airlines was among the very first to have the frequent flyer program, but now almost every airline has frequent flyer miles.\nHow do car rental agencies sell these miles? A car rental agency will advertise that customers can get X frequent flyer miles per car rental day. When customers request the frequent flyer miles, they get the miles and the agency pays the airline for the transaction.\nMore facts about revenue from car rental agencies (only if the candidate asks for it):\n• There are 7 major car rental agencies in the country: Enterprise Rent-A-Car, Hertz Car Rental, Budget Rent A Car, Avis Rent A Car, National Car Rental, Alamo Rent A Car, Thrifty Car Rental/Dollar Rent A Car.\n• 5 out of the 7 agencies are partners with our client American Airlines.\n• These 5 car rental agencies comprise 97% of all car rental business in the US.\n• Number of cars rented has not gone down.\n• Days per rental have not gone down.\n• It is fair to assume that our frequent flyer members would strongly prefer to rent a car that came with miles as compared to a car that did not come with miles.\nKey Insight:\nWhat has decreased is the number of frequent flyer miles sold per day. The next question should be — Why? The rental car companies wanted to lower their own costs per rental transaction by paying less for the frequent flyer miles. They asked the client American Airlines to lower the price per frequent flyer mile, but the airline said it couldn’t do that. In response, the agencies have simply started offering fewer miles per rental.\nPart 2: Possible Solutions to the problem\nInterviewer: Ask the candidate to brainstorm some options.\nPossible Answers:\nMany logical answers are good, but let the candidate go until he/she hits upon this (if not, prompt after awhile): The airline should offer exclusive partnership(s) rather than having everyone as partners. Then explain the value to these car rental agencies of having a lock on this airline’s frequent flyer customers.\nInterviewer: Interesting idea. Why don’t you try figuring out the rental agencies’ willingness to pay (WTP) for the miles under an exclusive partnership agreement. How much could our client AA benefit from such an arrangement? Structure a math problem and provide the following assumptions:\n• 10 MM rentals/year by our frequent flyer members.\n• $45 car rental per day on average.\n• Average rental is 3 days.\n• Approximately 1O% margins on the car rentals for the rental car agencies before paying for any frequent flyer miles.\n• Assume 5 car rental partners now, cut down to 3 partners.\n• Current payments from rental cars to our client AA are $3 per transaction.\nCandidate should note the distinction between fixed and variable costs to the car rental agency and the implications on profit. Marginal profit from extra rentals generated by the program should be calculated based on variable costs, ignoring fixed costs that will be incurred regardless. For simplicity, assume that all costs of the fleet are variable.\nA. Current profit to car rental agencies from our frequent flyer customers:\n(10MM rentals/year) / (5 companies) = 2 MM rentals per company per year\nProfit per transaction is (10% * $45/day * 3 days/rental) – ($3 for frequent flyer payment) = $10.50\nTotal profit (based on variable cost only) to any one agency is 2MM * $10.50 = $21MM. This can also be seen as 10% * $45/day * 3 days/rental * 2MM rentals = $27 MM in incremental profit before paying for frequent flyer miles, minus $6MM in total frequent flyer mile fees.\nB. Potential profit to car rental agencies under 3-partner model:\nAssuming same number of total rentals, each rental agency will now get (10/3) MM customers from the frequent flyer program.\nThe potential profit before paying for frequent flyer miles is: (10%) * ($45/day) * (3 days/rental) * (10/3 MM rentals) = $45 MM.\nSo total theoretical willing to pay (WTP) for the semi-exclusive arrangement, for a single rental agency, is $45 MM – $21 MM $24 MM. Incremental WTP compared to the current arrangement is the incremental profit of $18 MM (or new WTP – current WTP which is $24 MM – $6 MM). Note we can equate WTP to price in this case because the rental agencies are basically setting their own prices.\nC. So total WTP comparison is:\nWTP (new) = $24 MM * 3 = $72 MM\nWTP (old) = $6 MM * 5 = $30 MM (assumes current fee structure equals max WTP)\nKey Insight: This represents up to $42 MM in additional revenue to our client American Airlines. How much of the $42 MM in value can our client capture? But even if we capture, say, half ($21MM), we should have a 70% increase in frequent flyer revenue from car rental agencies.\nPart 3: Other considerations to explore\nBehind the scenes: Throw out a question of what else the airline could think of to increase revenue from this business. This should be a conversational brainstorming session.\nPossible Answers:\nThere are many. Here is a sampling.\n• How to pick car rental agencies to partner with:\n- Do an auction?\n- Base it on geographical coverage?\n- Survey our frequent flyer customers for preference or go with existing market shares among our frequent flyer customers\n• Do customers have loyalty to particular car rental agencies, such that the total number of rentals might shrink under an exclusive partnership agreement?\n• Actual fixed vs. variable cost for the rental car agencies to get a better sense of profit. By assuming all costs are variable we may be under-estimating the profit impact of our program.\n• Do we price the new partnership based on a higher price per mile, or do we mandate that the exclusive partners offer a minimum number of frequent flyer miles per rental day?\n• If it is more profitable to have fewer partners in the rental car space, could we profit from similar exclusive agreements with hotels?\nPart 4. Recommendation\nA good recommendation should sum up the facts and discoveries of the case. There is definitely a possibility to reverse the trend. The recommendation should also take into account the strongest other considerations from the last section, but wrap up firmly and positively.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: add capacity & growth.\nConsulting Firm: Gallup Consulting first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: paper products; manufacturing.\nCase Interview Question #00932: Our client Rockies Paper and Tissue Inc. is a paper manufacturing company specializing in store label tissue paper. Tissue paper or simply tissue is a lightweight paper or, light crepe paper that can be made from recycled paper pulp. This covers toilet paper, paper towels, napkins, and facial tissues. “Store label” means that the tissue paper product made by the client is sold in supermarket or grocery stores and labeled as “made by store”, e.g. “made by Walmart” or “made by Costco”.\nThe client’s key customers are national supermarket and grocery chains, in the Western US. They would like to double their sales in two years, but the store label tissue paper is a slow growing market; it’s been growing at 8%-9% a year, but has hit a plateau recently. They have hired us to see how we can re-accelerate growth and if their goal of doubling sales in two years is attainable. How would you go about it?\nPossible Answer:\nPart 1: Gathering Data\nBehind the scenes: Let the candidate go through the structure and ask for additional information. Give the following data only when asked for.\nAdditional Information:\n• The client company has two manufacturing plants, one near Las Vegas, Nevada, and one in Idaho.\n• Their biggest customers are in the Rockies and in California.\n• The whole market for the tissue paper products is 500M cases per year, all four kinds combined (toilet paper, paper towels, napkins, and facial tissues).\n• 400M cases are branded (i.e., not what the client company makes) and 100M are store label.\n• There are four types of customers for these 100M cases of store label tissue paper.\n– 40 million sold in supermarkets\n– 30 nullion sold in mass market stores (e.g. Walmart)\n– 20 million sold in club stores (e.g. Sam’s Club, Costco)\n– 10 million sold in dollar stores.\n• Their customers (mostly supermarket and grocery chains) make their purchasing decisions regionally, not store by store.\nKey Insights: The client firm is limited right now to the West Coast market because their plants are located there. There’s no reason why these tissue paper products wouldn’t be popular in the East Coast, especially since the same supermarket and grocery chains exist there, too. This could be solved either by opening new plants in the East or by shipping their products to the East Coast.\nPart 2: Costs\nInterviewer: Let’s look at the possibility of shipping to stores on the East Coast — how much it would cost and what kinds of margins we could expect. What would you need to know in order to calculate this?\nBehind the scenes: Let the candidate ask for these, but if time is going by and a variable hasn’t been hit on, give the data.\nAdditional Information:\n• Retailers pay $20 per case of product.\n• It costs $1 to ship a case from either plant to California.\n• It costs $750 to send a truckload of product to Boston, plus 75 cents per mile (the width of the US is 3,000 miles).\n• 1,000 cases can fit in a truck.\nCandidate: He or she should complete the following calculations\n$0.75/mile * 3,000 miles + $750 = $3,000 costs to ship a truckload of product to Boston.\n1,000 * $20 = $20K revenue per truckload\n$20K – $3K = $17K left to cover costs after shipping to Boston.\n1,000 * $1 = $1,000 costs to ship a truckload of product to California.\n$20K – $1K = $19K left to cover costs after shipping to California.\nKey Insight: Shipping is too expensive to the East Coast to consider expanding from the current plants (lower profits on shipping to the East Coast). The client would need to open plants on the East Coast, possibly in less expensive areas.\nPart 3: Product Mix & Marketing\nInterviewer: Now that we’ve looked into shipping and geography, let’s talk about the product mix. Do you think it’s split evenly between the four types (toilet paper, paper towels, napkins, and facial tissues), and if not, what percentages of each do you think are sold?\nPossible Answers:\nFacial tissues have stronger brands (Kleenex being an actual word, for example); paper towels seem almost as strong. Probably stronger sales in napkins and toilet paper, with weaker brand images.\nInterviewer: You’re right. Actually, the client company sells a lot more of the napkins and toilet paper.\nKey Insight: As a tissue paper manufacturer, maybe the client should make more of the better selling products and decrease production of facial tissues and paper towels.\nPart 4: Recommendation\nInterviewer: So, what should we tell the CEO of the client?\nPossible Answers:\nThe answer should refer back to the goals stated in the case opening of doubling size in two years and re-accelerating growth. This can happen only by opening new plants further east to serve markets there without the high shipping costs. Redistributing the product mix is also key.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: private equity & investment.\nConsulting Firm: Gallup Consulting first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: Food & Beverages.\nCase Interview Question #00933: Gallup is working with the client North Castle Partners LLC, a private equity firm based in Greenwich, Connecticut. The client North Castle Partner is thinking of purchasing Naked Juice Company, a fresh fruit juice manufacturer based in Santa Monica, California. The juice company operates on the  West Coast only and serves the high end health food market. Currently servings are in 16 oz bottles. Their fruit juice is sold in high-end delis, cafes such as Starbucks, and large upscale grocery chains such as Whole Foods and Trader Joe’s.\nLast year Naked Juice Company had $90 million in revenues and they have been growing at 15% per year for the past 3 years. They have strong sales and marketing teams and a strong brand name on the West Coast. The private equity client North Castle Partner wants us to identify whether the juice company is an attractive acquisition target. What are some of the things you would look into?\nPossible Answer:\nPart 1: Structuring the problem\nBehind the scenes: First part should be broad. Allow the candidate to brainstorm.\nInterviewer: How would you think about evaluating this investment opportunity?\nPossible Answers:\nImportant issues to hit:\n• Industry dynamics: size, growth, drivers of purchases, trends, competitors’ market share.\n• New entrants, customers.\n• Margins: price, cost structure of the target firm (compare to competitors), possible future changes in the cost structure due to outside forces.\n• Private Equity Fit: Is the acquisition price fair? Is there an exit strategy? How does the potential acquisition fit with the current portfolio, and would there be any synergies?\nPart 2: Digging deeper in industry dynamics\nInterviewer: First, let’s look at the industry dynamics. The high end fruit juice market in the U.S. is $1 Billion. Our client Naked Juice Company is the third largest presence in the industry. The number 1 and 2 players have 70% of the market share. The market overall is growing at 10% annually. What are the one or two most relevant pieces of information you’d like to have about the industry landscape?\nPossible Answers:\n• Are the two top players only operating on the west coast or are they nationwide?\n• How have they been able to capture such a big market share? Is it because they’ve been in the market longer, (our acquisition target looks like a more recently established company given it only operates on the west coast) or because their product is better?\nInterviewer: (give the following information as requested) The two top players operate nationwide. They have been in the market for longer than the acquisition target.\nKey Insight: The target company Naked Juice Co. has been able to be number three even though it is competing with two bigger national players. If the target company goes national, it has the potential to be a big player because it’s been growing faster than the industry (15% vs. 10%). Our target’s growth numbers suggest that its product is comparable to that of the two top players and would be successful in the new markets.\nPart 3: Private Equity Fit\nBehind the scenes: Now come back to the acquisition part of the structure. Guide the conversation to a point where the candidate asks the following question:\nCandidate: Before I dig deeper does the client North Castle Partner have anything in their portfolio that could generate synergies?\nInterviewer: Yes, they own a low end soda and bottle water manufacturer that makes private labels in the United States and Canada. The private labels are sold at retailers like Walmart and Costco.\nKey Insights: (guide the conversation to make sure that the Candidate hits on most of these) Synergies usually come from manufacturing, distribution channels, marketing, etc. In terms of manufacturing, there probably aren’t big synergies because the manufacturing of high-end fruit juices is not similar to sodas (different kinds of ingredients, markets, processes, quality standards).\nThen one might think of trying to sell fruit juice in these channels because there are existing relationships, BUT I think this would hurt the juice company in two ways: First, the placement of a high end juice product in a low end retailer would hurt the brand image. Second, retailers like Walmart will use their buyer power to try and push prices down.\nAlso, the competencies of already-owned sales and marketing teams don’t line up with this business.\nInterviewer: So, what is your overall feeling about this acquisition target’s potential for synergies? (just make sure that there is a clear wrap-up for this section before proceeding to the next)\nCandidate: The target company itself seems promising, but in terms of working with other companies in the client’s portfolio, I see no obvious synergies.\nPart 4: Company Profitability\nInterviewer: Okay, we know Naked Juice Company is a growing company, but now let’s look more closely at profitability. COGS are 75 cents per bottle, manufacturing cost is 20% of revenue, sales and marketing cost is $15M, distribution cost is $30M. Each bottle sells for $2.50. So, what is the juice company’s profit margin?\nCandidate:\nRevenue = $90M\nPrice = $2.50/bottle\nSales Volume = $90M/$2.5 = 36M bottles\nCOGS = 36M * $0.75 = $27M\nManufacturing Cost = $90M * 20% = $18M\nSales/Marketing Cost = $15M\nDistribution Cost = $30M\nProfit = $90M – $27M – $18M – $15M – $30M = 0\nKey Insight: They are not making a profit! We could look at some ways to improve this.\nInterviewer: How would you go about improving the target company’s profitability?\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate: Profit = Revenue – Cost. I’d look at it from two perspectives, increasing revenue and decreasing costs.\nInterviewer: Let’s brainstorm. What are some ways to cut costs?\nCandidate: (as many of these as possible should be hit on)\n• Consolidate suppliers – centralize procurement.\n• Automate the factory – increase manufacturing efficiency.\n• Change packaging to make it lighter without hurting the high end brand image – decreases fuel spending and thus distribution costs.\n• Reducing employees (especially higher ranking ones)\n• Get rid of less profitable juice flavors through profitability analysis and identify the product lines that we could let go. There would also be a potential to use shelf space to sell more of the profitable types.\nInterviewer: Good. Now, what ideas do you have about increasing revenues?\nCandidate: Look at price. We are selling this high end fruit juice at $2.5 a bottle, what’s the competitor’s price? (make sure the candidate asks; otherwise there won’t be grounds upon which to reach a real conclusions)\nInterviewer: Also $2.5 a bottle. Would you consider raising prices?\nPossible Answer:\n(Other answers are acceptable too if backed up by good logic and ideas, but this is probably the best) No, because there are established comparable products with the same price in the market, raising price would be a bad idea. We would either lose market share or potentially spark a price war which would further hurt margins. But we could look at some increased distribution channel penetration. Given the product’s high brand image, we could go into high-end hotels, catering companies, restaurants, etc.\nPart 5. Recommendation\nInterviewer: So, do we tell them that Naked Juice is an attractive acquisition target or not?\nPossible Answer:\nThe key here is to be succinct. But overall, the juice company is an attractive target. Even though the company is currently not making any profits, there are several areas to cut costs and increase revenue and the company is growing faster than the industry.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new business.\nConsulting Firm: A.T. Kearney  first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: consulting, hr, business services.\nCase Interview Question #00935: Your client The MacDowell Agency Inc. is a background check company specializing in background investigation and pre-employment screening services. Pre-employment screening refers to the process of investigating the backgrounds of potential employees and is commonly used to verify the accuracy of a job applicant’s claims as well as to discover any possible criminal history, workers compensation claims, or employer sanctions. For example, CBC News of Canada reported that fraud in the workplace cost Canadian Businesses over $3.2 Billion in 2011.\nUsually the client The MacDowell Agency is hired by other companies to perform background checks on their new hires before a formal job offer is made. They have a particular emphasis on the transportation industry, especially with trucking companies, where they are the clear market leader and profitable. The CEO of The MacDowell Agency doesn’t believe his company has reached its full potential. They have retained A.T. Kearney to determine if they should branch out and enter a new market. What would you recommend to the CEO?\nPossible Answer:\n1. Suggested Structure\nA customization of the 3C’s framework (Company, Customer, Competitors) should work pretty well.\na. Core Competencies of Company\n• Trained Personnel\n• Strong Brand\n• Access to Databases\n• Scale\nb. Potential Markets\n• Market Size\n• Growth\n• Segmentation\n• Competition\nc. Identify Best Market, then Discuss Implementation & Risks\n2. Probing for Additional Information\nCore Competencies of the client company:\n• They have well-trained personnel.\n• They are reputable in trucking industry, but not well known outside trucking.\n• They maintain the key database on background checks for the trucking industry. Their competitors pay them to access their database.\n• Their services can have high barrier to entry\n– Standard employment/education check –> very common and easy\n– Driving record check with DMV (Department of Motor Vehicles) –> very common and easy\n– Criminal Record check by checking with over 2,000 state and local court records –> difficult and costly. The company needs to have a number of runners that check the records.\nKey Insights:\n• The client won’t face normal barrier to entry since they already check criminal records.\n• Their reputation in transportation industry could provide a strong value proposition in a new market.\n3. Revenue & Cost Calculations (no numbers, just setting up the equations)\nInterviewer: Could you set up a formula to determine the client’s annual revenue that involves only data we can find in A.T. Kearney’s databases?\nCandidate:\nRevenue = 70% * Market Size of Transportation Industry\n= 70% * (Price) * (# of background checks requested per year)\n= 70% * (Price) * (# of new hire/year) / (Check Pass Rate)\n= 70% * (Price) * (# of Truckers) / ((Check Pass Rate) * (Trucker turnover rate))\nInterviewer: What do you think are the most important drivers of the client’s cost?\nCandidate:\n• Labor\n– Runners checking records\n– Staff compiling records\n• SG&A (selling, general & administrative expense)\nNote: The candidate should point out that costs remain mostly fixed because they already have runners going to most courthouses and it is easy for a runner to check 5 names versus 3. The interviewer should probe/hint the candidate in this direction until he/she gets it.\n4. Potential New Markets\nMarkets ordered by size: largest to smallest\n1. Transportation\na. Twice as big as #2 Retail, the client currently has 70% market share.\n2. Retail\na. Basic background checks for employees – including employment and criminal record.\nb. Low barriers to entry, highly fragmented market.\n3. Health Care\na. Not that much smaller than retail.\nb. In-depth background checks required.\nc. No data available on fragmentation of market and whether there is a “trusted name” in the market.\nKey Insights:\n• Retail market is attractive because we can do background checks and have a strong brand name.\n• Health care contracts are intensive, so there might be differences in profit margins of companies.\n• There is still large untapped potential in transportation industry.\n5. Recommendation\nSomething that is logical and supported by facts should work. You don’t have perfect info here, so just make up your mind and run with it.\nSample Recommendation:\n“Mr. CEO we advise you to expand into the retail background checking. Specifically, we believe that your reputation in transportation industry and existing capability to check criminal records would give you a competitive advantage, specifically since retail space is very fragmented. We propose that you have a small fraction of your sales force to acquiring background check contracts for retailers. With that experience you can branch out and grow your company.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The company produces food, beverage, and household and body care products. Sara Lee is also the brand name of a number of frozen and packaged foods.\nThe client Sara Lee sells their consumer packaged goods mostly in grocery and convenience stores. They have a team of 500 salespeople who personally visit the stores 2-6 times a year and are responsible for tracking and restocking the inventory, monitoring the expiration dates of the product, and for selling to the stores. The sales force visits 125,000 stores per year in the United States. The client Sara Lee wants to increase its operating efficiency by raising the number of sales force to stores visits by 10% and increase sales by 20%. How would you go about helping the client to achieve these two goals?\nPossible Answer:\nPart 1: Focus on the number of store visits\nInterviewer: What are some ways that we can look to increase the number of visits per year?\nCandidate: Expand geographically and increase the number of stores, prioritize which stores to visit more.\nInterviewer: The sales force works 40 hour per week and is at capacity with regards to number of store visits. Given these constraints, how can we implement your suggestions? What factors should we explore further?\nCandidate: The interviewee should ask for a salesperson’s tasks and schedule, which is given below\n• 25% of time spent stocking; monitoring expiration dates and counting inventory\n• 25% of time spent selling\n• 25% of time spent on administrative tasks, i.e. paperwork\n• 25% of time spent driving\nInterviewer: What are some ways that we can make this process more efficient?\nCandidate:\n• Automate processes by reducing paperwork;\n• scan the products instead of manually checking and writing on paper;\n• work on driver’s routes to make trips more efficient.\nInterviewer:\n• By scanning products, we can reduce the stocking time by 50%.\n• By adding GPS systems to the cars we can save 25% in driving times.\n• By going paperless and eliminating forms we can reduce administrative time by 20%.\n• Finally, all these changes will also result in increased efficiency in selling by 20%.\nWhat overall efficiency savings does this translate to?\nCandidate:\n\n\n\nTask\nCurrent Time\nEfficiency Reduction\nImproved Time\n\n\nStocking\n10 hours\n50%\n5 hours\n\n\nSelling\n10 hours\n20%\n8 hours\n\n\nDriving\n10 hours\n25%\n7.5 hours\n\n\nAdministrative\n10 hours\n20%\n8 hours\n\n\n\nThis gives us a total of 5 + 8 + 7.5 + 8 = 28.5 hours under the improved system.\n40 – 28.5 = 11.5 hours which is approximately 30% increased efficiency.\nKey Insight: These changes have potential for substantial efficiency improvements, including saving enough time to increase the number of visits by at least 10%.\nInterviewer: What are some potential challenges associated with increasing visits?\nCandidate:\nBefore committing to more visits, investigate if there even is an opportunity to visit a larger number of stores. Longer drive times to get to new stores may counteract efficiency improvements. The sales force may also be resistant to changing their routines.\nPart 2: Sales improvements\nInterviewer: What are some factors you would want to look at in analyzing the potential for increasing sales?\nCandidate:\n• The success rate of multiple visits – what increase do we see in sales based on number of visits.\n• Sales data based on store size – are we more successful in larger or smaller stores.\nInterviewer: This chart below shows the rate of sales per visit to different store sizes.\n\n\n\nStore Size\n2 visits\n4 visits\n6 visits\n\n\nSmall 25% of stores\n1,000\n1,000\n1,000\n\n\nMedium 50% of stores\n6,000\n8,000\n10,000\n\n\nLarge 25% of stores\n12,000\n15,000\n18,000\n\n\n\nWhat does this tell you? Where should we focus our efforts?\nCandidate: We are not getting extra value from additional visits in the small stores. We should focus our efforts on targeting multiple visits to as many large stores as possible.\nInterviewer: What are some challenges associated with focusing on only the larger stores?\nCandidate: Larger stores are going to service larger areas, so they will be more spread out geographically. This will add to the drive time. They may be chains, and therefore if one refuses to sell more of the product, perhaps all of them will, because they are dictated by a corporate purchaser.\nPart 3: Recommendations\nAsk the interviewee to round up the points that have been covered and present a final recommendation. This is a more open-ended and qualitative case, so the recommendation will depend on the points that were raised during the discussion. Good answers should be well-organized and confidently delivered with logic to back up the assumptions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: estimate, guesstimate.\nConsulting Firm: Gallup Consulting first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: software, information technology (IT); online business.\nCase Interview Question #00936: Monster.com is one of the most visited employment websites in the United States and one of the largest in the world. The website is owned and operated by Weston, Massachusetts based Monster Worldwide Inc. (NYSE: MWW). Monster.com is primarily used to help those seeking work to find job openings, for lower to mid-level employment, that match their skills and location.\nLet’s say you’re the Senior Vice-President of Strategy for Monster.com. At the end of 2005, the US economy is very good and you were paid handsomely for the year. The Monster.com website has 3 main business lines in the U.S. contributing a total of USD $600 million in revenue (2005):\n(1) Jobs posting business (60%) – list price is $395 per posting but with discounting is sold at $60.\n(2) Resume database business (30%) – sold for $2,000 per user per year (e.g. HR staffer, recruiter) for access to ~50 million resumes of job seekers.\n(3) Online pop-up ad business (10%) – e.g. University of Phoenix ad.\nNow fast forward to year 2009. The CEO of Monster.com has asked you to forecast the U.S. revenues for this year. How would you go about estimating Monster’s 2009 U.S. revenue?\nPossible Answer:\n1. Suggested Structure\nA minimum structure should include at least macro-economy (trends, population, unemployment), Monster business (competitive share gains, emerging products, declining businesses) and could also include risks (emerging competitors or job hiring models). The biggest challenge in this case is determining what data is important versus irrelevant.\nThere are no emerging products or competitive gains to consider in this case. The interviewer should guide the candidate towards analyzing the trend with revenues from job posting. (Since it is not clear that this is the focus of the problem, the interviewer needs to be a bit more proactive in helping out).\n2. Analysis\nInterviewer: Let’s focus on the job posting business first. What are the underlying drivers of the job posting business?\nCandidate: Immediate drivers are US population and unemployment rate.\nNote: A stronger candidate will get to turnover of jobs quickly but leave the candidates to get to this on their own eventually, asking directional questions. For example, ask them what has to happen for a job to get posted on the Internet (Answer: employee must leave current position to create a job vacancy). Employees are more likely to leave when the economy is good, job market is booming and jobs are freely available.\nInterviewer: How do we get relevant information for this case study?\nCandidate: Sources include U.S. Labor Department, Bureau of Labor Statistics, online research, Wall Street economic forecasts, market research firm, etc.\nInterviewer: Say we have some data available. What would you like to know to estimate revenues in 2009?\nCandidate: The candidate must ask for working people, the turnover rate, the trend in turnover, etc.\nAdditional Information:\nIn 2005 there were 180 million people working in the U.S. and job turnover rate was 20%.\nThere are also 180 million people working in 2009.\nTurnover trends:\n1999: 20%\n2001: 10%\n2002: 10%\n2005: 20%\nCandidate:\nA strong candidate will comment on the relation between the turnover trend and the macro-economy (recession, growth and relation to job trends).\nFor example, the trend looks interesting. The economy was strong in 1999, so turnover rate was high. It worsened with 9/11 attacks and the burst of dot-com tech bubble. So turnover went down as people feared leaving their jobs. As the economy recovered in 2005 turnover went back up. In 2009, unemployment is high and therefore turnover should be back down.\nInterviewer: That seems logical, in fact, we regressed the data on turnover versus unemployment rate and saw that R^2 was 0.92. Unemployment rate was 7% in 2001 and 3.5% in 2005 and 7% again in 2009. What do you think turnover would be in 2009?\nCandidate: Well, with an R^2 of 0.92, then I’d estimate 2009 turnover would be 10% because unemployment is 7% (similar to 2001).\nInterviewer: OK, using that data what is the revenue?\nCandidate: If the turnover rate has halved and workers remained constant, then assuming constant pricing (ignoring inflation for now), 2009 revenue would also be half of that in 2005.\nJob posting revenue in 2005 = 60% * $600M = $360M (under a turnover of 20%)\nIn 2009, since turnover = 10%, Job posting revenue = 0.5 * $360M = $180 Million\nInterviewer: Ok, now the resume database. What are some ways we could sell it differently?\nCandidate: Subscription model, discounted with job postings, corporate relationships, target experienced hires, universities, etc.\nInterviewer: Let’s say we expect to sell 60,000 user seats in 2009, what would you estimate revenues to be?\nCandidate: Resume database revenue = 60,000 * $2,000 = $120 million, or $60 million less than they were doing in 2005.\nInterviewer: What about the online ad business? What drives its profitability and how do you expect 2009 is different than 2005?\nCandidate: Primarily how much Monster.com charges advertisers per click. I’d estimate that because there are more job sites today (e.g. Indeed.com, Careerbuilder.com, Dice.com) than in 2005, price that monster can charge has probably gone down while visitors have increased because there are more online users.\nInterviewer: Right, if advertiser’s cost per 1,000 clicks is down 25% and the number of visitors has doubled, what will ad revenue be?\nCandidate: Ad revenue = $60M * (1-25%) * 2 = $90M\nInterviewer: So what will 2009 revenue be?\nCandidate: 2009 total revenue = $180M + $120M + $90M = $390M.\nInterviewer: How is the 2009 revenue number compared to 2005 number?\nCandidate: $390M / $600M = 65%, 2009 revenue is down 35% from 2005!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: private equity & investment.\nConsulting Firm: A.T. Kearney final round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: electronics, semiconductors.\nCase Interview Question #00937: High-definition television (HDTV) provides a resolution that is substantially higher than that of standard-definition television. HDTV technology was introduced in the United States in the late 1980s and made official in 1993 by the Digital HDTV Grand Alliance, a group of television, electronic equipment, communications companies. The first public HDTV broadcast in the United States occurred in July, 1996.\nYour client Silver Lake Partners is an American private equity firm focused on leveraged buyout and growth capital investments in technology, technology-enabled and related industries. Founded in 1999, the PE firm is one of the largest technology investors in the world.\nThe year is 2005. The client Silver Lake Partners is looking to purchase General Instrument Inc., an HDTV remote control manufacturing company. The PE firm would like to sell the company after 3 years. Should they go forward with the acquisition? Why or why not?\nPossible Answer:\n1. Suggested Structure\nThe candidate should take some time to come up with a simple, logical, MECE (mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive) structure that includes a bucket for the following:\n• Market (Market Size, Growth, Competition, etc.)\n• Target Company (Revenues, Costs, Market Share, Product, etc.)\n• The client/PE Firm (Strategy, Cannibalization, Synergies, Risks，ROI, etc.)\nCandidate should first look to analyze the market’s attractiveness by starting to look at market size and growth. They can assume that the only real competition is 2 main players, but otherwise the HDTV remote control market is fragmented.\n2. Market Sizing\nInterviewer: A good candidate should first attempt to size the market as follows, but if not, guide him/her to do so.\nKey Insight: Candidate should recognize that TV remotes are innately tied to the TVs they control, and should therefore look to size the market via the number of households in the U.S.\nMarket sizing of TV’s:\n• 300M people in the US\n• 3 people / household\n• 100M households\n• on average 3 TV’s / household\n• 300M TV’s\nThe candidate might assume that the useful life of a normal TV is 10 years, and will therefore want to divide the 300M TV’s by 10 to get a total of 30M TV’s sold per year. However, they should think about a potential consumer’s buying process when it comes to upgrading to an HDTV. Most people don’t switch to HDTV because their old TV is broken, but rather, they switch to HDTV because it’s the latest and greatest in technology.\n3. Target Company\nThe interviewer should then guide the candidate to focus on the Target Company. When prompted, the interviewer can provide the following information:\nAdditional Information:\n• Revenues for the last 3 years have been $25M (2002), $50M (2003), and $100M (2004).\n• They’ve maintained a 25% market share throughout.\n• HDTV remotes sell at $10 each.\n• You can assume margins are attractive.\n• If they haven’t figured this out already, the candidate should recognize that TV remotes are tied to the TV’s they control.\nCandidate should infer that the HDTV remotes market has been growing from $100M to $200M to $400M (2004), or 100% growth year over year for the last 3 years. At $10 per remote, the number of HDTV remotes has been growing from 10M (2002) to 20M (2003) to 40M (2004).\nNote: Candidate should now look at the growth rate for the next 3 years, and the 3 years after that.\n4. Market Growth\nInterviewer: How would you expect the market to behave over this time frame (the next 6 years)?\nCandidate: Let’s assume that all the normal TV’s will be replaced gradually based on momentum. A few people will try HDTV’s at first. Then once momentum builds and HDTV’s become very popular, demand will pick up such that most of the purchasing comes in the first few years and then evens out towards the end.\nInterviewer: Tell the candidate that the client expects that all normal TV’s will be replaced by HDTV’s and that from start to finish this process will take 9 years.\nBehind the Scenes: Looking at the data we have on the market growth of HDTV Remotes.\n\n\n\nYear\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n\n\n# of HDTV Remotes sold\n10M\n20M\n40M\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCumulative\n10M\n30M\n70M\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo fill the rest of the table out, we know that total # of TV’s in the U.S. = 300M\nAssume that the average # of TV’s sold/year in remaining years = 40M\nHowever, we know most of this will be front-loaded.\nAsk the candidate to draw a chart of what he/she expects the market penetration of HDTV remotes to look like. It should look something like this:\n\n5. Recommendation\nInterviewer: Before asking for the final recommendation, share the following table with the candidate. Ask the candidate to assess whether or not the client Silver Lake Partners should acquire the target company and why. If necessary, the interviewer should guide the candidate to think about what drives the purchase price.\n\n\n\nYear\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005E\n2006E\n2007E\n2008E\n2009E\n2010E\n\n\n# of HDTV Remotes sold\n10M\n20M\n40M\n60M\n60M\n50M\n30M\n20M\n10M\n\n\nCumulative\n10M\n30M\n70M\n130M\n190M\n240M\n270M\n290M\n300M\n\n\n\nNote: A good candidate will recognize the following sequence of events and what they mean in terms of the target company’s value.\n2002 – 2004: High Growth = High Multiples\n2005: Proposed Acquisition Date\n2005 – 2007: Sustained Growth = High Multiples\n2008: Proposed Sell Date\n2008 – 2010: Decline = Low Multiples\nInterviewer: So what can you surmise about what we would have to pay for the target company now and what we could sell it for later?\nConclusion:\nFrom this analysis, the candidate can conclude that this is a bad deal despite the growing market and profitability of the target company, because of the high multiples they would have to pay to acquire the company (in 2005), and then the low multiples they would command 3 years later when they sell the company (in 2008).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "title": "Novartis to Boost Sales of New Hypertension Drug",
        "url": "http://www.consultingcase101.com/novartis-to-boost-sales-of-new-hypertension-drug/",
        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new product; increase sales.\nConsulting Firm: Gallup Consulting first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: healthcare: pharmaceutical, biotech, life sciences..\nCase Interview Question #00938: Our client Novartis International AG (SIX: NOVN, NYSE: NVS) is a multinational pharmaceutical company based in Basel, Switzerland, ranking number one in sales (57.9 billion US$) among the world-wide industry in 2013. The businesses of Novartis are divided into three operating divisions: Pharmaceuticals, Alcon (eye care) and Sandoz (generics). Novartis operates directly and through dozens of subsidiaries in countries around the world.\nNovartis USA has just released a new hypertension drug called Aliskiren (trade names Tekturna in the US) 18 months ago. It is the first in a class of drugs called direct Renin inhibitors used for high blood pressure. However, Novartis has been underwhelmed with poor sales. They have hired Gallup to figure out why the sales of Aliskiren have been so dismal, and also, what can be done to increase sales. How would you go about it?\nPossible Answer:\n1. Competitive Landscape and Product Differentiation \nWhen prompted for information, the interviewer can reveal the following.\nAdditional Information:\n• The drug Aliskiren treats high blood pressure.\n• There are many kinds of drugs that treat hypertension in the market, and they’re grouped into 5 classes according to how they work.\n• Our new drug Aliskiren is in a new class: class six (Renin Inhibitors).\n• Our new drug retails for $120 a month, after insurance covers a portion of it, patients need to pay $25 a month out of pocket.\n• All other classes but 1 have gone generic, and retail at $4 a month after insurance covers the other portion.\n• The other drug class that isn’t generic yet is a class called Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs), it retails also at $120 a month with similar insurance breakdown. However, 1/2 of the ARB drugs will have patents expire the next year; so generic versions will come out very soon thereafter. The other 1/2 of ARB drugs will meet a similar fate in 2 years. Ultimately, the only other drug that is sold in non-generic form will be gone in 2 years.\n• Our new drug is safe with no reactions to other drugs or side effects. It sets blood pressure down about 14 MMGH, the range for all drugs is 14-17, and the ARB drugs lower blood pressure to around 14-16. So, our new drug is on the low end, and doctors prefer drugs to lower pressure as much as possible, although hypotension (low blood pressure) can be a big concern.\n• The only differentiator between our new drug and the ARB drugs is that our drug stays in the system longer. With hypertension medication, if you miss a dose (once a day), your blood pressure spikes up even more than before you started taking the drug, which is very unsafe. With our drug, you can miss a dose and everything will be fine.\n2. Stakeholder Relations\nWhen prompted, the interviewer can reveal the following:\n• The drug company Novartis has good relations with most insurance carriers and the new drug Aliskiren has already gotten onto most formularies, and should be easily accessible. Contacting the insurance companies has been exhausted, and there is marketing saturation with the company’s means of being able to reach out to other insurance companies. Ultimately, pushing to more insurance companies is not an option.\n• Patients don’t know much about blood pressure drugs, and don’t really care what they get.\n• Doctors are aware of our new drug, but think it’s very expensive, don’t believe it’s on formularies, and aren’t sure when and to whom to prescribe it.\n3. Marketing Ideas\nMarketing more to insurance companies is a dead end, as they’re saturated already. Marketing efforts should be focused first on doctors (care providers), and then on patients.\nSome possible things to bring up for doctors:\n• High-touch sales efforts – office visits to get awareness out.\n• Materials to bring awareness of the new drug, its benefits, and also its insurance formulary availability to light.\n• Guidelines on when and to whom to prescribe.\nSome possible ideas for patients:\n• Ads or commercials bringing out the fact that the new hypertension drug is more forgiving on missing a dose.\n• There should be adequate messaging so that patients don’t feel encouraged to act recklessly on moral hazard.\n• Try to hammer on the fact that patients should be motivated through the big value proposition of accidentally missing a dose with no ill consequence to ask for this new drug from their doctors.\n4. Recommendation\nThe candidate should bring to the fore that the problem in the new drug’s poor revenue growth has come as a result of the stakeholders in charge of prescribing and purchasing the drug not having enough information about it. The candidate should focus on the fact that making doctors aware of the drug’s insurance connections and increasing education of physicians will have the most drastic impact on sales.\nAlso, with the right ads and commercials, it’s possible that this could become the first “celebrity” or “blockbuster” high blood pressure drug, and further pull demand with patients requesting the drug from their doctors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: improve profitability; math problem.\nConsulting Firm: McKinsey & Company first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: cosmetics, beauty products.\nCase Interview Question #00924: The client SuperValu, Inc. is a large national retailer. The corporation, headquartered in the Minneapolis suburb of Eden Prairie, Minnesota, has been in business for nearly a century. It is the fifth largest supermarket chain in the United States (after Kroger and Albertsons). In addition to grocery, food and drinks, SuperValu also sells consumer products and household goods in their stores.\nRecently, the client SuperValu has asked you to look into their deodorant category, which had sales of $500 million last year. The deodorant category has been profitable but the client has recently learned that their deodorant category’s profitability is below the industry average. Specifically, the client SuperValu wants to know:\n(1) Why is the client’s profitability of the deodorant category lower than the industry average?\n(2) If possible, how can the client increase this category’s profitability?\nPossible Answer:\n1. Note to the interviewer\nThe trick to this profitability case is that the client has the same profitability per deodorant brand it sells compared to the competition, but the client gets majority of its sales from the least profitable brand (Axe). The client also does not have a Private Label deodorant, however the Private Label typically has a high profitability. Everything else in the discussion with the candidate can be made up but it needs to be aligned with the insights below. For example, the competitors are growing deodorant sales at 5%/year just like the client does.\nIf the candidate asks if the client wants to match the profitability of the other competitors, answer that we do not know the profitability of each competitor.\nIf the candidate asks if the client wants to match the average profitability of the deodorant category that the rest of the market has (this can be calculated from the Exhibits), answer that the client is most interested in growing the profits fast instead of matching some targeted profitability.\n2. Case Opening\nAfter the candidate structures the case, ask some probing questions as appropriate. Look for connection to the Hypothesis he/she stated.\nPart 1: ask the candidate to study the data in Exhibit 1 and share what he/she observed.\nExhibit 1, Vendor sales mix – % of revenues\n\n\n\n\nAxe\nDegree\nOld Spice\nGillette\nRight Guard\nPrivate Label\n\n\nClient’s Stores\n55%\n10%\n17%\n10%\n8%\n0%\n\n\nRest of Market\n35%\n20%\n25%\n10%\n3%\n7%\n\n\n\nInsight 1: the majority (55%) of the client’s sales in this category comes from a single brand (Axe).\nInsight 2: the client does not have a Private Label deodorant as the competitors have.\nInsight 3: apart from these two, often the client has a different percentage of sales (often substantially different in relative terms, e.g., Degree, Right Guard) coming from the rest of the brands compared to the rest of the market.\nThis should lead the candidate into asking for profit margins for each brand which is essentially Exhibit 2.\nPart 2: ask the candidate to study the data in Exhibit 2 and share what he/she observed.\nExhibit 2, EBIT as a percentage of sales\n\n\n\n\nPrivate Label\nDegree\nOld Spice\nGillette\nRight Guard\nAxe\n\n\nClient’s Stores and Rest of Market\n35%\n40%\n16%\n27%\n38%\n15%\n\n\n\nInsight 4: Axe brand has the lowest profitability (15%) while it represents 55% of the client’s sales. This is not good for maximizing profit from the deodorant category.\nInsight 5: the key to the client’s problem is the sales distribution between different brands. The client should decrease the sales of the less profitable brands and increase sales of the more profitable brands.\nInsight 6: two brands that the client has a lower percent of sales when compared to the rest of the market are Degree and Private Label; however, these are the two brands that have very high to highest profit margins.\nNote: Private Label would be the client’s own label which the client would need to start selling after some homework on how to make/source it and introduce it to the market. This could be a good point of discussion with the candidate.\nAsk the candidate: How to start selling its own Private Label deodorant? What needs to happen? For example: find a manufacturer that wants to supply deodorant to the client for the Private Label sales, hopefully find a manufacturers that is already making popular smells for other brands (since often there are a few manufacturers that make most of the deodorants and other brand names simply source the material from them), make the new product introduction plan, where to do it first since the client is a large national retailer, promotions, shelf space and positioning, etc.\nInsight 7: Right Guard also has a high profit margin but the client already has a higher percentage of Right Guard than the rest of the market so the client should likely not focus on this brand as it might be hard to increase its percentage of sales further. Better focus on the low hanging fruit. However, increasing sales of Right Guard could be an interesting point of discussion with the client.\nInsight 8: the other two brands (Old Spice and Gillette) also have lower margins so it is better not to focus on them at this point, especially not the Old Spice.\n\n\n\n\nAverage weighted profit margin\n\n\nClient’s Stores\n55%*15% + 10%*40% + 17%*16% + 10%*27% + 8%*38% = 20.71%\n\n\nRest of Market\n35%*15% + 20%*40% + 25%*16% + 10%*27% + 3%*38% + 7%*35% = 23.54%\n\n\n\nInsight 9: Just as FYI, the average weighted profit margin for the deodorant category for the Rest of Market is about 24%. The Client’s average weighted profit margin, that is, average profit margin for the whole Deodorant category is about 21%. This is not expected to be calculated by the candidate and it does not provide additional valuable insight than what was obvious from the qualitative assessment of the same (see Insight 5). The candidate should recognize that this somewhat complex calculation would burn his/her valuable time but would not change the direction of the case analysis.\nPart 3: if the candidate did not select to calculate an increase in profitability for some scenario in Exhibit 2, ask him/her to pick one and do it.\nOne way to set up the analysis for this case after studying the two Exhibits could be: Impact of shifting product mix from Axe products to Degree and Private Label.\nLet’s say the client shifts 15% of sales from Axe to Degree (10%) and Private Label (5%).\nImpact to shift from Axe to Degree: $500M * (40% – 15%) * 10% = $12.5M\nImpact to shift from Axe to Private Label: $500M * (35% – 15%) * 5% = $5M\nTotal Impact in profit increase: $12.5M + $5M = $17.5M\nIf the candidate also calculates the profit for last year (i.e., $103.5M), then this would roughly represent a 17% increase in profitability.\nProfit for last year = $500M * (55%*15% + 10%*40% + 17%*16% + 10%*27% + 8%*38%) = $103.55M\n$17.5M / $103.55M = ~17%\nAsk the candidate: is $17.5M (or whatever else the candidate calculates) a minor, medium or major profitability increase in this category? Ask the candidate how else to determine this if he/she gets stuck in calculating current profitability for the client and the rest of the market (see Insight 9).\nAsk the candidate: How to achieve increase sales of Degree and Private Label (or whatever else the candidate selected as the optimal approach)? For example: promotions, positioning on the shelf space, advertisement, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Cost calculations\nTotal Costs = £329,144/year\na. £294,200 Fixed Costs\nMortgage: £14,400 per month, £14,400 * 12 = £172,800 per year\nCouncil License: £25,000 per year\nBusiness Rates: £6,250 per month, £6,250 *12 = £75,000 per year\nUtilities: £21,400 per year\nSub-total: £172,800 + £25,000 + £75,000 + £21,400 = £294,200\nb. £34,944 Variable Costs\nStaff: £3 per person * 96 people per week = £288 per week\n£288 * 52 weeks = £14,976 per year\nCleaning: £4 per person * 96 people per week (£2 for Maid Services + £2 for Laundry) = £384 per week\n£384 * 52 weeks = £19,968 per year\nYou can segment these further:\nMaid Services: Labor £1.50 + Cleaning Products £0.50\nLaundry: Bed Linen £1.00 + Towels £1.00\n3. Scope for revenue increase\nCandidate: There might be a way to increase existing revenue by looking at Sunday’s occupancy and price structure. At present Sunday generates £480 per week at a rate of 50% occupancy.\nDo we have projections for revenue change if we look at reducing the price charged on Sunday in a bid to increase occupancy levels and overall revenue?\nInterviewer: We project the following:\n- £15 per night (current price), 50% occupancy (32 guests) = £480 per week\n- £12 per night, 70% occupancy (45 guests) = £540 per week\n- £10 per night, 80% occupancy (51 guests) = £510 per week\nTherefore, if we changed the price from the current £15 per night to £12 per night, we would see Sunday revenues increase by (£540-£480) * 52 weeks = £3,120 per year.\n4. Scope for revenue diversification\nCandidate: Do we offer car parking facilities?\nInterviewer: There are 12 car parking spaces outside the hotel. All are used all of the time due to high occupancy rates. At present no rate is charged for guests to use them.\nCandidate: Do we have projections for the profit this could generate?\nInterviewer: Yes. We think we could charge £5 per car per day.\nCandidate: £5 per car per day * 12 spaces * 7 days * 52 weeks = £21,840 per year\nCandidate: I remember that you said there was an empty reception room downstairs, of good size. At present do we use this to serve breakfast?\nInterviewer: At present we do not offer a breakfast service, no.\nCandidate: Do we have projections for the profit this could generate?\nInterviewer: Yes. We think we could charge £5 per breakfast; costs would be £4 per breakfast.\nCandidate: Do we have projections for the number of guests who would use this breakfast service?\nInterviewer: We project that 70% of our weekly guests would choose to use this service.\nCandidate:\n£1 profit * 70% of 96 guests = £1 profit * 67 guests = £67 per week\n£67 * 52 weeks = £3,484 per year\nNote 1: If the candidate identifies the potential to increase Sunday occupancy, recalculate the number of breakfast consumers accordingly, which will see an annual increase in breakfast revenue of £468 p.a. (13 more guests on Sunday, 70% of which is equal to 9 breakfast consumers, equaling £9 extra profit per week * 52 weeks). This would increase the overall breakfast profit figure to £3,952 per year.\nNote 2: This breakfast model could be rolled out to lunchtimes and dinnertimes, too, to see increased revenue streams – and thus overall increased revenue.\n5. Scope for costs savings\nWith the exception of the mortgage, which may be changed to a variable rate product (albeit with inherent risks involved) at a saving of 1% per month in the first year (£144 per month / £1,728 per year), no other costs (fixed or variable) can be reduced.\nAs we are a budget hotel, it may be reasonable to ask guests when booking that they bring their own towels. If not, they may hire a towel at a cost of £1 per night (equivalent to the towels’ laundry cost). This would abolish one of our costs and would generate cost savings of £4,992 (thus, immediately breaking even).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

(NYSE: PG) is an American consumer products conglomerate headquartered in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio, United States. Its main products include cleaning agents, and personal care products. The company structure has been categorized into four sectors: Beauty Care; Baby, Feminine, and Family Care; Fabric and Home Care; Health and Grooming.\nOld Spice Inc. is a subsidiary of Procter & Gamble. The company’s main product line is deodorant and anti-perspirant sprays, roll-ons and sticks. Sales over the last five years have been steadily growing in North America, and now the Old Spice team is ready to take its products global. As the team’s leader, how would you assess whether or not international expansion is a good idea? If so, which country or countries offer the greatest three-year revenue opportunity? Estimate the greatest three-year revenue opportunity.\nPossible Answer:\nThe candidate should first determine a structure for their approach. Then, asking probing questions to get as much information as possible.\n1. Additional Information: (to be provided to the candidate if asked)\n• Location preferences: None. The Old Spice management wants the project team to tell them.\n• Product line: Any or all of the three deodorant types can be launched into new locations. Each product (stick, spray, roll-on) lasts 3 months long on average.\n• Team: Internal resources appear sufficient to handle this launch. Candidate is the team leader.\n• Capital, production and distribution: Parent company Procter & Gamble will support any well defined need. Worldwide production and distribution facilities will help. Relationships with retailers are good.\n• Financial targets: 25% annual revenue growth for 3 years and year one sales of at least $50M.\n• North American sales: Last year’s sales were $350M. North American growth is about 10% per year.\n• Suppliers: Non-issue, North American suppliers.\n• Government/Legislation: No barriers.\n• Financing this venture: Non-issue.\n2. Insight Checkpoint (Redirect the discussion to these areas if necessary)\n• In terms of market potential, Brazil, Germany and Japan are the largest.\n• Each country is about equal in terms of deodorant usage rates.\n• Prices do vary by country but in general the price points by product type do not vary much.\n• Spray tends to be the highest and stick is the cheapest.\n• Certain markets are more crowded than others: France, Spain and Germany. The UK, Brazil and Japan have significant fragmentation with many small competitors.\n• No one type of deodorant is dominant in terms of usage.\n3. Exhibits\nAt this point, the interviewer should tell the candidate that they are going to show them 4 handouts (Exhibit 1-4). After each handout, ask the Candidate for the key observations from each slide.\nExhibit 1. Population and deodorant usage\n\nExhibit 2. Average price paid per 2 oz.\n\nExhibit 3. Key Competitors by Market\n\nExhibit 4. Deodorant User Preferences\n\n4. Market Sizing\nThe interviewer should then guide the Candidate to estimate the total market size, or annual revenue, of selling into the three largest countries (Brazil, Japan, and Germany).\n\n\n\nBrazil\nJapan\nGermany\n\n\nTotal market\n~84M customers\n~90M customers\n~60M customers\n\n\nAverage price\n$2 (weight toward spray)\n$3 (weight toward spary)\n$2 (even weighting)\n\n\nUsage ratio (no info)\n4x (1 per quarter year)\n4x (1 per quarter year)\n4x (1 per quarter year)\n\n\nEstimated market share\n10% (0.25 of fragmented 40%)\n10% (0.2 of fragmented 50%)\n5% (not fragmented)\n\n\nAnnual estimated revenue\n84M * $2 * 4 * 0.1 = $67M\n90M * $3 * 4 * 0.1 = $108M\n60M * $2 * 4 * 0.05 = $24M\n\n\nThe estimated total annual revenue should be about $200M (round $67M + $108M + $24M = $199M)\nA strong candidate will recognize that there may be some error in this margin and might safeguard with a 20% margin. Go with $160M to be safe.\nNow the interviewer should guide the candidate to calculate the required growth:\n- in the first year, they could sell about $160M\n- in the second year, they could grow at requested 25% ($40M), so sell $200M in total\n- in the third year, they could grow another 25% ($50M) and have revenues of $250M.\n5. Final Recommendation\nIn the end, the candidate should present a short, summarized version of their findings which should include their target countries to enter as well as an estimate of the total possible annual revenue from each.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: reduce costs.\nConsulting Firm: Bain & Company first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: chemicals; airlines.\nCase Interview Question #00928: Our client Cabot Corporation (NYSE: CBT) is an American specialty chemicals and performance materials company headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. The company operates in over 20 different cities, with 36 manufacturing plants, 8 research and development (R&D) facilities and 28 sales offices  across the United States. Revenue in fiscal year 2012 was USD $3.3 billion.\nThe client Cabot Corporation has seen their profits declining in recent years and is looking at ways to improve profitability. Specifically, the firm has identified one potential cost saving area of interest that they wish us to advise them on: the company currently leases a Gulfstream private jet to take their senior executives to and from meetings in different cities in the US. The lease is set to expire in two weeks. What should they do? Should they renew the lease or not? What alternatives are available?\nPossible Answer:\n1. Suggested Structure \nThe candidate’s structure and list of investigative questions should ideally cover the following topics:\n• Details of the lease itself (length and payments)\n• Utilization of the aircraft (how many trips, to what cities, # of passengers, etc.)\n• A systematic list of alternative courses of action, along the following lines:\n- Renew the lease as is\n- Lease a smaller, lower-cost aircraft that still fits the needs of the firm\n- Do not least aircraft, but use alternative ways to attend meetings in different cities (commercial flights, train rides, video conferencing, etc.)\n- Buy a new airplane.\n2. Analysis\nThe interviewer can provide the following data and guidance to candidate ONLY when requested.\na. Cost of Existing Lease\nWhen the Candidate asks for the lease cost, ask Candidate to identify other costs (i.e. jet fuel, maintenance, crew, etc.). Once done, the interviewer can tell the candidate that the lease is the only fixed cost (75% of total cost, show the following Exhibit: breakdown of annual cost of leased jet) – remainder are variable costs.\n\nb. Utilization\nWhen asked, provide the following table as an Exhibit showing the # of trips and distance each way.\nTable 1. Jet Utilization Data\n\n\nCity\n# of trips\n1-way distance (miles)\n\n\nPhiladelphia\n100\n310\n\n\nNew York City\n50\n210\n\n\nCleveland\n50\n650\n\n\nc. Alternatives to Jet Lease\nThe interviewer should ask the candidate to list and discuss various alternatives. Look for structure and a methodical way of grouping and listing alternatives. Two in particular will receive deeper treatment.\n(1) Using commercial flights\nCons: loss of privacy when holding confidential discussions, loss of flexibility, being at whim of airline schedules.\nPros: Potentially less costly\nIf candidate asks how much a ticket costs, ask for an estimate. They should understand that these are executives and would require a first class seat. Once they give you an estimate, you may provide them with the following data.\nTable 2. Cost of Round-Trip First-Class Ticket\n\n\nCity\nCost\n\n\nPhiladelphia\n$1,200\n\n\nNew York City\n$600\n\n\nCleveland\n$1,400\n\n\nNormally, the candidate will get excited with the data and begin multiplying the ticket cost by the # of trips. However, they should understand that these are prices per ticket, and that oftentimes there is more than one executive traveling at the same time. At this point, you can give them the following graph as an Exhibit.\n\n*** You can assume that this holds true across all ftights to different cities.\nThe candidate can say that the overall average is about 5 passengers per flight. So, a new calculation table should look like this:\n\n\nCity\nFlights/year\nPassengers/flight\nTotal tickets needed\nCost/ticket\nTotal cost\n\n\nPhiladelphia\n 100\n 5\n 500\n $1,200\n $600K\n\n\nNew York City\n 50 \n5 \n250 \n$600 \n$150K\n\n\nCleveland\n 50 \n5 \n250 \n$1,400 \n$350K\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n$1,100K\n\n\n(2) Leasing other types of jets\nProvide the follwing table as an Exhibit\nTable 3. Other Types of Jets\n\n\n\nCurrent jet\nType 2\nType 3\n\n\nMaximum distance (miles)\n2,000\n1,500\n1,000\n\n\nMax # of passengers \n15 \n8 \n4\n\n\nCost of lease \n$1.5M \n$1M \n$500K\n\n\nCandidate should spot the following:\n• Max distance is not an issue, since the farthest city is Cleveland (650 miles one way).\n• Type 3 jet is too small and can be ruled out (assuming we don’t already have excess passengers for all past flights)\nKey Insight:\n• Type 2 jet should suffice for most trips and could therefore be a solid option.\n• However, the candidate must realize that this is only the cost of the lease and not the total cost. When asked, let the candidate know that the ratio of fixed to variable costs is similar across all aircraft types.\n– From the current jet type, Fixed Cost = 75% of Total Costs. Therefore, for Type 2 jet, the total cost = $1M / 75% = $1.333M.\nThe candidate gets bonus points for suggesting other ways to push costs down, e.g. by negotiating for multi-year lease discounts.\n3. Conclusion\nThe client should not renew their jet lease and should probably go with commercial airline to save cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: operations strategy, optimization; organizational behavior.\nConsulting Firm: L.E.K. Consulting first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: retail.\nCase Interview Question #00919: Our client Sainsbury’s Supermarkets Ltd operates a chain of supermarkets in the United Kingdom, with a share of the UK supermarket sector of 16.9%. The company is the second largest supermarket chain in the UK since 2014, and it places a great emphasis on a higher quality grocery offering compared to its other large rivals.\nWe were asked by the CEO of Sainsbury’s to design a new, more profitable type of supermarket for them. One of the key components of this work was to design the layout of the store – to decide where all the different types of goods should be located within the store. The supermarkets within the chain already had very different layouts. For example, some stores had the fruit and vegetables section near the entrance while some had placed this section near the exit, so that customers would probably buy fruit and vegetables last.\nThe people within the client company thought that goods placed “first-in-flow” (i.e., the goods that were the first items customers saw and bought) sold more. They thought that moving a section from last-in-flow to first-in-flow would increase its sales. How could you verify that this was true?\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate: You could experiment with one supermarket store. Change the location of a section and measure its sales. But, this will take time to do and will probably upset customers. Have any of the stores in the chain changed their layout recently? Are there records of the sales of each section before and after? Obviously, you would have to take account of other changes that were happening at the same time as the layout change, such as price changes or changes in the amount of space given to each section.\nYou could take advantage of the fact that the chain already has different layouts among its stores. Could you see whether sales of goods are higher when they are first in flow than when they are elsewhere? This may get complicated, since different stores may have different selling patterns due to other reasons (e.g., competition nearby, regional preferences of consumers, amount of space given to the goods).\nInterviewer: Let’s say that you did manage to prove it. You know that whatever you put first is likely to sell more than it would in another place. What types of goods would you think about putting first? Think of as many as you can.\nCandidate: How about:\n• Goods we think will show the greatest rise in sales if moved to the front.\n• Goods with the highest profit margin (i.e., if we make a 50 percent profit margin on our meat, but only a 5 percent profit on our cereals, we would make more profit if we put the meat first in flow).\n• Goods which consumers don’t have to buy. For example, they probably buy roughly the same amount of milk each week, and it would be hard for us to persuade them to buy more. On the other hand, if we put cakes or alcohol first, they may buy more than they normally would.\n• Goods which we had a lot of and which may go bad soon (i.e., special offers).\n(Note: there are many more suggestions.)\nInterviewer: When we surveyed customers, they said that they preferred to have fruit and vegetables last in flow so that the goods wouldn’t get squashed at the bottom of their grocery carts.\nHowever, we ended up recommending that fruit and vegetables should be put first. This wasn’t because of any of the reasons that you have already outlined. Why do you think it may have a benefit?\nCandidate: Was it because there was an overall effect on the store? Maybe people think the store offers fresh, cheap, healthy items if people see fruit and vegetables first?\nWas it for operational reasons – for example, nearer to the loading dock for faster/cheaper restocking of high turnover goods?\nInterviewer: At this stage, the interviewer may follow up on other topics, for example:\n• We found that some items in the store didn’t make much money – for example, the fresh fish counter. How would you decide whether this counter should be kept?\n• Do you think that the layout of each store in the supermarket chain should be the same? Why or why not?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new business.\nConsulting Firm: KPMG Advisory first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: property & casualty insurance.\nCase Interview Question #00920: Our client GEICO (short for The Government Employees Insurance Company) is an American auto insurance company headquartered in Chevy Chase, Maryland. It is the second largest auto insurer in the United States, after State Farm Insurance. GEICO writes private passenger automobile insurance in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. As of 2014 the company provides coverage for more than 22 million motor vehicles owned by more than 14 million policy holders.\nUntil recently, most car insurance was sold to car owners by insurance brokers. A car owner would call or visit an insurance broker who would suggest a range of different policies sold by different insurance companies. Insurance companies would then pay a commission to a broker for each policy sold.\nMore recently, car owners have started buying insurance directly from an insurance company over the phone. We were asked to work with GEICO that had been very successful in selling policies through brokers to help them figure out whether they should start selling their policies “direct” to customers over the phone. What would you recommend?\nPossible Answer:\nInterviewer: If you were a car owner, what might be the advantages of buying insurance direct from an insurance company over the phone versus buying from an insurance broker?\nCandidate: For example, an insurance broker may be able to provide a service in comparing different policies from different insurance companies. However, buying direct from an insurance company over the phone may be both cheaper (since there is no commission that has to go to a broker) and may be very convenient if done efficiently over the phone.\nInterviewer: What things would you need to consider to decide whether GEICO, the client company should start selling car insurance directly over the phone?\nCandidate: I would have to think about:\n(1) Potential Market Size\n• What is the existing market for direct selling? What is the market’s growth potential?\n• How many people will prefer to buy direct over the phone instead of visiting a broker?\n• Will the company’s existing business through brokers be in danger of declining?\n(2) Competition and Profitability\n• How profitable could the players in the market be?\n• What profit do the current direct sellers make versus what the companies selling through brokers make?\n• How competitive is the market?\n• Are there many players already?\n• Are there companies already selling direct that have a “head start”, such as a well known brand or many policies, which allows them to have lower costs?\n(3) Capabilities\n• How good could GEICO, this particular insurance company be at this business?\n• What would they have to be good at to do well in this business?\n• Do they have these skills?\n• Could they get them? At what cost?\n(4) Impact on Existing Business\n• Will selling direct to customers adversely affect the business sold through brokers, and does this matter?\n• Would brokers stop selling the insurance company’s policies if they knew that the company was also bypassing them and selling direct to car owners?\nAt this stage, the interviewer could follow up on any of the points raised in more detail. For example, he or she could ask:\n• How would you figure out how big the market for direct selling may be in 5 years’ time? Say at the moment that 20 percent of car owners buy their insurance over the phone directly from an insurance company.\n• How could you figure out what percentage this could be in 5 years’ time?\n• What do you think an insurance company selling direct to car owners over the phone has to be good at?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Headquartered in Kohler, Wisconsin, United States, Kohler’s bath and kitchen fixtures are available in American hardware and home improvement stores and from Kitchen and Bath distributors.\nThe CEO of The Kohler Company has asked us to help him examine the operations of his china products division. Kohler’s china products division produces bath and kitchen fixture including kitchen sinks, bath tubs, toilets, and urinals. Specifically, the CEO wants to know if he should approve a USD $200 million expenditure for building new manufacturing facilities. What would you recommend? What issues must be considered in making the decision?\nAdditional Information: to be given to candidate upon request\n• The Kohler Company is one of seven china products producers in the U.S.; the largest producer has a 20% market share; our client currently is ranked #3 at 15%. \n• Prices for the client’s china products are flat.\n• The largest two competitors appear to earn a small return; our client is roughly break-even.\n• The largest competitor has just announced plans for building a major modern plant.\nPossible Answers:\n1. Problem points of clarification:\n- Is the planned investment expected to lower costs? (Yes, but not substantially, with the major reason being that the new process will result in a better finish.)\n- Does the client company rely on a limited source of raw materials? (No, the materials are easy to get.)\n2. Minimum Answers:\na. Market Size/Growth:\n• What has the industry growth been? What is it projected to be over the next 10 or so years?\n• Is the growth linked to housing starts?\nb. Competitive Position:\n• How much overcapacity exists?\n• What are the competitors’ relative cost positions (i.e., are their costs to produce the product relatively lower or higher than our client’s)?\nc. Market Segmentation:\n• How is the market broken down (e.g., residential versus industrial versus commercial)?\n• Are different prices charged to different kinds of customers? Within different markets?\n3. Better Answers:\na. Customer-buying Factor:\n• Do customers demand a supplier that can also supply them with other building products?\nb. Barriers to Entry/Exit:\n• What is the minimum size of a new plant?\n• Generally, how expensive is entry/exit? Has there been a history of change in the industry players?\nc. Manufacturing:\n• Do the plants produce other products/contribute to overhead?\n• Are there ways in which costs can be substantially lowered?\n4. Outstanding Answers:\na. Marketing:\n• Has the industry generally been charging prices that make sense given the costs of production and the needs and sensitivities of various customer segments?\n• Have competitors ever announced capacity expansions before and then not implemented them?\n• Are there opportunities to change the product line to create a better fit with customer segments and production constraints?\n• Does the new finish that will result from the investment “pay for itself” with higher prices?\nb. Competitive Position:\n• How important is the product line to each competitor?\n• Are the products sold in combination (with each other, or with other products such as fittings)?\n• Would exiting the business affect the sales, products, or costs of other business units?\n• Are there advantages to plants being located in specific places due to high transportation costs?\n• If the competitor’s new plant is built, will others drop out?\nc. External Environment:\n• Is regulation important?\n• Are there changing demographics that will affect demand?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

From there the banking company has grown to serve many Chicago suburbs including northwest Indiana, downstate Illinois, and the Quad Cities area including Iowa. First Midwest Bank provides retail and business banking in 97 branches.\nRecently the client First Midwest Bank is attempting to increase its operating efficiency as a way to boost profitability. You have been asked to look at the non-interest, non-personnel expense base (i.e. purchases expenses) as a possible source of cost reduction opportunities. How would you determine the potential size of the cost reduction opportunity for increased operating efficiency? What issues might you run into as you begin such as study?\nPossible Answer:\nThis cost reduction case is asking you several questions simultaneously — most of them are related to the size of  cost reduction opportunity and the means by which you could measure and manage the opportunity.\n1. Opening\nExplore what kinds of information you would need to conduct such a study. Where would it come from? Often General Ledger and Accounts Payable systems do not provide the necessary information.\n2. Probing\n• What is the total expense base of the bank?\n• What portion of it consists of purchases expenses?\n• Is the organization centralized or decentralized in the way it purchases?\n• How would you determine whether certain groups of goods and services are more promising for reductions?\nMake assumptions based on the replies you get from the interviewer and clearly articulate them. The point is to interact with the interviewer and develop the case — and its solution — together.

(NYSE: UNH) is a large diversified managed health care company based in Minnetonka, Minnesota, United States. It offers a spectrum of products and services through two operating businesses, UnitedHealthcare and Optum, both subsidiaries of UnitedHealth Group. The company serves approximately 70 million individuals throughout the United States.\nBeginning in 2011 and continuing into 2012 the client UnitedHealth Group implemented an enterprise reorganization. They have brought in a team of management consultants to determine an appropriate strategy for improving their profitability through growth in the size of its operations. They hope to reach their profitability goals over the next three years. As one of the consultants working on this case, what would you do?\nPossible Answer:\nThis profitability case has no single right or wrong answer. Rather, the interviewer is interested in seeing  how you approach the problem. The key is to appear logical and to demonstrate an ability to move from the specifics of the case to the general issues involved in improving profitability anywhere. In other words, the case isn’t about health care at all. So don’t panic if you’re not an expert in the health care industry.\nRemember that the interviewer is principally looking for you to demonstrate analytical skill: How you think, how you structure a problem, and whether you are skilled at building a framework for thinking about a situation. You should be able to draw on models from competitive strategy, finance, marketing, operations, organization, or behavior. The point is this, however: You don’t need to reference them – just use them.\n1. Opening\nA good way to begin this case is to question whether expansion of operations is the right way to achieve their profitability goals.\n• Are they currently profitable? If not, growth just further destroys value and perhaps they must attack profitability from the cost side.\n• If they are currently profitable, then they have three options: increase sales, lower costs, or both.\nDon’t assume that growth is the only answer, show the interviewer that you would consider all options and understand both drivers of profitability – cost and revenues.\n2. Probing\nOnce you structure the options, the interviewer will lead you down the relevant path for this case, so follow the lead. If you’re told that the client company has low costs relative to the industry, then pursue the sales growth option. One way to structure your thinking about this problem would be to use a Growth Tree framework. Use the tree to think aloud for the interviewer and guide your questioning:\n“If the client company has two possible growth options – they can expand into existing businesses or diversify into new business. I think that growth in existing businesses should be considered first because that’s where they have core skills. In existing businesses they can grow their product market or consider vertical integration…”\nFeel out the interviewer: Where are the opportunities? What might be some options you can readily eliminate, e.g. is vertical integration really a viable option for a health-care provider?\nContinue to work through the growth tree systematically. If you ask about opportunities for pushing new products into existing markets and the interviewer seems very interested, pursue this path by offering suggestions for potentially viable new products.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: estimate, guesstimate.\nConsulting Firm: Mercer first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: automotive, motor vehicles.\nCase Interview Question #00914: How many taxicabs are there in New York City?\nPossible Answer:\nThink through the information you do have. Having spent a weekend in New York once, you may remember that there are five boroughs. You may have also noticed, however, that the vast majority of taxicabs are in Manhattan, with a smaller number at LaGuardia and JFK airports.\nConsidering Manhattan, then…conveniently, most of Manhattan has a grid-like street structure. The avenues are the north-south streets, which tend to be quite wide, typically 4-5 lanes. The numbered streets, running east-west, are more narrow and often only have 1-2 lanes of traffic. During rush hour, when most taxis are presumably out, roughly how many taxis are on a given block of an avenue or a street?\nOn the avenues, there are probably 1 taxi per lane, for a total of 4-5 taxis per block of avenue.  On the streets, there are probably 2 taxis per lane (blocks are rectangular, with the street side longer than the avenue side), for a total of 2-4 per block.\nHow many block of streets and avenues are there then? Estimate that there are roughly 15 avenues (any large street running north-south). There are approximately 150 east-west streets in the main part of Manhattan. So that means there are 15 x 150 = 2,250 blocks worth of avenues and streets.\nBut don’t forget that Central park covers a large area, roughly 50 blocks long and 3 blocks wide. So we need to reduce our blocks estimate by the 3 x 50 = 150 blocks in the park. So, 2,250 – 150 = 2,100 city blocks. To make the math easier, round to 2,000. For the avenues, we determined there were 4-5 taxis per block, and for the streets 2-4 per block. So, 4 x 2,000 = 8,000 taxis on the avenues at rush hour, and 2 x 2,000 = 4,000 taxis on streets. In total, 8,000 + 4,000 = 12,000 taxis in Manhattan.\nOne last detail – what about bridges, tunnels and airports? Estimate that there are 100 taxis somewhere on the premises of each of LaGuardia and JFK airport. That adds 200 to the number. Also assume that on each of the main bridges and tunnels which connect Manhattan to the airports, there are 100 taxis on average. If there are roughly 3 bridges or tunnels which are considered routes to the airports, that makes 300 additional taxis.\nAdding an additional 500 for the taxis on the freeways between tunnels/bridges and the airport, waiting in line at the train station, etc., our total number comes to 12,000 + 200 + 300 + 500 = 13,000.\nSanity Check: According to Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicabs_of_New_York_City), as of March 14, 2014, in New York City, there were 51,398 men and women licensed to drive medallion taxicabs. There were 13,605 taxicab medallion licenses in existence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Much like the transporter room on Star Trek’s Enterprise spaceship, people can step into the teleportation machine and, when the device is activated, are teleported instantaneously to the other place far far away.\nSpell out some of the effects on the transportation industry.\nPossible Answer:\nThis is an “industry analysis” type of case that calls for strategy analysis. First of all, remember not to make any assumptions. Don’t apologize for not watching the Star Trek show – ask your interviewer (who, if they’ve given you this question, is probably a Star Trek fan) how exactly the transporter works. Effectively, the transporter is a near-instantaneous teleportation device. However, you should make sure you don’t assume exactly what the transporter, as invented, can or can’t do. (In this case, non-Trekkies may have an advantage!)\nCandidate: Um, could you tell me exactly how the transporter works? How much can it transport at one time?\nInterviewer: Let’s say the transporter can transport about the mass of Captain Kirk.\nCandidate: That would be about 200 pounds. Can it transport only living things, or inanimate objects as well?\nInterviewer: Any type of object.\nCandidate: Can it transport anywhere at any time?\nInterviewer: Yes.\nCandidate: Does there need to be another transporter at the end to receive the transport?\nInterviewer: No, it’s pretty much a one-way process.\nCandidate: How common are these devices? Are they going to be readily available to the average consumer? How much do they cost?\nInterviewer: For the time being, the transporters are very expensive. They would cost about USD $50 million each.\nCandidate: That clearly takes them out of the range of most home users. How much does it cost to use them?\nInterviewer: Assume that the marginal cost of a transport is near zero. The only cost is for the transport-operator time, which is relatively small.\nCandidate: Are they safe? You said they were just invented.\nInterviewer: Except for the occasional freak accident, yes, they are safe. They are as safe as airplane travel.\nCandidate: That makes them very safe indeed. Okay, what I’m going to do is analyze how transporters will affect the following transportation industries: cars, passenger airlines, cargo shipping and package transport.\nInterviewer: Fine. Go ahead.\nCandidate: These transporters don’t seem like they’ll take the place of cars. They are too expensive for home use. Larger companies could afford them, however. I could see some companies buying transporters in order to transport their employees and clients back from the office. They would need a transporter chief, of course. So there might be some impact on commuter traffic – perhaps 10 to 20 percent. If mass transit systems adopt transporters as well, the impact on traffic may be greater.\nOn the other hand, the transporter is a terrific substitute for airplane travel. It’s instantaneous and from what you say, as safe as plane travel. The transporter will definitely be a serious competitor to airlines. Conceivably, passengers could be beamed directly to their destination, instead of going to the airport. The only drawback that I can see to the transporter is that any luggage would need to be beamed separately. And anyone weighing over 200 pounds may not be able to be beamed at all. This means that airplanes wouldn’t disappear, but they would be used mostly for cargo transport and other heavier loads. They would probably serve fewer markets, as there would be much-reduced passenger travel to supplement their flights.\nAs far as cargo, I think ships and planes would still be used for most cargo transport. Two hundred pounds is too small an amount for mass transport, and I’m assuming that you can’t separate the contents of a transporter, that you can only beam stuff to one area at once.\nInterviewer: That’s how I understand it, yes.\nCandidate: Then getting packages sent same day, to anywhere in the world, would be a premium service. You could only ship one package at a time. You might be able to charge double or triple the price of an overnight package. Shipping companies like Federal Express might profit from its introduction.\nInterviewer: Very good. Let’s wrap it up here.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

As a large holding company with a diverse portfolio, Crane Co.’s business segments include Aerospace & Electronics, Engineered Materials (fiberglass paneling and telecom equipment), Merchandising Systems (vending machines), Fluid Handling, and Controls (sensing and control systems).\nHeadquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, United States, the Crane Company was formed by acquisition of various small firms over the last 10 years and currently there are still some integration issues within the organization. The CEO would like to increase the ROIC (Return on Invested Capital) of the company from 10% to 20% in the next 3 years. Is it possible and how would you achieve this?\nAdditional Information: to be given to candidate if asked\n1. ROIC Definition \n• ROIC is Return on Invested Capital. This can be achieved by growing the profits of the firm and/or by decreasing the invested capital.\n• There are firms in the industry that have 20-30% ROIC. Hence the client’s target of 20% ROIC looks achievable.\n2. Customers and Products\n• The client has 30% customers in Europe, 10% in Asia, 50% in North America and 10% in the rest of the world.\n• The client has 2 types of products – Standard (almost a commodity) and Engineered (designed specifically for the client).\n• The standard products are getting commoditized, hence have significant price pressure.\n• The engineered products have good margins in the 1st year and then the margins decrease in subsequent 3-4 years.\n• The client has 30,000 SKUs in their product portfolio.\nThe industries that the client serves are as follows:\n\n\nIndustry\n% of Revenues\nStandard product\nEngineered product\n\n\nAutomotive\n55%\n65%\n35%\n\n\nElectronics \n25% \n45% \n55%\n\n\nConstruction\n 10%\n 75%\n 25%\n\n\nOthers \n10% \n70% \n30%\n\n\nNOTE: The interviewee should recognize the following by now based on the Customer/Product information\n• The client % revenues from Electronics industry are quite low and that industry has the highest % of Engineered products. The client should focus more closely on the Electronics industry.\n• Engineered products offer much higher margins.\n• 30,000 SKU seem like a lot, and should address that in the case as well. There will be interdependencies among these products.\n3. Competitive Landscape\n• This is a highly fragmented industry with 20,000 competitors.\n4. Investment/Cost\n• There are integration issues among the small companies under the client umbrella. The issues pertain to decentralized sourcing, sales staff and back office operations. These should be centralized to decrease cost (economies of scale) and improve coordination.\n• The product portfolio needs to be optimized. Evaluate profitability of each product along with its interdependency, i.e. its importance in a product portfolio supplied to important clients. Evaluate profitability of each client as well. Suggest using databases for this analysis.\n• Divest assets pertaining to certain non-profitable low volume standard products to decrease capital investment. If these components are still needed for a client portfolio investigate outsourcing their production and having exclusive contracts to maintain quality.\n• Evaluate the capacity utilization and supply chain for the 50 plants. Decrease investment if possible.\nPossible Solution:\nThe client can increase the ROIC from 10% to 20% by the following initiatives:\n• Optimize product mix while keeping product interdependencies in mind.\n• Sell more engineered products by growing business in electronics industry.\n• Decrease cost by improving the internal integration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The startup company’s business plan is very simple: they want to sell all kinds of hardware tools and home improvement items online on their e-commerce website www.iHardware.com.\nA private equity firm is a company that has raised money from individuals and institutions to invest in companies that may be a riskier investment but offer the promise of higher returns. Specifically, private equity firms often aim to find companies with strong growth potential that need a quick infusion of cash to help spur growth.\nMany private equity companies turn to Bain & Company because we can uniquely isolate the strategic issues that will determine the eventual success or failure of their investment. Private equity companies that use our services typically see returns two to three times their peer averages. In this case, we have also been offered the opportunity to invest in iHardware Inc. alongside the private equity client.\nThe startup company iHardware.com intends to serve the hardware, fixture and lumber needs of the home and small contractor market. It is not pursuing the larger builder market.\nOver the last ten years, home and small contractor consumers have moved away from buying items at local hardware stores and independent lumber companies and toward purchasing from large discount stores like Lowe’s and Home Depot.\niHardware believes that they can build a large and profitable franchise once they get started because of the large selection of goods to choose from and the loyalty of “do-it-yourselfers (DIY)”.\nThey also believe that as more people get into the hobby of doing things themselves, this market will continue to grow. As part of this trend, their business plan cites the success of gardening, woodworking and other home improvement shows and channels.\nIf started, this would be the first website of its kind.\nThe iHardware Mission Statement: (from their business plan) To provide the broadest selection of hardware, fixture and lumber products to the home and small contractor market.

(PMI) (NYSE: PM) is an American cigarette and tobacco company headquartered in New York City, New York, with products sold in over 200 countries and 15.6% of the international cigarette market outside the United States. The most recognized and best selling product of the company is Marlboro.\nThe CEO of Philip Morris is about the enter a meeting with the company’s Board of Directors. We are riding up to the 50th floor in the elevator with him. As we get in, the CEO turns to us, realizing that he has forgotten to include a key analysis in his upcoming presentation to the Board – one that could help him convince the Board to approve the building of a cigarette factory in Russia to serve the Moscow market. He needs an estimate of the demand for cigarettes in Moscow. We don’t have any data with us, and we have about five minutes before we reach the 50th floor. How would you estimate the demand for cigarettes in Moscow? What would the demand be?\nPossible Answers:\n1. Poor Answer \nCandidate: What? That would be impossible to do without researching statistics.\n* Lack of curiosity or genuine interest in solving complex problems; lack of comfort with ambiguity.\nInterviewer: We’re not expected to give a precise answer. Do your best at coming up with a back-of-the-envelope estimate.\nCandidate: Well…I know they smoke more in Russia than in the U.S., and I heard somewhere that Philip Morris makes more money in international markets than domestically, so the market must be big…\n* No structure; cannot frame the problem; limiting analysis to what little information he or she already knows – reluctant to push analysis further; lack of poise.\nInterviewer: Well, maybe we can start by estimating the number of smokers in Moscow.\nCandidate: Okay. I think the population in Moscow is about 10 million.\nInterviewer: Yes, that’s right.\nCandidate: Let’s say that half of them smoke.\nInterviewer: Well, in fact someone else on the team knows that 75 percent of adult in Moscow smoke.\nCandidate: Okay, 75 percent is 7,500 (wrong calculation!) people. And how many cigarettes do they smoke a day?\n* Failure to listen carefully to interviewer; overlooking important facts; no facility with numbers.\nInterviewer: We have to make an assumption there.\nCandidate: Alright, I’ll guess. Let’s say 1 pack a day, on average. That means 365 packs a year. 365 times 7,500 people is … is…. You want me to multiply that? (Interviewer nods. Candidate starts writing, thinks, pauses, becomes agitated.) Okay, that’s 1,537,500 cigarettes per year. That’s the answer. That wasn’t so hard.\n* No facility with numbers; careless calculations; forgot that he or she was calculating packs of cigarettes, not individual cigarettes; grew nervous under pressure; lacked creativity, etc.\nInterviewer: Well, we’re going to have to wrap up. What else would you have liked to have done with the analysis?\nCandidate: I would have liked to have had access to an encyclopedia to be able to figure out the real answer.\n* No creativity, interest in question, intellectual rigor, or synthesis.\n2. Good Answer\nCandidate: That’s an interesting question. Let’s see, how would I approach that if I were really there? Well, first of all, we should define what we mean by the size of demand. We could be measuring the number of cigarettes people in Moscow smoke, the number of cigarettes we think we can sell (assuming there are other brands in the market competing with us), the money we can make selling cigarettes, or maybe the outlook into the future, so the growth of cigarette consumption over the next few years. I guess the best answer would include all of that. But let’s start with the number of cigarettes people in Moscow smoke.\n* Demonstrates genuine interest in the problem and intellectual curiosity; frames the question well by stepping back to examine the question more broadly, assess what is meant by ‘demand’ and identify several layers of issues; clearly defined starting point to analysis; well-poised and articulate.\nInterviewer: Sounds good to me, go ahead.\nCandidate: Since this is a back-of-the-envelope estimate, we will have to make some assumptions. First, let’s assume the population of Moscow is 10 million, of which I guess about 75 percent are of smoking age. Of those 7,500,000 let’s say 50 percent smoke.\nInterviewer: Actually, somebody else on the team knows that 75 percent of adults smoke in Russia.\nCandidate: Okay. 75 percent of 7,500,000 is … 50 percent would be 3,750,000 plus half of that again is 1,500,000 … plus 375,000 … is 1,875,000 plus 3,750,000 is … (quickly jots notes on paper) … 5,625,000. But to make things simpler, I’ll round down to 5,500,000 if it’s okay with you.\n* Demonstrates facility with numbers (note that this candidate chose to make the math easier by using 50 percent as the multiplier, which is perfectly acceptable); comfortable with ambiguity; able to make reasonable assumptions.\nInterviewer: Sure.\nCandidate: So, now we need to know how much they smoke. Let’s say 1 pack a day on average, or about 400 packs a year, times 5,500,000 people is 2,200,000,000 packs a year. If we assume there are 20 cigarettes in a pack, that would be 4,400,000,000 cigarettes consumed per year.\nInterviewer: Are you sure that’s right?\nCandidate: 2,200,000,000 packs times 20 cigarettes in each pack is … oh, of course, 44,000,000,000 cigarettes. Sorry about that. Next, if I were the CEO, I’d like to know how much of that consumption I can expect to capture. Do we know what our share of the different world markets is?\n* Recovered well; showed poise under pressure; pushes the analysis to the logical next step.\nInterviewer: In the U.S., we have a 50 percent share, in France, we have a 25 percent share, in China, we have a 30 percent share, and in Hungary and Poland, we have a 75 percent share.\nCandidate: Well, not knowing the market dynamics that lead to these different situations around the world, I would say that the Russian market is probably pretty close to Poland and Hungary. But let’s be conservative, and say that we feel confident that we can achieve 60 percent share, which would be 22,000,000,000 plus 4,400,000,000 is 26,400,000,000 cigarettes a year or 1,320,000,000 packs per year.\n* Good logic; comfortable with ambiguity; facility with numbers (again, the candidate chose to break down the multiplication).\nInterviewer: That’s great. We’re running out of time. Anything else you would have liked to have done with the analysis?\nCandidate: I would have liked to have gotten a sense of how much demand will grow over the next few years, which would be a function of population growth, growth of smokers as a percent of the population, and the amount each smoker consumes. I also would have liked to compare our estimate of demand for cigarettes in Moscow with demand in a comparably-sized city like New York City, just to make sure that it makes sense intuitively. For example, I would definitely expect the size of demand in NYC to be smaller. But for now, I guess all we can tell the CEO is that he needs a factory which will produce somewhere in the range of 1.3 billion packs of cigarettes a year.\n* Shows genuine interest and creativity; pushes analysis to the next level; sums up analysis with concise recommendation to CEO.\nInterviewer: Very good. Thank you.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: business turnaround; reduce costs.\nConsulting Firm: Aon Hewitt first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: containers, packaging.\nCase Interview Question #00869: Your client CCL Industries Inc. is an aerosol can manufacturer based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The company provides steel aerosol can products to the Home & Personal Care, Food & Beverage, Healthcare and Specialty markets worldwide. They buy sheet steel, cut it into shape, paint it, weld it into a cylinder, apply a top and bottom and then sell them to their customers. They do not fill the can with aerosol spray content.\nAerosol spray is a type of dispensing system which creates an aerosol mist of liquid particles. This is used with a can that contains a payload and propellant under pressure. When the can’s valve is opened, the payload is forced out of a small hole and emerges as an aerosol or mist.\nOver the last 5 years the client CCL Industries has increased their sales from USD $400M to $600M, but their profits have decreased from USD $50M to -$200M. They want to know what they should do to turn around their failing business.\nAdditional Information: to be provided to candidate after relevant questions\n• Depreciation costs are the same and there has been no additional fixed asset expenditure.\n• The client CCL Industries has seen a steep increase in labor cost. The increases account for about a third of the total cost increase.\n• Their pricing basis is Steel price + Value added, so they automatically pass on all cost increases/savings to their customers.\n• 5 years ago the average price we get for an aerosol can is $1 and now it is $3. What does it mean?\n• The costs of paint have increased by $200M over the last 5 years.\n• Painting aerosol can is a capacity limiting step.\n• The client company is foregoing additional sales – and have an opportunity cost associated with this, but that hits the top line, not the bottom line.\n• Our customer requirements have changed: they are demanding higher quality for the aerosol can.\n• Historically we sold 40% to industrial clients, 30% into household applications and 30% into consumer packaged goods. This has now changed to 20%, 30%, 50%.\n• For industrial clients we used stickers rather than paint.\nPossible Solution:\nFirst, I set up a calculation table:\n\n\n\n\n5 years ago\nCurrent\n\n\nRevenue\n$400M\n$600M\n\n\nProfit\n$50M\n-$200M\n\n\nCost\n$350M\n$800M\n\n\nPrice\n$1\n$3\n\n\nSales Volume\n400M\n200M\n\n\n\nThe cost basis has increased by $450M over the last 5 years and I will start by looking at why these costs may have increased so much.\n• Of the $450M total cost increase, $200M is due to the increased costs of paint.\n• Of the $450M total cost increase, a third or $150M is increase in labor cost.\n• The rest $100M cost increase is caused by increased steel price over the last 5 years.\nBecause the client automatically passes on all cost increases to their customers, the unit price for their aerosol can products has increased from $1 to $3. The price hike hurts their sales badly: sales volume has dropped 50% over the last 5 years.\nConclusion:\nThe reason our client CCL Industries is loosing money is their shift to the higher priced consumer segment. The additional quality requirements in this segment, in particularly on the painting side, have limited our capacity and increased our cost basis.\nOver the next weeks my team is going to look at the following issues: costs and benefits of capacity addition, outsourcing the painting to a 3rd party and growing their industrial part of the business again.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The company currently sells its products in more than 180 countries and districts and maintains 140 factories in various countries and districts. It is by far the largest manufacturer and marketer of chewing gum in the United States.\nThey have 25% profit margins and have been traditionally focused on gum and mints. A new CEO has just been appointed and he has promised the GumCo shareholders that he would double revenues, while maintaining profit margins, over the next four years. Their current revenue is USD $2.7 billion (fiscal year 2015). The new CEO comes to you for help. What would you recommend the GumCo CEO to do?\nAdditional Information: to be provided to candidate after relevant questions\n1. Product \n• GumCo has two product lines: gum and mints\n• Gum is 75% of total revenue, Mints are 25% of total revenue\n• Gum is growing at 4% annually\n• Mints are growing at 7% annually\n2. Market\n• We don’t think we can steal any more market share from our US competitors\n• We have a very strong brand, built over several years.\n• No possibility of growth through innovation.\n• Total size of Asian market = $2.5B\n• Total size of Japan market = $1.6B\n3. Acquisition Target\nThere are two companies we could acquire:\n• Company A: a juice company with strong brand equity and distribution system in Japan.\n• Company B: a chocolate company with weak brand equity in the US.\nExhibit 1. Worldwide Market Share\n\nExhibit 2. US Gum Prices\n\nPossible Solution:\nThis is a “increasing revenue” type of case. First, I structured the case by applying the “revenue growth” framework:\n• Growth In Existing Market\n• Growth In A New Market (Geographically)\n• Growth In A Related Market – Leverage Skills\n• Growth In Unrelated Market\nSecond, as I gained new information from the interviewer (see “Additional Information” above). I calculated the exact savings from each action. The goal, encouraged by the interviewer, was to add up to $2.7B in revenue.\nThird, I estimated the amount of market share that could be gained in each market based on our brand transferability, the size of the competitors and the growth of the market.\nFourth, I recommended acquiring the juice company since it was overall a stronger business and allowed us to enter the Japanese market. The chocolate company was tempting since it is also sold in the candy aisle, but our brand would not leverage well into the candy segment. Additionally, the customer in candy was much younger than our average customer (mints and gum customers are older). Our customer is more similar to juice customer.\nMy result was:\n• Home Market Growth: $0.6B\n• Price Increase: $0.5B\n• Increase in Asia Presence $0.9B\n• Increase in Japan Presence $0.3B\n• Growth through Acquisition $0.4B\n• Total Improvement: $2.7B\nOther points would be: implementation risks and challenges of entering new markets.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Recently, they experienced a drop in both sales and profits. Linens ‘n Things hired your consulting firm to find the root causes and come up with solutions to improve the situation. What would you recommend?\nAdditional Information: to be provided to candidate after relevant questions\n• Both sales and profits declined over the last 3 years or so, having grown steadily prior to that point. \n• There are three segments in the home goods market: discount stores (e.g. Target), specialty stores (e.g. Bed, Bath, and Beyond), and other stores (e.g. Linens ‘n Things).\n• Overall market size (in terms of sales) has increased over the last 3 years, with discount and specialty segments growing and “other” segment (the client fell into this category) declining.\n• Our client Linens ‘n Things did somewhat better than its segment average, but worse than the overall market.\n• The client Linens ‘n Things is ”stuck” in its segment.\n• Cost structure of the three segments.

(occasionally known as Aéro) is an American shopping mall-based specialty retailer of casual apparel and accessories, principally targeting ages 14-to-40 year old men and women through its Aéropostale stores. Headquartered in New York City, New York, the company maintains control over its proprietary brands by designing, sourcing, marketing and selling all of its own merchandise.\nOver the last ten years, the client Aéropostale has expanded their number of store locations and achieved significant sales growth. As a result, they are considering an IPO (initial public offerings) in 6 to 12 months. However, recently the company has moved from profits to losses. The CEO of Aéropostale needs to understand why this has occurred, and what needs to be done to become profitable again.\nAdditional Information: to be provided to candidate after relevant questions\n1. Revenue \nWhen asked about revenue growth, the Interviewer produced this graph:\n\n2. Number of Store Locations\nWhen asked about the number of store locations, the Interviewer produced this graph:\n\n3. Costs\n• Assume fixed costs of $1 million per store location. This includes lease costs, utilities, store manager, etc.\n• Assume variable costs equal to 20% of sales. This includes cost of clothing, sales people, etc.\n• Corporate overhead is minimal.\nPossible Solution:\nThe key to this profitability case is to notice that sales increased for the first location over time. In year 2009, the company would have made a profit of $600,000 on sales of $2MM ($2MM*80% profit margin – $1MM fixed cost = $600,000). Subsequent store openings should experience similar sales ramp up. Once the candidate realizes this, then it becomes apparent that the client is realizing losses because of the large number of stores opened recently.\nRecommendations for the client include:\n1. If the client wants to go IPO and show significant profits, then they must slow the rate of store openings so that a larger percentage of stores have entered the profitable portion of their life cycle.\n2. Develop performance reporting systems which will allow the company management to assess the profitability of individual store locations, rather than reviewing financial performance in aggregate.\n3. Review performance of successful store locations to understand what reasonable performance levels are for new store locations at various points in their life cycle. Use these hurdles to assess the performance of newer locations, and determine whether some locations should be closed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

We have been asked by the CEO of Sky Deutschland to decide whether to broadcast it on their pay-TV channel or on the free channel also owned by the client. What would you recommend?\nAdditional Information: to be provided to candidate after relevant questions \nThe interviewee has to come up by himself/herself with notion of incremental revenues and cost of serving and acquiring customers.\n• The revenue sources for the two options are: Ads for free TV and additional subscribers for pay TV.\n• In first round of the UEFA Champions League football tournament, there are 8 groups with 4 teams each. Each team plays with each other team within their group in a double round-robin system (with home and guest games) in the first round. There are 3 German teams. They are all in different groups. We are going to broadcast only games with their participation in first round. The eight group winners and eight runners-up proceed to the next round knockout phase, with home and guest games: 1/8 finals. Third round is quarterfinals, also with home and guest games. Then semifinals come. And then final – only one game. 30 seconds of ads are $50K at any stage. A game has 25 min of ads.\n• If we decide not to broadcast the game on free TV, we will still get the same minutes of advertising at $20K/minute.\n• If we decide to broadcast on pay-TV, we will get 1 million more subscribers.\n• Customer acquisition cost is $10 per new customer and it costs $6 per year to serve one customer.\n• Pay TV: Subscription fee is $20. Price per month is $7.\n• No customers will leave if the client decides not to broadcast the tournament on pay-TV.\n• Project only for 1 year.\nPossible Solution:\n1. Number of games to broadcast\n1st round: 12 × 8 = 96 games in total, 3 × 6 = 18 games to broadcast (only 3 German teams)\n2nd round (1/8 finals): 2 × 8 = 16 games\n3rd round (quarterfinals): 2 × 4 = 8 games\nSemifinals: 2 × 2 = 4 games\nFinal: 1 game\nTotal: 18 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 1 = 47 games.\n2. Free TV\nAd revenue per game = 25 × 2 × $50K = $2.5M\nWe have also the opportunity cost. With no game broadcasting we can get $20K per minute.\nIncremental revenue per game = 25 × ($100K – $20K) = $2M\nTotal incremental revenue = 47 × $2M = $94M\nNo additional cost.\n3. Pay TV\nIncremental revenue will be 1M × ($20 + $7 × 12) = $104M.\nBut the acquisition cost is $10 per new customer and it costs $6 per year to serve one customer.\nIncremental profit will be $104M – 1M × ($10 + $6) = $88M.\nConclusion: Given this information, the incremental profit for pay-TV is $88M and for free-TV is $94M. Our client should broadcast the games on free-TV.\nNote to Interviewer: push the interviewee to come up with exact numbers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: operations strategy.\nConsulting Firm: Boston Consulting Group (BCG) first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: food & beverages.\nCase Interview Question #00909: Your client is the sugar cereal division of General Mills Inc. (NYSE: GIS), an American multinational distributor and manufacturer of packaged foods. Headquartered in the Minneapolis suburb of Golden Valley, Minnesota, the General Mills company markets many well known North American brands, such as Betty Crocker, Yoplait, Colombo, Totino’s, Pillsbury, Green Giant, Old El Paso, Häagen-Dazs, Cheerios, Trix, Cocoa Puffs, and Lucky Charms.\nAccording to the sugar cereal division president, General Mills Inc.’s traditional strength has been with grocery stores, which still account for the majority of its $1.1 billion in sugar cereal sales. But Walmart (NYSE: WMT), a discount chain, has been growing at a healthy rate of almost 15% per year and has now become General Mills’ largest customer. Your client is not sure how to react, and has asked Boston Consulting Group (BCG) for assistance with its distribution strategy. What would you recommend?\nPossible Answer:\n1. Establish understanding of the case  \nCandidate: First, let me make sure I understand the problem. Our client General Mills specializes in sugar cereals traditionally distributed through grocery stores. Sales to Walmart, a discount chain, have been growing at 15 percent per year, and the chain has recently become the largest distributor of the client’s product nationwide. We are here to help evaluate the distribution strategy in light of Walmart’s growth.\nInterviewer: That is correct.\nCandidate: Could you explain to me how grocery stores differ from discount stores?\nInterviewer: Sure. Grocery stores generally specialize in food, as well as selling some household goods and over-the-counter pharmaceuticals. Discount stores such as Walmart, Target, etc, on the other hand, offer food alongside a wide variety of merchandise, including clothing, home electronics, and housewares.\nCandidate: Does Walmart market its food products differently than do grocery stores?\nInterviewer: Discount stores advertise lower prices for a wide variety of foods, particularly staple, nonperishable foods.\nCandidate: Could I take a moment to write a few notes to myself?\nInterviewer: Please feel free.\n2. Set up the framework\nCandidate: Before making recommendations, I think we would need to evaluate whether sales growth at Walmart is good or bad for General Mills. To do that, I would first look at how its sugar cereal performance at Walmart compares with that in other distribution channels. Second, I would look at its performance at Walmart in relation to competitors’ performance. Next, I would determine what drives customer purchases. Finally, I would want to understand the supply chain.\nInterviewer: That certainly sounds like a reasonable approach. Let’s proceed.\n3. Evaluate the case using the framework\nCandidate: First, I would like to get a better sense of where Walmart stands in relation to our client’s other distribution channels by examining the client’s sales data and margins, by distributor.\nInterviewer: The marketing department does not have margins by channel, but tracks sales and volume for its top five distributors.\n\n\nSales ($M)\n2013\n2014\n2015\n5-Year CAGR\n\n\nWalmart\n142\n162\n246\n14.7%\n\n\nR.J.’s\n157\n185\n200\n6.2%\n\n\nBozo Mart\n143\n175\n189\n7.3%\n\n\nAce Grocery\n101\n109\n153\n11.0%\n\n\nShoppers Mart\n57\n62\n67\n4.0%\n\n\nTotal Top 5\n600\n693\n856\n9.3%\n\n\nTotal All Distributors\n1,000\n1,079\n1,150\n3.6%\n\n\n\n\nVolume (M boxes)\n2013\n2014\n2015\n5-Year CAGR\n\n\nWalmart\n65\n74\n113\n14.7%\n\n\nR.J.’s\n72\n81\n85\n4.2%\n\n\nBozo Mart\n65\n77\n80\n5.2%\n\n\nAce Grocery\n46\n47\n64\n8.8%\n\n\nShoppers Mart\n26\n27\n28\n2.0%\n\n\nTotal Top 5\n274\n307\n370\n7.8%\n\n\nTotal All Distributors\n450\n468\n487\n2.0%\n\n\nWhat does this imply about Walmart as a distribution outlet?\nCandidate: It looks as if the top distributors have been growing more important, but particularly Walmart, which is growing faster than all the others. This is particularly true when we look at volume, where Walmart’s growth is much higher than that of the other four channels.\nInterviewer: And how could you interpret what these data says about margins?\nCandidate: While the client’s sales through other distribution channels are growing faster than volume, Walmart volume and sales growth are the same, so the average price paid by Walmart has remained constant. That implies that sales growth at Walmart could have negative implications for our client’s margins.\nNext, I would like to look at how our client is doing in relation to the competition within Walmart. Have they been gaining or losing market share?\nInterviewer: How might you find that out?\nCandidate: I would try to interview Walmart’s purchasing personnel, since they would probably track those data for their own purposes.\nInterviewer: Why would they want to talk to you? How might you approach such an interview?\nCandidate: I would approach the purchasing personnel and suggest that our client and Walmart work together to identify best practices to reduce costs and increase sales of sugar cereals at Walmart.\nInterviewer: Let’s say in a perfect world you could get a breakdown of Walmart sales for the four largest competitors (see market shares below).\n\nWhat can we infer about our client’s competitors within this channel? Who should they be worried about?\nCandidate: It looks like our client is losing market share, as is Tasty Breakfast, while Cereal Co. and Private Label are gaining share. Private Label, however, looks to be growing from a very small base.\nI would like to explore why our client is losing market share to Cereal Co. at Walmarts. Are their prices better than those of our client?\nInterviewer: After a period of price wars six to seven years ago that lowered industry margins, the cereal companies have refrained from price competition within the same channel.\nCandidate: If prices are not driving the difference, I would look at other factors such as brand selection, percentage of shelf space, product placement, and in-store promotions.\nInterviewer: Visits to Walmarts indicate that each name-brand company holds 30 percent of the shelf space, while private label has 10 percent. Cereal Co. brands, however, tend to be placed lower on the shelf than your client’s products.\nCandidate: Well, I suspect that children are a large target market for the sugar cereal manufacturers. The lower shelf placement could be especially important to children who are looking at the different types of cereals. Are there any other promotions?\nInterviewer: Some Cereal Co. brands have sales promotion tags, and the team notes that store flyers advertise specials on Cereal Co. brands for Walmart customer cardholders.\nCandidate: So, even if all the companies are maintaining product prices, maybe Cereal Co. is strategically discounting prices to gain market share.\nInterviewer: It seems as if there is evidence of cooperation between Cereal Co. and Walmart. Do we know anything about their relationship?\nDuring earlier discussions with Walmart, you discovered that your client’s competitors have 50 sales representatives dedicated to the Walmart account. Your client has seven.\nCandidate: Cereal Co. appears to be dedicating more resources to its relationship with Walmart than our client is. This may explain its better product placement and promotion programs.\nI think I have a good sense of distribution and competition. I would now like to look at the customers and understand why they select the products they do. One hypothesis I have is that shifting brand loyalties are hurting our client’s market share at Walmart.\nInterviewer: That’s interesting. What do you think might motivate purchases of sugar cereals?\nCandidate: There are lots of factors, such as the games in the boxes, the price of the cereal itself, how it tastes. To better understand consumer behavior, we might conduct market research, possibly through focus groups, customer observation, and price sensitivity studies.\nInterviewer: BCG teams often do such research. Let’s assume your team conducts some analysis. Your research concludes that most buyers tend to fall into two categories. Approximately 60 percent of buyers go straight to one cereal and grab it. We can call this group the “brand-loyal” shoppers. Another 40 percent of shoppers look at all the cereals and then select one that interests them. Let’s call this group the “impulse” buyers.\nCandidate: For the brand-loyal shopper, the priority would be product availability, while product placement would be important for consumers who like to shop around.\nWithin these groups, are consumers price sensitive such that one brand can lure shoppers loyal to another brand?\nInterviewer: In general, your research indicates that consumers are not price sensitive and are extremely loyal to their preferred brand. But when the preferred cereal is unavailable, the brand-loyal customers will purchase discounted cereals approximately 35 percent of the time.\nCandidate: Well, from that information, it appears that price is not a major driver of purchases unless the preferred cereal is out of stock. In these stock-out situations, you said, brand-loyal customers will purchase discounted cereals 35 percent of the time. What happens when the customer does not purchase a discounted cereal?\nInterviewer: In approximately 25 percent of cases, the customer walks away without purchasing any cereal at all. In the remaining 40 percent of cases, the brand-loyal customer will act like an impulse shopper and select another brand.\nCandidate: Interesting. It seems as if product availability could be a major driver of total cereal volume for Walmart. Of course, we would need to know how often stock-outs occur that cause consumers to walk away without purchasing cereal occur.\nSince I have a pretty good understanding of customer motivation, I’d now like to ask a few questions about the client’s supply chain. I would want to talk to our client’s distribution personnel to understand the distribution process and to determine how often stock-outs occur. Can you describe how our client’s cereal is distributed at Walmart?\nInterviewer: Cereals are distributed from the factory to the distributor’s warehouse twice monthly. The retailer then stocks the shelves itself.\nCandidate: Do we have any knowledge about when the individual stores are out of stock?\nInterviewer: No, we do not, since our client only delivers to the warehouses and has no direct access to in-store inventory information.\nCandidate: Since we identified product availability as a key success factor earlier on, I would want to make sure that the stores were stocking the product correctly.\nInterviewer: Let’s say that in your earlier in-store investigations, you found out that Walmart stores averaged 15 percent of sugar cereal brands out-of-stock, across all brands.\nCandidate: Stock-outs would be a major problem for our client, since 60 percent of customers look for a specific brand of cereal and 35 percent of them would buy a discounted brand in a stock-out situation. Walmart would also have an incentive to reduce out-of-stock incidents, since 25 percent of the time, a brand-loyal customer will walk away without buying anything.\n4. Summarize and make recommendations\nCandidate: Walmart is our client’s leading customer, accounting for more than 20 percent of our client’s sugar cereal revenue. Although sales to Walmart are increasing on an absolute basis, our client’s margins there are lower than in its other channels and its competitive position is eroding in that channel.\nAt Walmart, our client faces competition from both private label and Cereal Co., although the latter appears to be the greater threat. There appears to be a relationship between Walmart and Cereal Co. as evidenced by their joint promotions, the superior placement of the Cereal Co. product, and the substantial resources that Cereal Co. has dedicated to the Walmart account.\nWe learned that 60 percent of customers are brand-loyal, implying product availability is most important. However, 40 percent like to try different kinds of cereal, indicating product placement is also important. Purchasers do not appear to be price conscious, unless the type of cereal they are looking for is out of stock, in which case there is a stronger tendency to base purchases on price promotions.\nIn terms of distribution, our client is making deliveries twice a month to Walmart’s warehouses. Walmart, in turn, is responsible for stocking the shelves. We currently have no direct knowledge of when our client’s items are out of stock at the individual stores, but there is evidence that stock-outs do occur with some frequency.\nInterviewer: Well, it sounds as if you understand the situation. What would you recommend the client do?\nCandidate: The sales through Walmart appear to have a negative impact on the bottom line, as they have lower margins than sales through grocery stores. The client could work with grocery stores to ensure that they are able to compete effectively with Walmart in the sugar cereal market. This strategy could be risky, however, since Walmart is a large and important customer. Therefore, I would recommend that our client work more collaboratively with Walmart.\nTo defend its current position at Walmart stores, the client should move toward a partnership with Walmart and dedicate more resources to the relationship. The customer and competitor data indicate that our client’s first priority should be to improve distribution to ensure better product availability. In addition, it should push for product placement equal to, if not better than, that of its competitors.\nInterviewer: Why would Walmart be willing to enter into a partnership with General Mills?\nCandidate: General Mills could offer to share its information about customer behavior to help increase revenues for both itself and Walmart. Stock-outs hurt Walmart in two ways. First, some brand-loyal customers simply walk away without purchasing cereal whenever their preferred brand is unavailable. Second, we know that other brand-loyal customers purchase lower-priced cereal whenever they encounter a stock-out of their preferred brand. Both of these instances lower Walmart’s revenue.\nBy eliminating stock-outs, Walmart could increase its sales by simply ensuring that customers don’t walk away without making a purchase. Converting these purchase occasions to sales would increase Walmart’s sales of sugar cereals by more than 2 percent (1).\nBetter availability also helps Walmart and our client increase their revenue by deterring the brand-loyal shoppers from trading down to lower-priced cereals. Recall that 35 percent of the brand-loyal shoppers purchase a discounted cereal if their preferred brand is not available. If improved distribution now makes the preferred brands more consistently available, the customers will pay a higher price for these products.\nFinally, we could use the information about consumer purchase behavior to help persuade Walmart to share information about product availability in its individual stores. We could work with our client and Walmart to improve the current distribution system to allow for more economical deliveries, while at the same time ensuring that our client’s product is consistently available in the store.\nInterviewer: Thank you. Those sound like solid recommendations, but I would suggest that you fully understand the root cause of the stock-out situations and the cost to eliminate them before moving ahead.\n(1) 15% out of stock x 60% brand-loyal customers x 25% willing to forgo purchase = 2.25% \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: reduce costs.\nConsulting Firm: Boston Consulting Group (BCG) final round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: Aerospace & Defense.\nCase Interview Questions #00910: Your client Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) is an American global aerospace, defense, security and advanced technologies company with worldwide interests. It was formed by the merger of Lockheed Corporation with Martin Marietta in March 1995. Headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, in the Washington, DC, area, Lockheed Martin employs 126,000 people worldwide. The company is one of the world’s largest defense contractors based on revenues.\nYour client Lockheed Martin manufactures the Mohawk Light Fighter Jet for the British Royal Air Force. The company has produced the $20 million fighter jet for the past 12 years. The British government recently has decided to put the contract out to bid, however, and to win the program, the client’s purchasing agents have estimated, the company will need to cut its costs by 5%. It has asked Boston Consulting Group (BCG) to help it reduce costs. How would go about it?\nPossible Answer:\n1. Establish understanding of the case\nCandidate: Let me first clarify the question. The client manufactures a $20 million jet and, because of competitive forces, has to reduce its cost by 5 percent. Is BCG’s role also to verify the purchasing department’s estimate?\nInterviewer: No, you can assume that the purchasing estimate is correct. BCG’s role is to find the cost savings to meet that estimate.\nCandidate: Could I take a few minutes to think about the case?\nInterviewer: Sure, please do so.\n2. Set up the framework\nCandidate: First, I would like to understand the cost structure of the jet to see what we should look at first. Next, I would like to look at major factors driving the costs we are targeting. Finally, I would like to explore potential ideas to reduce cost.\nInterviewer: That sounds like a very logical approach. Let’s proceed.\n3. Evaluate the case using the framework\nCandidate: Because the time for the interview is limited, I think we should try to identify those areas most responsible for the cost of the jet.\nInterviewer: Time is limited on real projects as well, so I think that would be a good idea! You have the following cost information for the jet. How would you interpret it?\n\nCandidate: The major cost driver for the jet appears to be purchased materials. Within manufacturing, direct labor is a fairly large component of cost, as are program management and corporate overhead within overhead. I think we would want to concentrate most on materials, however, since that’s where most of the costs can be found.\nInterviewer: That sounds like a good place to start. Where would you look within materials?\nCandidate: I see that materials are broken down into purchased subassemblies, components, and raw materials. I understand what raw materials would be, but what would be the difference between components and subassemblies?\nInterviewer: A subassembly functions on its own. An example is the pilot night vision system. A component is a smaller part, such as a part of the engine.\nCandidate: I know that governmental agencies often have very strict guidelines about purchasing that could affect the cost of materials.\nInterviewer: For the sake of this case, you can assume that the British Ministry of Defense, MOD, allows “commercial off-the-shelf” purchases, which means that the client is free to purchase from whomever it wants, as long as it can ensure that the parts meet MOD quality guidelines.\nCandidate: I see that purchased subassemblies comprise more than 70 percent of materials. How many suppliers are there for these subassemblies?\nInterviewer: There are seven suppliers of major subassemblies that go into the fighter jet.\nCandidate: That seems like a relatively small number. Are there more suppliers that are qualified to do this type of work?\nInterviewer: The manufacture of these parts requires a substantial investment in R&D, engineering, and infrastructure. It would be very costly for new suppliers to make the required investment, particularly if the client is trying to reduce the price it pays to the subassembly manufacturers.\nCandidate: Since there are only a few subassembly suppliers, and the investment hurdle would preclude bringing in competing manufacturers, it would be difficult to reduce the price paid. Perhaps we should look elsewhere for savings.\nInterviewer: But remember, if your client loses the contract, it will lose its customer unless it is teamed with the competing bidder. Even then, if the competitor is underbidding your client, there will be even less room for it to profit.\nCandidate: Perhaps it would have an incentive to reduce its costs in order to maintain the contract. Are the majority of its costs in materials as well?\nInterviewer: How could you find that out?\nCandidate: I would want to interview the purchasing and engineering personnel of the different subcontractors in order to understand their cost structures. If we had a better understanding of their economics, our client might be able to reduce cost across the board, allowing it to compete more effectively for the contract without killing everyone’s margins.\nInterviewer: Let’s say that purchased materials average approximately 70 percent of the price paid to most of the manufacturers.\nCandidate: If the cost of subassemblies represents 40 percent of the jet cost and 70 percent of that is purchased materials, total purchased materials would be approximately 28 percent of the jet cost subassemblies. Purchases of raw materials and components represent another 15 percent, for a total of around 43 percent of the cost of the jet. If our client could reduce the cost of raw materials by 20 percent, it could reduce the cost of the jet by more than 8 percent, more than enough to offset the 5 percent reduction it would need to win the contract.\nInterviewer: That sounds reasonable, but 20 percent is a very lofty goal. How would you go about doing that?\nCandidate: First, I would look at the number of suppliers. Are there a large number of suppliers to the subassembly manufacturers?\nInterviewer: The client estimates that there are approximately 125 suppliers of raw materials and components among the manufacturers of the subassemblies and itself.\nCandidate: Well, that sounds like a large number of suppliers. Of course, they could be providing very specialized materials to the subassembly manufacturers. Are these suppliers providing customized or more commodity products?\nInterviewer: About 80 percent of these products are commodities, such as sheet metal and wire harnesses. Even some of the electronics, such as printed wire boards and circuitry, are fairly generic.\nCandidate: That sounds promising, but I would need to know whether these commodities are interchangeable, so that our client could concentrate spending with fewer suppliers. Are there many commonalities among the parts used by the different subassembly manufacturers? We could talk to their engineers and look at the designs and bills of material to determine how much overlap there is.\nInterviewer: Let’s say that you did this and discovered that approximately 30 percent of the cost of raw materials is from similar materials used across the subassembly manufacturers.\nCandidate: It seems safe to assume that the client would need more commonality to be successful in concentrating its purchasing and reducing costs. Do the engineers believe that the percentage of overlap could be increased if the designs were modified?\nInterviewer: They believe they could increase that percentage substantially, particularly with basic materials such as screws and sheet metal, but also in other more customized areas.\nCandidate: That’s great news, but we would still need to know whether the subcontractors are using the same suppliers. We could analyze the number of suppliers for each of the areas of overlap.\nInterviewer: Good suggestion. Although there are some common suppliers, the analysis indicates that the subassembly manufacturers tend to use different suppliers.\n4. Summarize and make recommendations\nCandidate: Our client needs to reduce costs by 5 percent. The largest area of opportunity appears to be in purchased materials, the majority of which comprise subassemblies manufactured by seven subcontractors. By looking at its purchases in total, the client can target approximately 40 percent of costs. To achieve the 5 percent cost reduction, it would need to reduce materials costs by 15 to 20 percent. It could try to do that by increasing commonality in the design of the subassemblies and components and by shifting volume to a smaller number of suppliers.\nInterviewer: Considering that the majority of the raw materials and components are purchased commodities, do you think the 15-20 percent cost reduction is achievable?\nCandidate: Well, I know that raw materials and components typically have lower margins than more customized products. I suspect it may be challenging to hit the client’s savings target by focusing only on these purchases. But since raw materials and components represent about 40 percent of costs and there is an opportunity to concentrate purchasing, I think we should start here.\nInterviewer: Where else could you look for savings?\nCandidate: If I look back at the cost data on the jet, direct labor is another large cost component. As a contingency, we could look into that area as well. I’ve read that other companies use outsourcing to lower their manufacturing costs梡erhaps our client could do the same.\nFor example, it might want to increase its use of purchased subassemblies and reduce the amount of direct manufacturing it does. Of course this would work only if it could drive direct labor costs below the offsetting cost of these subassemblies. The client will be working closely with the subassembly suppliers to implement its purchasing initiative. This may give it an opportunity to explore the suppliers’ capabilities at the same time.\nInterviewer: That’s an interesting suggestion. How would you recommend the company pursue both of the initiatives you have discussed?\nCandidate: I would look first to combine purchases across the subassembly suppliers with our client’s purchases. I suspect that the client and the subassembly suppliers will need to share a great deal of information, including engineering drawings and specifications, with potential suppliers of the raw materials and components.\nThe Internet could prove to be a very effective medium for forming a single “virtual” purchasing department to consolidate both the flow of information and purchase orders across the companies. Our client might also want to use a bidding system for those materials that are true commodities.\nNext, I would turn to the engineering departments and form cross-company teams to look for areas to increase commonality of design. At the same time, those teams could explore opportunities to use more purchased subassemblies and decrease the client’s direct labor costs.\nInterviewer: That sounds great, and is very similar to a project we did. I would caution you, however, to examine the upfront costs involved in your recommendations, both for the redesign and for the implementation of the purchasing system, before going ahead.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: increase revenues.\nConsulting Firm: Boston Consulting Group (BCG) first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: healthcare: hospital & medical; software, information technology (IT).\nCase Interview Question #00911: Your client is GE Healthcare, the health care subsidiary of global conglomerate General Electric (NYSE: GE). Headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, United States, GE Healthcare produces a wide variety of medical instruments and related services, including medical imaging, medical diagnostics, patient monitoring systems, drug discovery, bio pharmaceutical manufacturing technologies and performance solutions services.\nFive years ago, GE Healthcare expanded into the health care software industry by purchasing IDX Systems Corporation, which markets administrative systems to large U.S. hospitals. These systems are designed primarily for back-office functions; they are not designed for managing patients or providing other physician and technical support. Since it was purchased, the software division has failed to deliver the growth needed to justify the multiple GE paid for it (USD $1.2 billion). GE Healthcare feels it has already squeezed margins as much as possible, and now is looking for new sales opportunities. IDX Systems turned to BCG to help identify potential ways to increase revenues. How would you approach this problem?\nPossible Answer:\n1. Establish understanding of the case\nCandidate: First, let me make sure I understand the problem. The parent company produces medical devices and services, but before the acquisition was not involved in health care software. The company it purchased, IDX Systems, sells only administrative systems software to large hospitals. It is now looking for opportunities to increase revenues.\nInterviewer: That is correct.\nCandidate: Could I take a moment to jot down a few thoughts?\nInterviewer: Sure, that would be fine.\n2. Set up the framework\nCandidate: I would suggest using the following framework:\nFirst, I’d want to understand the market size and growth rates for IDX Systems’ market and related software markets.\nNext, I would like to explore the competition and their market shares.\nThird, I would like to examine customer requirements and then, given those external conditions, look at the division’s capabilities to understand how well prepared it is to meet the needs of the marketplace.\nInterviewer: That sounds fine. So what do you want to know about the market?\n3. Evaluate the case using the framework\nCandidate: Well, the first hurdle would be to identify the markets the company would be interested in. Besides administration systems, what other types of medical software systems do large hospitals purchase?\nInterviewer: There are many software systems, but for the sake of time, the team focused on three primary markets: administration systems, patient administration, and physician support systems.\nCandidate: What do those systems do?\nInterviewer: Patient administration includes systems like admissions and tracking. Physician support systems are more specialized, for individual physician procedures.\nCandidate: I would like to know how large each market is and how fast each is growing. I would use secondary sources such as press releases, analyst reports, and published market studies, to obtain this information.\nInterviewer: Great! That is what we did during the market study. Our information revealed the following market sizes and growth rates.\n\n\n\nAdministration\nPatient administration\nPhysician support\n\n\nMarket size ($M)\n1,500\n1,000\n1,200\n\n\nGrowth rate\n5%\n5%\n12%\n\n\nCandidate: From a size and growth perspective, physician support systems looks like a very attractive market. I’d like to know a little about the customers themselves. The client is currently targeting large hospitals. Approximately what percentage of the market do they represent?\nInterviewer: We were unable to get an exact breakdown, but we know that these hospitals make up the vast majority of the total medical software market.\nCandidate: That would make sense, since the more sophisticated procedures at a hospital might necessitate more advanced software solutions. I know that there have been a lot of changes in the industry as a result of managed care. I don’t know much about the industry, so I would want to look at market studies and press clippings to get a better sense of the hospital market in general and any technology or software trends more specifically.\nInterviewer: Okay. Let’s say that you did that and were presented with this summary of market trends:\n• Consolidation in the industry, with three to four large hospital networks dominating 45 percent of the market\n• Cost controls instituted, particularly as these large hospital networks acquire smaller hospitals (centralization of functions being a key cost issue)\n• Many hospitals seeking to consolidate their vendor base\n• With regard to technology, many hospitals upgrading their older systems\nCandidate: If hospitals are consolidating vendors, perhaps our client has an advantage in being part of a larger medical company. Maybe the client could also gain some advantages by expanding into other software segments. Are the people responsible for purchasing software at the hospital the same for all three segments?\nInterviewer: Like all things, it differs by hospital, but the larger hospital networks, have tried to consolidate their purchasing not only within but also across hospitals.\nCandidate: Is the decision maker for medical software the same as for medical instrumentation and devices?\nInterviewer: In some cases, the head of purchasing influences both decisions, but the person who makes the final choice is different. Software decisions are usually made by the hospital IT function, and those for instrumentation by the medical staff.\nCandidate: I think I have a pretty good understanding of the market for now. Let’s look at competition next. We could identify all the competitors and build up the market shares using a combination of public data and estimates.\nInterviewer: Well, let’s assume that you don’t have an infinite amount of time to look at all the competitors. You can only look at the top five competitors in each market. You are given the following data:\n\n\nAdministration Systems\nSales ($M)\nGrowth (%)\n\n\nIDX Systems\n700\n4%\n\n\nHCS Software Systems\n100\n7%\n\n\nMorningside Software\n80\n3%\n\n\nAdmin Systems Solutions\n70\n2%\n\n\nHTI Software\n50\n15%\n\n\n\n\nPatient Administration\nSales ($M)\nGrowth (%)\n\n\nHTI\n300\n5%\n\n\nRegistration Software Solutions\n240\n4%\n\n\nSignup Software\n60\n3%\n\n\nHCS Software Systems\n30\n16%\n\n\nPatient Software\n20\n-1%\n\n\n\n\nPhysician Support\nSales ($M)\nGrowth (%)\n\n\nHCS Software Systems\n150\n16%\n\n\nPhysician Support Systems\n100\n11%\n\n\nMedical Technology Inc.\n25\n18%\n\n\nHTI\n20\n32%\n\n\nMedSys\n5\n15%\n\n\nCandidate: Very interesting. The first thing I would note from the data is that the market concentrations are very different. In administrative systems, the top five competitors control 66 percent of the market and in patient administration, they control 65 percent. But in the physician support market, they control only 25 percent.\nI would want to know what gross margins look like in each of these markets as well. I might turn to analyst reports and look at competitors’ financial statements to deduce whether they are making money in each market.\nInterviewer: Gross margins vary, of course, but the analyst reports have margins of 25 to 30 percent for administrative systems and for patient administration. For physician support, the margins tend to be higher, more like 45 to 50 percent.\nCandidate: I see that two competitors, HTI and HCS Software Systems, have very large revenue growth in all three sectors, although they each dominate one. I would want to look at their financials, annual reports, and press releases to find out a bit more about their strategy in each of these areas.\nInterviewer: You’d find that they recently entered these noncore markets. Why might they have done that?\nCandidate: Perhaps, like our client, each had a strong position in its own segment, HTI in patient administration and HCS Software Systems in physician support. Maybe they too decided to branch out into the other segments to find additional growth.\nInterviewer: That is a very good hypothesis. Let’s say there is evidence in the sources you consult that supports your assertion.\nCandidate: Well, if that were true, these two companies could be a threat not only in the other two segments, but also in our client’s segment, administrative systems. It looks as if the client is slowly losing market share in its segment, since it is growing more slowly than its market.\nInterviewer: Good observation.\nCandidate: The market and competitor trends could also suggest that the client may want to enter these other markets. In particular, the physician support market looks attractive, given it has high growth and lack of a dominant competitor. The higher gross margins may provide attractive returns on the necessary investment in software development.\nHowever, the patient administration market may also be attractive. Although it is more concentrated and offers lower margins than physician support, the client may be able to enter this segment with a smaller up-front investment. Given the trend toward upgrading existing computer systems, it may be important for IDX Systems to have a product offering in each of the three market segments. That should not be too difficult, since the company is already in the software industry.\nInterviewer: Perhaps, but you should think a little more closely about these types of software. Are all software systems alike?\nCandidate: Well, let me think about that for a moment. I suspect patient administration would have relatively low entry barriers. From your earlier description, these systems appear to be pretty basic, dealing primarily with admissions and patient tracking. However, the entry barriers in physician support might be higher, since these systems are more complex and there are probably multiple systems for the various physician procedures. I guess it would be harder to get into those types of systems.\nInterviewer: That would make sense.\nCandidate: Since the company might want to go into only some of the segments, I would want to know how important it is to have products in all three segments. Do we know if the competitors are marketing their products as a bundle?\nInterviewer: How might you find that out?\nCandidate: Since it would be difficult to talk to a competitor directly, I would probably target a competitor’s customer, particularly one that just converted from our client’s software.\nInterviewer: Let’s say you get an interview with a customer that recently switched to HTI. You discover that the competitor was offering it a better pricing deal and service for software products in all three segments.\nCandidate: How were IDX Systems’ software and service perceived in relation to those of competitors?\nInterviewer: The customer thought that its administrative systems were adequate, “the old standby,” but not stellar.\nCandidate: Were there any other key reasons it switched from IDX’s system?\nInterviewer: When it decided to upgrade its systems, it tried to contact IDX Systems, but could never get a representative to describe its options.\nCandidate: Interesting. How did HTI perform?\nInterviewer: The HTI representative had heard that the company was considering switching software vendors and provided a sales representative to pitch HTI’s administrative product the next day.\nCandidate: It definitely sounds as if there was a problem with the sales function and that customer relations need to be improved, particularly for the larger hospital chains. There also seems to be an advantage from both a marketing and sales perspective in having multiple software products. I would want to confirm those views by doing further interviews.\nInterviewer: Let’s say further interviews support those assumptions.\nCandidate: Since we have already looked at the external conditions, I would like to move on to the client itself. I’d like to know more about its marketing and selling organization as well as its software development skills.\nSo far, we know that our client offers administrative software and that there may be a problem with sales and marketing. Could you tell me a little about the marketing department?\nInterviewer: The marketing department is organized regionally. Teams are assigned to hospitals within each state or geographic region, such as New England.\nCandidate: That could explain some of the problems with IDX Systems’ marketing and sales. If hospital purchasing is centralized, the marketing organization may be outdated. Does the company have any teams dedicated to the four or five biggest hospital networks?\nInterviewer: No, there are no dedicated teams. They talked about doing that for a while, but it conflicted with the regional structure it had in place.\nCandidate: With regard to software, does the company feel it has any strengths or weaknesses?\nInterviewer: It feels that their administrative product is very strong (“best of breed”) and is the dominant technology. Also, the product is modular in design, which allows for easier upgrades. Although the company has never branched out into other market segments, the software developers believe that certain modules could be used to build the foundation for other administrative software programs. The company feels customer support is also an area in which it excels.\n4. Summarize and make recommendations\nCandidate: Let’s start with our client’s market. The client dominates the administrative software market, which is fairly large but growing slowly, and the company appears to be slowly losing market share. Patient administration is also growing relatively slowly.\nInterviewer: Both markets are relatively concentrated and appear to offer lower margins than physician support. The physician support market is large and less concentrated, and could potentially provide higher margins, but would require a larger investment. The hospital market itself is becoming more concentrated and is pushing to consolidate vendors. The purchasing agent is often the same for the three types of software.\nCandidate: Looking at our client’s competitors, two, HTI and HCS Software Systems, appear to be particularly threatening. Each has a dominant position in one segment and is branching out into other areas. They appear to be marketing their products and services as a bundle and are using service as a key point of differentiation.\nThe client offers only one type of system and appears to have some weaknesses in its marketing organization, particularly in marketing to the larger hospital networks, which offer the most promising market opportunities.\nInterviewer: How would you recommend proceeding?\nCandidate: The first priority should be to fix the marketing organization, particularly for the large hospital networks. IDX Systems will have trouble expanding into new markets if it can’t defend its current position and shore up its existing customer relationships. There should be a team dedicated to each of the major chains. The client should also look at improving customer tracking so that it is clear when its customers are going to upgrade. There should also be clear contacts so that the customer can easily keep in touch with IDX Systems.\nNext, I would recommend that the client explore entering the other market segments by leveraging its dominant position in administrative systems. At first glance, patient administration does not appear to be very attractive, with slow growth, low margins, and large, dominant competitors. There appears to be some advantage, however, in having products across the product range. I would recommend that we interview some of IDX Systems’ existing customers to better understand their needs and future IT requirements. If the customer base is interested in one software provider for both back-office administration and patient administration functions, this segment looks promising.\nIf the client does decide to enter this market, it should look at the lowest-cost method of entry, either developing a product internally or acquiring a competitor. The modular design of its existing administrative software suggests internal development of the patient administration product may be the way to go, but we would need a more thorough comparison of the internal development and acquisition options, including both cost and time to market. I think that physician support offers our client an exciting growth opportunity, given its high margins, high growth, and fragmented competition. I would definitely think about an acquisition strategy, since the client may lack the technical capabilities to enter this specialized market. I would recommend going for one of the larger companies, as that would give the client a stronger position. Smaller companies would probably not offer an important enough position in the market. More research would be needed, however, for us to better understand the intricacies of the market and each potential acquisition.\nInterviewer: Those are very interesting conclusions. Thank you.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Main question to address: Should plastics manufacturer move production to China?\n2. Key areas to explore\nA. Cost savings\nCosts in US = $1.00/lb.\nCosts in China = (labor) $0.30 * 8%/80% + (plastic resin) $0.30 * 80% + (other material) $0.20 * 75% + (variable overhead) $0.05 * 140% + (fixed overhead) $0.10 * 60% + (transportation) $6,000/40,000 + $0.05 = $0.03 + $0.24 + $0.15 + $0.07 + $0.06 + $0.15 + $0.05 = $0.75/lb.\n• Would save $0.25/lb. (25% of current costs)\n• At current production levels, would save:\n- $0.25 * 200M = $50M in freezer bags\n- $0.25 * 300M = $75M in plastic plates and utensils\n- $0.25 * 100M = $25M in specialty plates and utensils\nB. Consumer behavior and purchase criteria\n• Quality is top purchase criteria for freezer bags – lower quality from China\n• Price is top criteria for plastic plates and utensils\n• Style is top criteria for specialty plates and utensils – highly variable demand requires short lead times\nC. Effect on current production capabilities\n• Current plant is at capacity – outsourcing would eliminate need to build additional capacity\n• Plastic plates and utensils are 50% of total production – outsourcing may create too much extra capacity\n3. Recommendation\n• Outsource plastic plates and utensils to China.\n• Do not outsource specialty plates and utensils.\n• Do not outsource freezer bags (although further analysis may be warranted).\n4. Other factors\n• To compensate for extra capacity that would be created in current plant, the client could produce new product line, rent out spare capacity, or move to smaller facility.\n5. Detailed Analysis\nThe interviewee should start with a brief overview of the potential benefits and risks of outsourcing to China. The main benefit is lower costs, mostly driven by inexpensive labor. A secondary benefit is a possible springboard into the emerging Chinese (and other Asian) market. Risks include lower labor productivity, possible quality issues, longer lead times, additional transportation costs, and potential communication/coordination issues. Ask the interviewee about the ramifications of longer lead times – they include greater carrying costs, higher cycle and safety stock, greater forecast error, and less responsiveness to demand.\nThere are three main questions that the interviewee needs to answer:\n• How much cheaper is producing in China?\n• What do consumers value and how would outsourcing affect those criteria?\n• What are the client’s current production capabilities and how would outsourcing part/all of their production affect the remainder?\nFirst, the interviewee should size the opportunity – is this a $5 million or $500 million opportunity? By solving for the last column in Exhibit 1, the interviewee will find that the client would save $0.25/lb. (25% of current costs) by outsourcing to China. Given current production levels, the client would save $50 million by outsourcing freezer bags, $75 million by outsourcing plastic plates and utensils, and $25 million by outsourcing specialty plates and utensils. Two notes: (1) costs may increase if the Chinese Yuan rises versus the dollar and (2) these estimates do not include a profit margin for the Chinese outsourcing partner.\nThe interviewee must recognize, however, that cost savings alone are not sufficient to make a decision. It is important to understand how an outsourced product will affect sales. The interviewee should suggest market research to understand consumer behavior.\nFreezer bags: since customers’ top purchase criteria is quality and outsourcing would produce lower quality bags, the interviewee should raise a red flag here. A more sophisticated recommendation would be to conduct market research to see the impact on sales of the lower quality bag at lower prices – even though quality is more important than price, the magnitude of a price change may override the drop in product quality.\nPlastic plates and utensils: the top purchase criteria here is price, which makes this product line an attractive outsourcing opportunity. Ask the interviewee what the client should do with the cost savings – potential recommendations include dropping price to steal share, investing to defend its position in case competitors begin outsourcing (e.g., brand, innovation, customer service), and milking the product line as a cash cow.\nSpecialty plates and utensils: the highly variable and unpredictable demand for these products means that shorter lead times are critical in order to adjust production quickly. Longer lead times will result in greater forecast errors, higher safety/cycle stock, and more unsold inventory and/or out-of-stocks. Therefore, specialty plates and utensils should not be outsourced.\nAn analysis of customer purchase behavior indicates that plastic plates and utensils should be outsourced, specialty plates and utensils should not be, and freezer bags probably should not be. The final step is to understand the impact of outsourcing on the client’s current production capabilities. For example, will it lead to plant closings (resulting in closing costs and possible negative publicity)? Will it lead to underutilization of current facilities?\nSince the current plant is already near capacity, moving plastic plates and utensils offshore would actually save the client from investing in new facilities. However, since that product line makes up 50% of total production (in terms of lbs.), removing it may create too much extra capacity in the current plant for the two remaining lines. To compensate, the client could produce a new product line, rent out the extra capacity, or move to a smaller plant.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The company’s main line of business is self-adhesive sheeted papers that are ultimately used in a variety of labeling applications – including the labeling of consumer goods and the printing of self-adhesive signs. The company is headquartered in Glendale, California, with operates in more than 50 countries.\nCurrently the client Avery Dennison’s operations are profitable, but the business has failed to deliver any growth over the past few years. The client would like to invest additional capital in the business and you have been asked to identify opportunities for growth. How would you go about it?\nAdditional Information: to share with interviewee upon request\n1. Supply chain \nRaw materials –> Layering –> Sheeting –> Packaging –> Distribution\nRaw materials: Rolls of paper, Adhesive, Non-stick liner\nLayering: Adhesive and liner applied to rolls\nSheeting: Rolls of layered paper cut into sheets\n• The client is not capacity constrained in its manufacturing processes.\n• The client’s manufacturing and packaging operations are currently configured to package specialty papers in boxes.\n2. Customers\n• There are approximately 24,000 commercial printers in the United States.\n• Commercial printers are roughly categorized into three groups: small, medium, and large.\n• Differences among the groups are driven by the type of printing technology employed and the size of print jobs that the printers are able to serve.\n• Printers prefer to receive product from the specialty paper manufacturers in different forms, primarily driven by the type of printing technology employed.\n- Small printers prefer to receive their specialty paper in boxes\n- Medium printers prefer cartons of specialty paper\n- Large printers prefer to receive palletized shipments of specialty paper\n3. Market share\n• The client has approximately 30% market share with small printers and only 10% share with medium and large printers.\n4. Client financials\n• Margins are currently acceptable but management is against cutting price to gain market share, knowing that competitors can match price cuts.\n• Price and cost to serve per equivalent box are different for each customer type.\nExhibit 1.

Investment can take many forms including expansion of manufacturing operations and capacity, expansion of customer-facing activities, and acquisition of competitors. It’s interesting to note that this is currently a profitable, no-growth business for the client. Investment decisions cannot be made unless the management team (and the interviewee) understand the market conditions as well as the client’s internal capabilities.\nThis case does not lend itself well to traditional “case solution structures”. A strong initial response is to list a set of internal and external factors that must be understood and evaluated. Ultimately, the interviewee should decide whether investment is warranted, and if so, where.\nStrong hypotheses might include:\n• Assuming the client is not capacity constrained, there are likely groups of customers that represent opportunities for profitable growth.\n• Depending upon the current go-to-market strategy, the client may need to re-evaluate the way that it is configured to serve existing and potential customers.\nAssume the client can expand their packaging operations to better serve medium or large customers, but not both.\nThe interviewee should recognize that a comprehensive solution evaluates the required investment to serve a particular market segment (packaging line, manufacturing operations, additional SG&A) against the expected return.\n• For simplicity, the interviewee should ignore taxes and depreciation, assume SG&A is fixed.\nClient economics and cost to serve each customer group are shown on Exhibit 1.\nThe interviewee should evaluate the profit pool from serving medium and large customers. This should be based upon an assumption about the size of the market that the client can capture. Assuming the client can match its small printer market share, the client could capture an additional 20% of the medium or the large printer customer segment.\nAssume the following (and reveal to interviewee when asked):\n• Investment and operation of carton packaging line would cost $675,000 per year\n• Investment and operation of the palletizing line would cost $2,300,000 per year\nRecommendation\nA logical conclusion would be that an investment in a carton packaging line would be a superior investment compared to the palletizing line.\nA strong answer may also include following:\n• The carton packaging line is a less-risky investment (requires less up-front capital).\n• The solution assumes a static environment. If large printers are growing in number and or usage of specialty paper, this may change the answer.\n• The investment in a new carton packaging line would need to be evaluated against other potential investments to understand if it is the optimal use of the client’s capital.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: operations strategy, optimization; organizational behavior.\nConsulting Firm: PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Advisory first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: health & life insurance.\nCase Interview Question #00899: Our client American Family Insurance (aka AmFam) is a private insurance company that focuses on property, casualty and auto insurance, but also offers commercial insurance, life, health, and homeowners coverage, as well as investment and retirement-planning products. A Fortune 500 company, its revenues for 2008 were over $6.7 billion.\nThe year is 2009. In 2007 (two years ago), we helped the client develop their strategic plan, which would govern the direction of the company over the next five years. The client has explained the strategy to the individual business units, and asked the units to submit ideas for new initiatives that would support the strategy. The business units have submitted approximately 80 initiatives all together. It is now 2009 and the economy is in a recession. Due to the increased uncertainty in the market and the difficulty in accessing capital, our client will have to be more selective with the initiatives that it selects to move forward. The client has hired our firm to help them develop the criteria and methodology to enable them to prioritize the initiatives so that they can move forward with implementation as soon as possible. How would you go about it?\nPossible Answer:\nPart 1: Case Facts\nBehind the Scenes: Let the candidate layout a framework and brainstorm what criteria he/she would consider in developing a prioritization schedule. Ideas might include: strategic fit, financial value, ease of implementation (i.e. low hanging fruit), growth opportunities etc.\nThe interviewer should reveal the following case information when asked a relevant question:\nThe strategic plan included 3 main goals for the insurance company:\n1. Increasing scale of the business\na. Increasing sales volume of insurance plans.\nb. Improving the efficiency of the administrative functions and overall organization enabling them to handle larger workloads.\n2. Increasing customer involvement in insurance plan selection\na. Creating programs/tools to enable customers to take more ownership of plan selection (note: this is industry trend that our client doesn’t want to be left behind).\n3. Rebuilding the brand\na. Our client is viewed as a traditional brand, and they would like to unveil themselves as a 21st century healthcare insurance provider.\nb. Attract more new customers.\n• All three of these goals are equally important.\n• An initiative can support more than one goal.\n• The client wants diversification within all the initiatives chosen, so that there will be an equal distribution of initiatives supporting the three goals.\n• Due to the difficult economic situation, it is important to the client to see results/impact of initiatives as quickly as possible.\n• There is a steering committee that understands the work of the individual business units and will impartially evaluate the effectiveness of each initiative in addressing the strategic goals.\n• The company prides itself on being very data driven and is looking for as quantitative a measure as possible.\nPart 2: Developing a Ranking System\nInterviewer: So, the steering committee has gone ahead and ranked the initiatives based on their fit with the strategic goals. Exhibit A below represents a sample ranking as determined by the committee, with only 4 initiatives (instead of all 80) and 2 goals (instead of all 3). The ranking applies a higher number to a better fit with the goal (e.g. rank of 4 denotes best fit with particular goal; rank of 1 denotes poorest fit with particular goal).\nExhibit A:\n\n\n\n\nRank\n\n\n\nInitiative\nGoal 1\nGoal 2\n\n\nA\n1\nN/A\n\n\nB\n2\nN/A\n\n\nC\n3\n2\n\n\nD\n4\n1\n\n\n\nPossible Answer:\nThe candidate should suggest that a weighted average of the ranks be taken to derive an overall score. Because all of the goals are equally important, the weighting should take a 50% – 50% split between the two goals. If an initiative doesn’t address a goal (as in the two N/A’s), that rank should be considered 0.\nKey Insight: Since the ranking system assigns the highest number to the project with the best fit with a particular goal, the ranks for Goal 2 need to be equalized with Goal 1. In this case, the “2″ and “1″ for Goal 2 need to become “4″ and “3″ respectively.\nAfter taking the weighted average, options “C” and “D” tie at 3.5, suggesting the requirement for further analysis in order to prioritize the initiatives. The chart below summarizes the scores (don’t show this chart to candidate).\n\n\n\n\n\nRank\n\n\n\n\nInitiative\nGoal 1\nGoal 2\nAdjusted Goal 2\nOverall Score\n\n\nA\n1\nN/A\n0\n0.5\n\n\nB\n2\nN/A\n0\n1\n\n\nC\n3\n2\n4\n3.5\n\n\nD\n4\n1\n3\n3.5\n\n\n\nPart 3: Financial Analysis\nInterviewer: So, since two initiatives can tie under this ranking system, what would you do next?\nBehind the Scenes: If the candidate does not suggest looking at the financial attractiveness of each initiative, then the interviewer should encourage them in this direction.\nInterviewer: How would you assess the financial attractiveness of the initiatives?\nPossible Answers:\nThe candidate may suggest looking at the payback period, IRR (internal rate of return), and NPV (net present value) evaluations. However, due to the tenuous economic situation in 2009, the candidate should primarily suggest a payback period analysis as the leading financial indicator of the attractiveness of each initiative. This analysis could be supplemented with an NPV and/or IRR analysis to understand the magnitude (NPV) and effectiveness/efficiency (IRR) of the investment.\nPart 4: Prioritizing the Initiatives\nInterviewer: Now that you understand the client’s needs and their ranking methodology, we need to prioritize the list of initiatives. The client’s primary concern is the fit of the initiative with their strategic goals, followed closely by the financial impact of the initiative. Given this information, how would you structure the prioritization plan that we will propose to them for all 80 of their initiatives?\nPossible Answers:\nThe candidate can be creative in developing their methodology, but should consider the key areas of importance to the client (strategic fit with goals, then financials) and develop a structure that is logical, straightforward and intuitive (i.e. not introducing unnecessary levels of complication to the model).\nFor example, the candidate could move towards stratifying the initiatives into groups. Those initiatives that address all three goals would be in Tier 1, those that address two goals in tier 2, and so on. From there, some combination of the weighted average of the project’s overall rank and payback period or other financial analysis can lead to further stratification within each tier.\nPart 5: Recommendation\nInterviewer: So, you’re heading into a meeting with the steering committee to present your recommendations for their project investing methodology project. What do you tell them?\nPossible Answers:\nThe candidate should succinctly summarize the methodology that was developed and the criteria that were considered. The candidate should also mention other qualitative considerations that should be taken into account for initiative selection (e.g. synergies between initiatives that may reduce their costs or increase value, political issues of initiative selection between units, bread/diversification of initiatives, competitor responses, etc). The final methodology should be the result of a combination of quantitative analysis and broader managerial thinking.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new product; add capacity, expansion; math problem.\nConsulting Firm: McKinsey & Company 2nd round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: manufacturing; sports, leisure & recreation.\nCase Interview Question #00901: Our client is Mr. Barney Adams, the CEO of a family owned business called Adams Golf Inc (AGI). Adams Golf is an American golf club manufacturing company based in Plano, Texas, United States that designs, manufactures, markets and sells golf equipment and golf accessories. Many tour professional have endorsement deals for Adams Golf and are contracted to use their equipment.\nAdams Golf used to produce golf clubs that were easy to use, so most of their customers are beginner players. They recently received a patent from the United States Patent and Trademark Office for a new club that would enhance the performance of amateurs and professionals alike. Product innovation is paramount in the golf club manufacturing industry and they want help capitalizing on this development with a strong product launch. How would you go about it?\nPossible Answer:\nNote to Interviewer: If the interviewee asks for time to come up with a structure, ask them to wait until they hear the specific questions first.\nPart 1: Analyzing the market \nBehind the scenes: Start by showing the chart. Give the candidate 20 seconds, then wait for insights. If the candidate doesn’t answer questions (1) and (2) by then, push for it.\nInterviewer: There are two main ways to produce golf clubs: liquid and solid production. Adams Golf currently use liquid production only, but some competitors use solid production. The chart below represents the number of golf club sets sold in each year. The current year is 2009. We have historical data from 2007 and 2008, and estimates for 2009 and the next two years. What do you see?\n\n(1) What do you think of this market?\n(2) Does being one of the top producers matter? Why do you think so?\nPossible Answers:\n(1) The market has been growing rapidly: more than 100% in two years; it is definitely attractive.\n(2) The top 10 liquid producers have a huge market share, so being top is clearly important. Some\npossible reasons are:\n(a) It’s easier to invest in product innovation.\n(b) There are economies of scale in production, distribution and advertising.\nPart 2: Should we build a new plant or expand ours?\nBehind the scenes: You can give all information at once, rather than waiting for questions. The intent is to give all information quickly and let the candidate work with it.\nInterviewer: We estimate that the annual demand for our new club to be 60,000 sets over the next few years. Given the information below, do you think we should build a new, additional plant or expand the current plant? (All machines are equally durable.)\nA. Building a new, additional plant:\n• Initial one-time investment of $2M.\n• Two types of machines are available:\n• Machine line I: 2,000 sets / month, costs $12.5M\n• Machine line II: 1,250 sets /month, costs $8M\n• Restriction: Can only have a total of 3 lines operating there.\nB. Expanding the current plant:\n• Initial one-time investment of $2M.\n• Two types of machines are available:\n• Machine line I: 1,250 sets / month, costs $8M\n• Machine line II: 7,500 sets/ year, costs $5.5M\n• All machines last for exactly the same time.\nPossible Answer:\nOK, let’s compare the total costs in each case. The one-time investment is the same in either case so we can ignore it when comparing. Because the demand for the new club is 60,000 sets per year, production line should have a capacity of at least 5,000 sets per month.\nA. For building a new plant:\nThe new plant can only have a total of 3 machine lines operating, therefore, there are two possible alternatives: (1) two type I machines + one type II machine, monthly production = 2,000*2 + 1,250 = 5,250 sets, or (2) three type I machines, monthly production = 2,000*3 = 6,000 sets.\nScenario (1):\n• Costs = $12.5*2 + $8 = $33M\n• Production = 5,250 * 12 months = 63,000 sets per year\nScenario (2):\n• Costs = $12.5*3 = $37.5M\n• Production = 6,000 * 12 months = 72,000 sets per year\nWe conclude that it would be optimal to have two type I and one type II machine, for a total cost of $33M and total production of 63K sets.\nB. For expanding the existing plant:\nIt’s useful to notice that 1,250 / month = 15,000 per year, thus type I machine is much less expensive than type II. With 4 type I machines, we produce exactly 4 * 1,250 * 12 = 60,000 sets per year, for a total cost of 4 * $8 = $32M.\nConclusion: Costs are roughly the same ($33M vs. $32M, the extra million for a new plant could be offset by future capacity needs), so we need to include further considerations to decide what to do.\nPart 3: Other issues in deciding which project to pursue\nBehind the scenes: This is a brainstorm session. Keep asking the candidate “what else” to get the most of the candidate. If candidate runs out of ideas, you can help by saying “what about…? how do you think that impacts the decision?”, but that clearly hurts candidate’s overall performance in the case.\nInterviewer: Given that the calculated costs are roughly the same, what other issues would you want to analyze? What are the pros & cons of each of them? Which would you choose?\nPossible Answers:\n• Management/Admin: Lower labor and G&A (general and administrative) costs if you only have one plant.\n• Product quality: easier to have a standard if you only have one plant.\n• Distribution: might be cheaper if you can distribute from two different locations.\n• Event risks: insurance would be cheaper with 2 plants (diversifying event risk).\n• Capacity for future: new plant has higher capacity (63K vs. 60K, 3,000 club sets per year more)\n• Time to implement.\n• Impact of implementation on current production capacity for other club lines.\nPart 4: Possible problems\nBehind the scenes: This is, again, a brainstorm session. If the candidate is stuck, ask something like “have you ever remodeled your house? What were your main concerns?”.\nInterviewer: The CEO Mr. Barney Adams decided to expand the existing plant, and there are two main issues regarding the expansion project that don’t allow him to sleep at night. Assuming our market estimates are 100% right, what do you think these issues are?\nPossible Answer:\nTiming: We said product innovation is important and the market is quickly expanding, so it’s important to launch the product on time.\nCosts: It’s important to guarantee that construction costs won’t raise after he decides to go for the expansion project.\nInterviewer: (After the candidate answers the above) How could the CEO protect himself against it?)\nPossible Answer:\nThe CEO could protect himself by buying an insurance policy.\nPart 5: Insurance Price\nBehind the scenes: There is more than one way to come up with a price, so guide the interviewee to calculate it through the data we provide.\nIf the candidate asks whether he/she could simplify the calculations, the answer is no. If the candidate miss the last point and say instead that the answer is 660, 000, ask him/her whether he/she is sure about that before ending the interview.\nInterviewer: What do you think the insurance price will be? What information do you need in order to calculate that?\n(after the answer): What would the price be if you assume the following:\n• Adams Golf has contracts to sell 60,000 sets for $500 each.\n• If Adams Golf can’t produce more than 90% of the 60,000 in the next eight months, they lose 10% of the contracts. This happens with a probability of 20%.\n• If Adams Golf produce 90% or more in the next eight months, they don’t lose anything.\n• The insurer operates with 10% margin.\nPossible Answer:\nFrom the insurer perspective: with 80% probability they have zero loss, and with probability 20% they have a loss of 10% * 60,000 * $500 = $3M.\nTherefore, the expected expense is 20% * $3M = $600,000\nSince they operate with 10% margin, this expense should represent 90% of their price.\nTherefore, the price charged is $600,000 / 0.90 = $666,667.\nPart 6: Wrap-up\nNote: There is no need to do a wrap-up in this case, but it doesn’t hurt if the candidate proactively comes up with a conclusion/summary.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

They have asked us to determine whether or not they should launch the new product, if yes, how to do it, and what the marketing strategy should be.\nPossible Answer:\nPart 1: Background\nSparkling water, also known as club soda, soda water, or carbonated water, is water into which carbon dioxide gas under pressure has been dissolved.\nInterviewer: Let the Candidate ask questions from their structure, but make sure that they ask some variation of the following questions about the beverage market, and give these answers.\nWhat is the size of the entire water market in the United States? Answer is: 8 million gallons sold per year.\nSpecifically, what is the breakdown in the water market, and what percentage of sales are in sparkling versus non-sparkling? The interviewer should now provide the following two graphs (the second graph represents a further breakdown of the 10% non-sparkling water shown in the first graph: O2 Flavor and Easy Drink are flavored non-sparkling water products.\nExhibit 1. Breakdown of U.S. water market\n\nExhibit 2. Breakdown of U.S. non-sparkling water market\n\nThe Candidate should now volunteer some key insights, which should include:\n• Flavored non-sparkling water represents a small share of the overall market.\n• Only two competitors have large market shares in this market –> our client PepsiCo may have an opportunity to emerge as a third large competitor in this highly segmented market.\nHow will the drinks be packaged? Everyone packages their water in 16 oz bottles, and our client PepsiCo will do the same (this will be important for the market sizing).\nHow will the drink be priced? $1 per bottle.\nPart 2: Market Sizing\nInterviewer: Ask the Candidate to do a market sizing and then determine how long it would take to break even on this product.\nFirst, the Candidate should calculate the size of the flavored non-sparkling water market:\n• 10% of 8 million gallons = 800,000 gallons of flavored non-sparkling water sold each year.\n• Each bottle contains 16 oz; there are 64 oz in a gallon, then 4 bottles make a gallon.\n• 800,000 gallons * 4 bottles in a gallon = 3.2 million bottles sold each year in this market.\nPart 3: Break even analysis\nInterviewer: The next step is to figure out how long it will take to start making money on this product. Give the Candidate the following information on the margins: Costs = 90 cents per bottle\nKey Insight: The Candidate should see that since each bottle is sold for $1, the company makes 10 cents on each bottle.\nInterviewer: The product launch will cost $400,000. How many bottles the client PepsiCo will have to sell in order to break even?\nCandidate: $400,000 / 10 cents per bottle = 4 million bottles need to be sold\nKey Insight: The Candidate should see that 4 million bottles is larger than the entire annual market for such products (3.2 million), so it will take a few years to reach this amount (assuming not change in market size).\nInterviewer: So how many years will it take?\nCandidate: Looking back at the two graph, the Candidate should determine a reasonable market share goal or estimation that this product will grab. Here are some possible thought processes:\na. Since the new entrant PepsiCo is a major company, it should come in strong with brand name power.\nb. Since the other two main competitors have 12% and 18% market share, and our product is backed by a strong company, perhaps this product will come in somewhere in that range. (Any estimate that is backed by logical reasoning and reasonable assumptions is acceptable here.)\nc. Using 15% as an estimate, the calculations should look like this:\n• 15% of 3.2 million bottles = 480,000 bottles to sell each year = ~0.5 million\n• 4 million bottles / 0.5 million bottles = 8 –> it will take 8 years to break even\nAn excellent candidate would comment that 8 years is an “eternity” in a market like beverages (especially because new beverages emerge constantly and trends change).\nPart 4: Other marketing issues to consider\nInterviewer: Knowing this information, how should the client PepsiCo position the new product in the market?\nCandidate: Should ask for additional information on how the two main competitors are positioning their drinks. When he/she does, show the following chart.\n\nThe key takeaways from this chart are:\n• Our beverage will be in the “other” category and need to make a name for itself there.\n• Our client PepsiCo should position the new drink as a sports drink or leisure beverage, since those are the categories where “other” has the largest market share.\nInterviewer: Ask the candidate to brainstorm some problems with this new venture.\nPossible Answer:\n• Changes in the market landscape for beverages (perhaps flavored water is a fad?)\n• Product cannibalization (how many other similar products does this company make?)\nPart 5: Recommendation\nInterviewer: Ask the candidate to summarize his/her findings and make a final recommendation.\nPossible Answer:\nThis is probably a questionable investment. It will take some time to break even. However, if interest in this kind of product remains strong, and the client PepsiCo can leverage its existing strengths to get an immediately strong market share, this has potential for being a profitable product.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "title": "Andover to Switch from Direct Sales to Service Contract Model",
        "url": "http://www.consultingcase101.com/andover-to-switch-from-direct-sales-to-service-contract-model/",
        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: merger and acquisition (M&A); organizational behavior; industry analysis.\nConsulting Firm: McKinsey & Company final round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: oil, gas, petroleum industry; industrial equipment.\nCase Interview Question #00902: Our client is the CEO of Andover Compressor, a company that produces natural gas compressors. A compressor is used to pump gas out of a well, compress it, and move it to a pipeline. Andover is preparing to merge with Bellspan, a compressor company of approximately equal size, to form CompressCorp. Both companies produce similar products and both manufacture, sell, install, and service their compressors. The two companies are almost identical.\nInvestment bankers involved with the merger have assured Andover’s CEO that the merger will “create significant value”, and Andover Compressor’s CEO has hired McKinsey & Company to investigate how value will be created and what CompressCorp can do to best take advantage of the merger.\nWe have a meeting with the CEO tomorrow morning, and we want to be effective with his time, so what would you want to investigate to approach this case?\nPossible Answer:\nBehind the Scenes: The candidate should structure an approach to identify value creation opportunities. In general, the structure should address how the changes resulting from the merger can be leveraged to create a competitive advantage for the merged firm. A good structure might include:\n• Market – How will the merger create a better market position for the combined firm?\n• Company / Operations – Investigate how new revenue opportunities and/or cost savings will spur increasing profitability in the future.\n• Financial Strength – Will CompressCorp have easier access to capital due to the merger that will allow the company to expand more effectively?\nPart 1: Market Position Analysis\nInterviewer: (Encourage the candidate to look at market positioning first). From a market positioning standpoint, what are some possible benefits of the merger? What are some possible concerns?\nPossible Answers:\na. Benefits\n• Increased market power could allow combined firm to charge a higher price.\n• If geographies and/or customer segments are different, combined firm will have an expanded market with more product variety and channels.\n• More effective competitive position if combined firm’s technology is a market leader or their financial position is stronger.\n• Economies of scale advantage in U.S. market.\nb. Concerns\n• Ability to leverage market power to raise price could be restricted by anti-trust regulation and/or due to offering commodity type product.\n• Reduced competition may leave customers resentful as they have reduced options and feel trapped by ‘big player’\n• Reduced competition may stifle further drive for innovation.\n• Potential response by competitors in other markets (either geographic or product-based).\n• Impact on corporate identity/brand perception in the market.\n• Government/regulatory restrictions on new firm’s activities.\nBehind the Scenes: Anti-trust and customer responses to the merger are the primary concerns that the candidate should list. Share the following information with the candidate when he/she asks relevant/insightful questions:\nAdditional Information:\n• Lawyers have determined that the merger will go through but that CompressCorp will not be able to raise prices on customers based on anti-trust regulation.\n• Andover and Bellspan currently each have about 40% of the U.S. market (i.e. the combined firm CompressCorp will have about 80%).\n• International markets are much more fragmented, and both companies have small market shares in various locations globally.\n• Customers include both large oil and gas multinationals and small independent operators.\nInterviewer: I think this is a good list of benefits and concerns. Based on your market analysis, can you give me a few recommendations you would make to at our meeting with the CEO tomorrow?\nCandidate:\n• The merger will give us a dominant position in the U.S. market with 80% market share and we should first focus on integrating the companies and strengthening our U.S. position.\n• We will need to actively address the concerns of our U.S. customers about reduced competition in the market.\n• We should consider how the merger will relay into a new strengthened brand and positioning in the market.\n• We should look for opportunities to leverage our newfound scale in international markets in order to grow market share and seek to grow that business organically or through further acquisitions.\nPart 2: Customer Concerns\nInterviewer: Good. Let’s look a little bit more at the concerns of our customers. (If customers weren’t brought up in the earlier exercise, bring them up now. It is best if the candidate creates a “mini-structure” to identify customer concerns. He/she should also remember that our client offers services across the entire value chain).\nPossible Answers:\nCustomer concerns include:\n• Customers may be concerned that we will raise prices.\n• Customers may be concerned that we will try to service everyone with fewer resources and that service quality will suffer.\n• Assuming we will only offer one line of compressors, some customers will have to switch technologies and re-train their staffs.\n• Customer concerns about maintenance on discontinued models.\nInterviewer: Good. What would you do to address customers’ concerns?\nPossible Answers:\nCommunication is key! Since most of our customer base is comprised of the large oil and gas companies, we can communicate directly at the C-level. We should emphasize these points: We will not raise prices (given regulatory constraints this isn’t an option anyways) and we will offer the same level of service as before. We will also add more value by using the best technology and capabilities of both companies.\nPart 3: Company Operations and Synergies\nInterviewer: Let’s take a look at the companies now. How will the merger create value from an operational standpoint?\nBehind the Scenes: The candidate should structure their response. One option is to create a structure based on cost reductions and revenue opportunities. Another option is to consider value creation throughout the value chain.\nPossible Answer:\na. Revenue Growth (Should focus on Quantity)\n• Being the clear market leader (in U.S.) may attract additional customers.\n• Being market leader may give more flexibility in launching new, creative sales models/product types.\n• Any differences between the firms in their product portfolios (e.g. service packages, warranties, add-ons) could provide new cross-sell opportunities to the customers from other firm.\n• • Identify added value resulting from the combination of technologies and service capabilities.\nLeverage market leader position in U.S to build international market (gain access to multinational accounts).\n.\nb. Cost Reduction\n• Procurement: Increased purchasing power with suppliers.\n• Production: Shift production to less expensive plant / expand plants / improve asset utilization. Generally take advantage of economies of scale. Simplify product offering to discontinue less profitable products.\n• Sales: Lower sales and marketing cost by reducing sales force where clients or geographies overlap. Integrate customer relationship management processes.\n• Service: Servicing a reduced product line will be more efficient.\n• SG&A: Leaner management structure, eliminate redundancies and consolidate functions such as procurement, IT, HR, logistics, finance, etc.\nPart 4: Sales Model Analysis\nInterviewer: The CEO would like to simplify operations by focusing on one of three current sales models for CompressCorp’s machines. Take a look at this sales data and tell me what method should be pursued? (Show Exhibit A, and let the candidate keep it.)\nExhibit A: Sales Methods for Andover and Bellspan\n\n\n\n\nAndover Revenues\nBellspan Revenues\nMargin\n\n\nDirect Sales: Customers buy a compressor and operate it themselves. They also provide maintenance in house.\n$700M\n$400M\n30%\n\n\nLeases: Customers lease the equipment and pay for a service package.\n$75M\n$50M\n15%\n\n\nService Contract: Customers sign a service agreement and the company handles all operations needed to get gas from the well to the pipeline.\n$425M\n$600M\n40%\n\n\n\n$1200M\n$1,050M\n\n\n\n\nKey Insight: Since “Service Contract” is the highest margin method, CompressCorp should clearly focus on this type of sale. CompressCorp also needs to exit its leasing business quickly, since the margins are significantly less attractive.\nInterviewer: Let’s say that at our meeting with the CEO we suggest moving to the Service Contract sales model and he responds that he thinks we should pursue Direct Sales instead because the Direct Sales method will improve CompressCorp’s Return on Assets (ROA). The CEO’s justification is that selling the compressors will result in lower assets on the balance sheet and more income, which will in turn increase ROA. The CFO responds that the Service Contract creates more value, which is more important than ROA in the long run. What would your input be into this discussion?\nBehind the Scenes: The candidate needs to give a confident answer and ultimately should stick to the initial answer of the higher margin method.\nCandidate: Even though the ROA may be lower under the Service Contract model, it will create more value for CompressCorp in the long run which is the more important metric. We could also look at other relevant ratios such as the leverage or the current ratio, which would be improved by focusing on Service Contract sales (extra points for this last insight!)\nInterviewer: That seems like a good answer, but the CEO says he needs some numbers to be convinced. What would you need to show him which method is more valuable to CompressCorp?\nCandidate: We can use the information we have to determine the value created by each type of sale and then compare amongst them. Let’s try to see what profits each method generates for CompressCorp.\nInterviewer: Good. How would you value each option? What information would you need? (Offer the following information as the candidate works through the problem and asks for it).\nAdditional Information:\n• A Direct Sale generates $1M in revenue.\n• A Service Contract generates $300,000 in annual revenue.\n• Service Contracts are very long term (should use a perpetuity)\n• Margins can be used from the previously revealed Exhibit A. (The candidate should get this on his/her own.)\n• Assume a discount rate of 10%.\nCandidate: We need to compare the profit generated from each type of sale to see which creates more value.\na. Direct Sales: Can be calculated using the 30% margin and a sale price.\nProfits = 0.3 * $1,000,000 = $300,000\nb. Service Contract: This is a long-term agreement, so we should do a NPV (net present value) calculation to compare\nit to the Direct Sales method. We’ll need to know the cost of producing a compressor (initial investment), the annual profits from the service contract and the length of the contract.\n• Since the margin on a $1M direct sale is 30%, we can infer the cost is 70%. Cost = 0.7 * $1,000,000 = $700,000\n• Annual Profit: Can be calculated using the $300,000 annual revenue and a 40% margin. Annual Profit = 0.4 * $300,000 = $120,000\n• Present value for a perpetuity = Annual Profit/discount rate = $120,000 / 0.10 = $1,200,000\n• Subtract cost of compressor from discounted profit to get profit value today. Profit = $1.2M – $0.7M = $500,000\nWe can see that the Service Contract is significantly more profitable ($500K vs. $300K, 66% more profitable) than Direct Sales, and these numbers should allow us to make a more affective argument to the CEO.\nInterviewer: OK. So what would you do if a customer wasn’t interested in a Service Contract and only wanted to buy a compressor?\nPossible Answers:\nThis depends on our relationship with the customer and whether or not we are at capacity. In general, we wouldn’t want to walk away from a 30% margin when faced with no other option. Transitioning to a Service Contract might be a long-term effort with each client. Angles to consider:\n• If we are not at capacity, then we should sell the excess compressors directly while considering the effect and perception by other customers.\n• If we are at capacity, and the customer is a small or infrequent buyer, then we should either not sell them the unit or charge $1.2M for the sale (in order to receive the same $500K profit that we would have received under the Service Contract model).\n• If we are at capacity and the customer is a large, high volume buyer like Exxon, then we will have to consider the customer relationship more closely in decided to sell them the  compressor. We may not be able to afford to lose this business, and, in the long run, selling many compressors to this client will likely be more profitable than servicing fewer compressors to other clients.\nPart 5. Recommendations\nNo formal recommendation is necessary in this case, but if the candidate offers one it should be concise and well-structured.\nHere’s one good sample recommendation:\nThis merger will create value by giving CompressCorp a dominant position in the U.S. Market which they can leverage to create value through significant cost reductions resulting from economies of scale and their greater geographic presence. In addition, they can utilize their strength to pursue increased market share in international markets. In order to optimize their profitability, CompressCorp should focus on servicing contracts through the Service Contract model which is 66% more profitable over the Direct Sales model.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: operations strategy; organizational behavior.\nConsulting Firm: Deloitte Consulting first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: tourism, hospitality, lodging; information technology (IT).\nCase Interview Question #00905: The client Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: HLT) is an American global hospitality company that manages and franchises a broad portfolio of hotels and resorts. Hilton Worldwide has 13 brands across different market segments including Conrad Hotels & Resorts, Canopy by Hilton, Curio – A Collection by Hilton, Hilton Hotels & Resorts, DoubleTree by Hilton, Embassy Suites Hotels, Hilton Garden Inn, Hampton Inn, Homewood Suites by Hilton, Home2 Suites by Hilton, Hilton Grand Vacations and Waldorf Astoria Hotels & Resorts. As of January 2016, Hilton Worldwide’s portfolio includes 4,610 hotels with more than 750,000 rooms.\nHilton Worldwide has just completed the development and testing of a POS (point of sale) application for its worldwide hotel chain. The client Hilton Worldwide has retained Deloitte Consulting to develop an implementation strategy. What process would you go through in developing your implementation strategy, and what assumptions would you make in preparing your recommendation?\nAdditional Information:\nThe point of sale (POS) or point of purchase (POP) is the time and place where a retail transaction is completed. It is the point at which a customer makes a payment to the merchant in exchange for goods or after provision of a service. At the point of sale, the merchant would prepare an invoice for the customer (which may be a cash register printout) or otherwise calculate the amount owed by the customer and provide options for the customer to make payment. After receiving payment, the merchant will also normally issue a receipt for the transaction.\nThe client Hilton Worldwide is primarily considering a decision between a phased deployment across various international regions, or a big bang approach that would simultaneously update all the sites concurrently.\nThe client Hilton Worldwide recently used a big bang strategy to deploy a customer service application in all its hotels. This release did not go well due to poor training and lack of adequate testing.\nThe Hilton Worldwide hotel chain has recently made some acquisitions that will require some system integration. These systems have some time-consuming manual operations they would like improved when integrated.\nThe new POS systems contain functionality that must be implemented in the North American Region within six months. Failure to do so would expose the client to possible regulatory litigation.\nHilton Worldwide Hotels are divided into regions as well as by service tiers:\n• Service Tier 1 – Luxury 4 and 5 star hotels catering to top executives and other premium clientele.\n• Service Tier 2 – 3 and 4 star hotels catering to business travelers, and vacationers with moderate to high spending preferences.\n• Service Tier 3 – 2 and 3 star hotels designed to meet the needs of the budget market.\nThe Service Tier 1 hotels help to define the overall brand for the company, so problems with customer service due to a system upgrade would be very damaging.\nThe Service Tier 2 hotels are the largest source of revenue for the client.\nPossible Solution:\nQuestion 1: What additional information would you seek from the client when developing the implementation strategy?\nPossible Answers:\nA good answer will include information about the company’s lessons learned about the recent big bang deployment.\nA great answer will also include information on logical market groupings based on user base and system synergies to identify markets or regions that can be implemented first as well as considerations of the impact of the recent acquisitions including the systems affected to understand if the POS implementation will intedere with the current ongoing activities or if there are synergies that can be leveraged.\nQuestion 2: What are the different implementation options that the client should consider?\nPossible Answers:\nA good answer would list the different options: Big-Bang, Phased, Pilot approach.\nA great answer will include different implementation strategies and rationalization behind choosing an option.\n• A Big-Bang approach where all the hotels are updated simultaneously in a short period of time.\n• A Phased approach by region, or Service Tier of hotel.\n• A Pilot approach where the application would be deployed in a small number of hotels and contingent on a successful implementation, the application would be deployed quickly in the remaining hotels.\nQuestion 3: What are the benefits, disadvantages, and risks that stem from various options?\nPossible Answers:\nA good answer will include advantages, disadvantages, and risks of the options such as:\n• Big-Bang approach – this approach solves business issues quickly, however it also involves the highest level of risk.\n• Phased approach – this approach does not necessarily meet the business needs quickly, however it is a safer approach. A use of this approach should include a discussion of deploying by region or by Service Tier and the risks and advantages associated with the various sub-divisions.\n• Pilot approach – this approach is very much like the big-bang approach, however it blunts some of the risk by the use of a small deployment as a test of the system.\nA great answer will include mitigations for the risks. For example, possible mitigation strategies for the Big-Bang approach could include ensuring proper training and testing.\nQuestion 4: If the candidate opts for a phased approach by service tier, what service tier would he/she recommend implementing the application for first?\nPossible Answers:\nA good answer will acknowledge that implementing the POS first for Service Tier 1 may not be optimal since in case of a failure the brand image may undergo the most significant damage.\nA great answer will recommend either Service Tier 2 or Service Tier 3 as the first implementation along with the\nreasons for the choice:\n• In case the candidate opts for Service Tier 2, he/she should voice the logic of realizing earlier benefits from upgrading the tier that generates the most revenue.\n• Likewise, if the candidate opts for Service Tier 3, he/she should express opting for a “safe strategy” where the upgrade is first tested on the low revenue tiers where a failure will not significantly impact the brand image.\nOverall Evaluation:\nThis is a standard IT implementation strategy case where it is important to understand the client’s needs and determine the best implementation options along associated risks and mitigating actions.\nA strong candidate will:\n• Probe the interviewer for additional information to assess client needs.\n• Consider all options and related advantages and disadvantages before selecting an option.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: improve profitability.\nConsulting Firm: Bain & Company first round summer associate job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: healthcare: hospital & medical.\nCase Interview Question #00903: Your client DaVita Healthcare Partners Inc. is one of the largest kidney care companies in the United States, with corporate headquarters in Denver, Colorado. Their offerings include in-center hemodialysis, in-center nocturnal dialysis, peritoneal dialysis, home hemodialysis, vascular access management, chronic kidney disease education, and renal diet assistance.\nYour client DaVita owns and operates a chain of kidney dialysis centers. Dialysis is a process where patients whose kidneys are not working normally are connected to a machine; their blood is cleaned and then put back into their body. Patients who need this procedure have serious health problems and once they require dialysis, they need it 3 times a week for the rest of their life. Your client DaVita has 1/3 of the market and there is one major competitor that has 1/3 of the market share. The remaining market is made up of independent doctors that own/operate their own small dialysis center. Your client DaVita has grown through acquisition of smaller operations and now the market is at equilibrium (i.e. there are no other acquisition options). They’ve asked you to help them grow their profits. What would you do?\nPossible Answer: \n1. Suggested Framework\na. Company strategy / differentiation from competitors\nb. Revenue streams\nc. Costs\n• Major costs\n• Cost reduction opportunities\n• Benchmark versus competitors\nd. Growth options\n• Expand services\n• Increase prices\n• Capture more market share\n2. Additional Information to Share (if prompted):\na. Treatment centers – Because many hospitals don’t have dialysis facilities, hospital doctors and specialists must refer patients to an outside treatment facility (i.e. our client, our major competitor or one of the independent treatment centers).\nb. Doctors – When graduating from medical school, kidney doctors can go work for a hospital, become a specialist, or they can open their own independent dialysis and treatment practice (much like a dentist does).\nc. Referrals – Patients are referred to a dialysis treatment center by their doctor. Because people don’t know one center from another, they go where their doctor tells them to go.\nd. Costs – Fixed costs are $300K/year, variable costs are $45K per year.\ne. Revenues – Medicare pays $300/treatment, private insurance pays $3000/treatment.\nf. Patients (“product mix”) – 90% of patients have Medicare, 10% have private insurance.\n3. Summary of Key Insights\n• The key to this case is that there are two types of patients: Medicare and private. Medicare patients are not profitable so the company should focus on attracting as many privately insured individuals as possible in order to grow their profits.\n• Doctors are the gatekeepers for dialysis centers and must be targeted.\n• Make sure that interviewee walks through revenues, costs, profit analysis (breakevens), and strategies for growth.\n4. Walkthrough of Solution\na. Costs\n• Ask what the major cost items are: building leases, equipment (dialysis machines), labor (nurses, technicians), supplies and materials (drugs, needles), promotions.\n• Fixed costs are $300K/year\n• Variable costs include the drugs sold to patients and amount to $45K per year\n• Things to mention if asked: the building and machines are already leased, wages are generally competitive. Overall, our costs are lower than our competition.\nb. Revenue\n• Medicare pays $300 per treatment\n• Private insurance pays $3000 per treatment\n• Prices are determined by the market, so the company has little control over influencing price.\nc. Patients\n• 90% of patients have Medicare, 10% have private insurance.\nd. Profitability\nEach patients receive 52 weeks x 3 treatments/week = 156 treatments per year\nMedicare patient:\n• Each Medicare patient provides 156 x $300 = $46,800 in revenue;\n• Variable costs = $45K;\n• Profit = $46,800 – $45,000 = $1,800 / year\nPrivate insured patient:\n• Each privately insured patient provides 156 x $3,000 = $468,000 in revenue;\n• Variable costs = $45K;\n• Profit = $468,800 – $45,000 = $423,000 in profit per year (enough to pay for the annual fixed costs of the entire dialysis center $300K/year)\nOnce the candidate realizes that one privately insured person covers the yearly expenses of the entire operation, ask them how many Medicare patients a center would have to treat to cover their fixed costs: $300,000 / $1,800 = 167 patients\nNote: this section could have been solved using breakevens directly (167 patients for Medicare, 1 patient for privately insured).\nAt this point, ask the candidate what they think our client can do to increase the chances that doctors will refer privately insured patients to us instead of our competitors.\nPossible Solution:\n• Market our centers to doctors who have private patients (using data from geographic area, demographics, hospital information).\n• Because privately insured people are more likely to be wealthy, improve the facility to make it feel more like a spa so that we can differentiate our treatment centers from the competition.\n• Look into launching a marketing campaign to build brand awareness so that patients will go to their doctors asking to be referred to our centers.\n• Build relationships as soon as doctors graduate from school so they have a loyalty to our client.\n• Work out an incentive structure where doctors are rewarded for referring patients (if that’s legal). \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Assume half of that for the developing world.\n• Vaccines require refrigeration and have expiration dates from 6 months to years.\n• Exhibit 1.

Summary of Key Insights\n• Before using the chart (Exhibit 1), it’s important to know what you are calculating and why.\n• When “what other issues” questions come up, the top candidates will ask details about the product (to realize it needs refrigeration) and whether or not there is more capacity.\n• One of the trickier parts of this case is the terminology – health care, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, vaccines… must be careful not to overlap or switch words. Also, the vaccine market should be considered external to the “health care distribution” market, which is the industry in which our client currently operates.\n4. Walkthrough of Solution\na. Market Sizing\nPopulation of developed world\n• North America\n• Europe\n• Part of Asia Pacific (Japan)\nTotal population: ~1.2 billion\n100% of people get vaccinated: ~1.2 billion\nBabies: Assume a life expectancy of 80 years in developed world, thus 1.2 billion / 80 = 15 million babies are born every year.\nNew born babies get a group of 10 doses vaccines in their first year: 15M * 10 = 150M doses/year\nNon-babies: get 2 doses every ten years, thus every year 1/10 of the population get 2 doses vaccines: 1,185M * 10% * 2 = 237M doses/year\nTotal dosage in developed world = 150M + 237M = 387M/year\nPopulation of undeveloped countries: ~4.8 billion\n20% get vaccinated: 4.8 billion * 20% = 960M\nBabies: Assume a life expectancy of 60 years in developing world, thus 960M / 60 = 16 million new born babies get vaccinated every year.\nNew born babies get a group of 5 doses vaccines (half the dosage of developed world): 16M * 5 = 80M doses/year\nNon-babies: get 1 dose every ten years (half the dosage of developed world), thus every year 1/10 people get 1 dose vaccine: 944M * 10% = 94M doses/year\nTotal dosage in developing world = 80M + 94M = 174M/year\nTotal size of global market = 387M + 174M = 560M doses vaccines per year\nb. Make initial determination of level of demand, and our ability to meet it.\n• Based on additional facts given in the case, it’s somewhat logical that this is true – since only the 20% are covered by NGO, and we have excess capacity.\n• Next: is this market actually attractive?\nc. Dive further into demand analysis; look at financial market size\n• At this point the interviewee must ask for cost and pricing numbers.\n• Multiply the market sizes (calculated above) by potential revenue from each.\nTotal dosage in developed world = 387M/year\nPrice = $100/dose\nMarket size in $ = 387M * $100 = $38.7B\nTotal dosage in developing world = 174M/year\nPrice = $60/dose\nMarket size in $ = 174M * $60 = $10.4B\nTotal market size = $38.7B + $10.4B = $49.1B\n• It’s key to discover that costs and pricing (for the client at least) is the same in both developed and developing.\nd. Analysis of the current market situation\n• Qualitative analysis looks good – competitors are not well-represented in vaccine field.\n• However, quantitative analysis reveals that the vaccine market is already more than 90% saturated (this is done backwards by using the fact that our client has $90 Billion in revenue and has 15% global market share).\nTotal global market size = $90 Billion / 15% = $600 Billion\nCompetitor 1′s revenue = $600 Billion * 10% = $60B\nCompetitor 1′s vaccine revenue = $60B * 15% = $9B\nCompetitor 2′s revenue = $600 Billion * 8% = $48B\nCompetitor 2′s vaccine revenue = $48B * 75% = $36B\nTotal vaccine revenues of Competitor 1 and 2 = $9B + $36B = $45B\nTotal vaccine market share of Competitor 1 and 2 = $45B / $49.1B = 91.6%\n• Thus conclusion is that in order to enter the vaccine market effectively, our client Johnson & Johnson must expand the market to those who are in need but are not currently using the product, mostly those in the developing nations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

(think of it as Lockheed Martin) is an American global aerospace, defense, security and advanced technologies company with worldwide interests. Headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, in the Washington, DC, area, the company is one of the world’s largest defense contractors based on revenues.\nAerospace Co. operates in five business segments: Aeronautics, Information Systems & Global Solutions, Missiles and Fire Control, Mission Systems and Training, and Space Systems. The company also invests in healthcare systems, renewable energy systems, intelligent energy distribution and compact nuclear fusion. As a clear market leader operating in the Aerospace & Defense industry, it has many patented high-technology products.\nThe year is 2010. Aerospace Co.’s profits have declined in recent years. The CTO of Aerospace Co. is evaluating an investment in a new technology: lighter-than-air (LTA) vehicles. Will an investment in LTA vehicles restore the client’s profitability to previous levels?\nAdditional Information: \nA lighter-than-air (LTA) vehicle is an aircraft (the average density of the craft is lower than the density of atmospheric air) that gains its lift through the use of a buoyant gas. LTA vehicles include unpowered balloons and powered airships. LTA vehicles are mainly used in intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) or lift missions.\nExhibit 1.

ISR LTA vehicles\nLet the breakeven production volume be X,\nProduct costs = $9.0M * 10 + $7.0M * 10 + $6.5M * (X-20) = ($6.5X + $30)M\nR&D and facility costs = $245.25M + $50.75M = $296M\nTotal costs = ($6.5X + $30)M + $296M = ($6.5X + $326)M\nExpected Revenues = $10.2M * X\nSet up the breakeven equation: 6.5X + 326 = 10.2X\nSolving for X, we get X = 88.1 =~ 89\nb. Lift LTA vehicles\nLet the breakeven production volume be Y,\nProduct costs = $25.0M * 10 + $23.0M * 10 + $21.0M * (Y-20) = $(21Y + 60)M\nR&D and facility costs = $50M + $55M = $105M\nTotal costs = $(21Y + 60)M + $105M = $(21Y + 165)M\nExpected Revenues = $25.1M * Y\nSet up the breakeven equation: 25.1Y = 21Y + 165\nSolving for Y, we get Y = 40.2 =~ 41\nQuestion 2: Are LTA vehicles an attractive investment opportunity for the client?\nPossible Answer:\nBased on the market forecasts for ISR and Lift missions (Exhibit 6), the annual demand for ISR and Lift LTA vehicles are: 800 * 20% = 160, 360 * 10% = 36, respectively. Therefore, the client will be able to break even in the first year for ISR LTA vehicles, and in less than two years for Lift LTA vehicles. An investment in LTA vehicles looks very promising financially.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: business competition, competitive response.\nConsulting Firm: Boston Consulting Group (BCG) 2nd round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: retail.\nCase Interview Question #00907: Your client Loblaws is the largest discount retailer in Canada, with more than 500 stores spread throughout the country. Headquartered in Brampton, Ontario, Loblaws stores are mostly located in Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec. Loblaws is a division of Loblaw Companies Limited, Canada’s largest food distributor.\nFor several years running, the client Loblaws has surpassed the second largest Canadian retailer (with ~300 stores) in both relative market share and profitability. However, the largest discount retailer in the United States, Walmart, has just bought out Loblaws’s competition Woolworth Canada Inc. and is planning to convert all 300 Woolworth stores to Walmart stores. The CEO of Loblaws is quite perturbed by this turn of events, and asks you the following questions: Should I be worried? How should I react? How would you advise the CEO of Loblaws?\nAdditional Information: to be given to candidate upon request\n(1) Company\n• A discount retailer sells a large variety of consumer goods at discounted prices, generally carrying everything from grocery to consumer products, from housewares and home appliances to clothing. Prime examples include Kmart, Woolworth, Target, and Wal-Mart.\n• Loblaws stores have a wide variety of brand names.\n• Loblaws uses a franchise model in which each individual store is owned and managed by a franchisee who has invested in the store and retains part of the profit.\n• Loblaws sells about $750 million worth of goods annually.\n(2) Competition\nA. Canadian Competitor\n• Loblaws’ stores are located in similar geographic regions as the competition’s. In fact, you might even see a Loblaws store on one corner, and the competition on the very next corner.\n• Loblaws’ stores tend to have a wider variety of brand names, but by and large, the product mix is similar.\n• For certain items Loblaws is less expensive, and for others the competition is less expensive, but the average price level is similar.\n• Loblaws has higher profits than the competition on a per-store basis.\n• Loblaws’ cost structure isn’t any lower than the competition’s. Its higher per-store profits are due to higher per-store sales.\n• Loblaws’ average store size is approximately the same as that of the competition.\n• The competitor’s stores are centrally owned by the company while Loblaws are franchised.\nB. U.S. Competitor: Walmart\n• Walmart owns 4,000 stores in the U.S. and the second-largest competitor in the U.S. owns approximately 1,000 stores.\n• Walmart stores average 200,000 square feet, whereas the typical discount retail store is approximately 100,000 square feet.\n• Walmart’s sales are approximately $5 billion, whereas the nearest competitor sells about $1 billion worth of merchandise.\n• Its cost of goods is approximately 15% less than that of the competition (due to volume of sales giving it clout with suppliers).\n• Its prices are on average about 10% lower than those of the competition.\n• Walmart has larger selection of products, given the larger average store size.\n• Walmart was started by building superstores in rural markets served mainly by mom-and-pop stores and small discount retailers. Walmart bet that people would be willing to buy from it, and it was right.\n• As it grew and developed more clout with suppliers, it began to buy out other discount retailers and convert their stores to the Walmart format.\n• When a store is converted to the Walmart format, it carries the same brands at prices that are on average 10% lower than the competition’s.\n• Walmart decides whether it should physically expand a store it’s just bought out based on several factors, such as the size of the existing store, local market competition, local real estate costs, and so on (but it doesn’t plan to expand the Canadian stores beyond their current size).\n• Although members of the Canadian business community are certainly familiar with the company because of its United States success, the Canadian consumer is basically unaware of Walmart’s existence.\n• Loblaws and Walmart carry similar products, although the Loblaws stores lean more heavily toward Canadian suppliers.\n• Canada has significantly higher labor costs than the U.S., but Loblaws must also cope with the same high labor costs.\nPossible Answer:\n1. Canadian Competitor\nAfter comparing Loblaws to its Canadian competitors, the interviewee should realize that:\n• Loblaws stores are better managed, since the individual store owners have a greater incentive to maximize profit.\n• Loblaws’ higher sales are due primarily to a significantly higher level of customer service. The stores are cleaner, more attractive, better stocked and so on. The company discovered this through a series of customer surveys last year.\n2. Walmart\nSimilarly, after comparing Loblaws to its U.S. competitor Walmart, the interviewee will realize that:\n• Walmart might incur higher distribution costs than Loblaws because it will have to ship products from its United States warehouses up to Canada.\n• Loblaws has the advantage in distribution costs, since its network spans less geographic area and it gets more products from Canadian suppliers.\nOnce the interviewee reaches the above conclusion, the following additional information can be shared if asked for:\n• However, since Loblaws continues to get a good deal of products from the United States, the actual advantage to Loblaws is not great – only about 2% of overall costs.\n• Walmart will be able to retain a significant price advantage over Loblaws’ stores: if not 10%, then at least 7%-8%.\n3. Conclusions\nIn the near term, Loblaws might be safe. Its stores have a much stronger brand name in Canada than Walmart’s, and they seem to be well managed. However, as consumers get used to seeing prices that are consistently 7%-8% less at Walmart, they will realize that shopping at Walmart means significant savings over the course of the year.\nAlthough some consumers will remain loyal out of habit or because of the high level of service, it is reasonable to expect the discount shopper to shop where prices are lowest. Moreover, over time Loblaws’ brand-name advantage will erode as Walmart becomes more familiar to Canadian consumers. Loblaws certainly has to worry about losing significant market share to Walmart stores in the long term. They should probably do something about it now, before it’s too late.\n4. Recommendations to the client Loblaws\n• Find ways to cut costs and make the organization more efficient, so it can keep prices low even if its cost of goods is higher.\n• Consider instituting something like a customer loyalty program or frequent shopper program, where consumers accumulate points that entitle them to future discounts on merchandise (might not be that cost-effective, since it would be rewarding a significant number of shoppers who would have continued to shop there anyway).\n• Prepare a marketing or advertising campaign that highlights its high level of service. Perhaps even institute a Loblaws Service Guarantee that surpasses any guarantees offered by Walmart.\n• Consider offering fewer product lines, so that it can consolidate its buying power and negotiate prices with suppliers that are competitive with Walmart’s. It might lose some customers who want the variety of products that Walmart has, but it may be able to retain the customer who is buying a limited array of items and is just looking for the best price.\nSample Interview Transcript\n1. Establish understanding of the case\nCandidate: So, the client, Loblaws, is facing competition in Canada from a United States competitor. Our task is to evaluate the extent of the threat and advise the client on a strategy. Before I can advise the CEO I need some more information about the situation. First of all, I’m not sure I understand what a discount retailer is!\nInterviewer: A discount retailer sells a large variety of consumer goods at discounted prices, generally carrying everything from housewares and appliances to clothing. Kmart, Woolworth, Target, and Wal-Mart are prime examples in the United States.\n2. Set up the framework\nCandidate: Oh, I see. Then I think it makes sense to structure the problem this way: First, let’s understand the competition in the Canadian market and how Loblaws has become the market leader. Then let’s look at the United States to understand how Walmart has achieved its position. At the end, we can merge the two discussions to understand whether Walmart’s strength in the United States is transferable to the Canadian market.\nInterviewer: That sounds fine. Let’s start, then, with the Canadian discount retail market. What would you like to know?\n3. Evaluate the case using the framework\nCandidate: Are Loblaws’ 500 stores close to the competition’s 300 stores, or do they serve different geographic areas?\nInterviewer: The stores are located in similar geographic regions. In fact, you might even see a Loblaws store on one corner, and the competition on the very next corner.\nCandidate: Do Loblaws and the competition sell a similar product mix?\nInterviewer: Yes. Loblaws stores tend to have a wider variety of brand names, but by and large, the product mix is similar.\nCandidate: Are Loblaws’ prices significantly lower than the competition’s?\nInterviewer: No. For certain items Loblaws is less expensive, and for others the competition is less expensive, but the average price level is similar.\nCandidate: Is Loblaws more profitable just because it has more stores, or does it have higher profits per store?\nInterviewer: It actually has higher profits than the competition on a per-store basis.\nCandidate: Well, higher profits could be the result of lower costs or higher revenues. Are the higher per-store profits due to lower costs than the competition’s or the result of higher per-store sales?\nInterviewer: Loblaws’ cost structure isn’t any lower than the competition’s. Its higher per-store profits are due to higher per-store sales.\nCandidate: Is that because it has bigger stores?\nInterviewer: No. Loblaws’ average store size is approximately the same as that of the competition.\nCandidate: If they’re selling similar products at similar prices in similarly-sized stores in similar locations, why are Loblaws’ per-store sales higher than the competition’s?\nInterviewer: It’s your job to figure that out!\nCandidate: Is Loblaws better managed than the competition?\nInterviewer: I don’t know that Loblaws as a company is necessarily better managed, but I can tell you that its management model for individual stores is significantly different.\nCandidate: How so?\nInterviewer: The competitor’s stores are centrally owned by the company, while Loblaws uses a franchise model in which each individual store is owned and managed by a franchisee who has invested in the store and retains part of the profit.\nCandidate: In that case, I would guess that the Loblaws stores are probably better managed, since the individual storeowners have a greater incentive to maximize profit.\nInterviewer: You are exactly right. It turns out that Loblaws’ higher sales are due primarily to a significantly higher level of customer service. The stores are cleaner, more attractive, better stocked, and so on. The company discovered this through a series of customer surveys last year. I think you’ve sufficiently covered the Canadian market—let’s move now to a discussion of the United States market.\nCandidate: How many stores does Walmart own in the United States, and how many does the second-largest discount retailer own?\nInterviewer: Walmart owns 4,000 stores and the second-largest competitor owns approximately 1,000 stores.\nCandidate: Are Walmart stores bigger than those of the typical discount retailer in the United States?\nInterviewer: Yes. Walmart stores average 200,000 square feet, whereas the typical discount retail store is approximately 100,000 square feet.\nCandidate: Those numbers suggest that Walmart should be selling roughly eight times the volume of the nearest United States competitor!\nInterviewer: Close. Walmart’s sales are approximately $5 billion, whereas the nearest competitor sells about $1 billion worth of merchandise.\nCandidate: I would think that sales of that size give Walmart significant clout with suppliers. Does it have a lower cost of goods than the competition?\nInterviewer: In fact, its cost of goods is approximately 15 percent less than that of the competition.\nCandidate: So it probably has lower prices.\nInterviewer: Right again. Its prices are on average about ten percent lower than those of the competition.\nCandidate: So it seems that Walmart has been so successful primarily because it has lower prices than its competitors.\nInterviewer: That’s partly right. Its success probably also has something to do with a larger selection of products, given the larger average store size.\nCandidate: How did Walmart get so much bigger than the competition?\nInterviewer: It started by building superstores in rural markets served mainly by mom-and-pop stores and small discount retailers. Walmart bet that people would be willing to buy from it, and it was right. As it grew and developed more clout with suppliers, it began to buy out other discount retailers and convert their stores to the Walmart format.\nCandidate: So whenever Walmart buys out a competing store, it also physically expands it?\nInterviewer: Not necessarily. Sometimes it does, but when I said it converts it to the Walmart format, I meant that it carries the same brands at prices that are on average ten percent lower than the competition’s.\nCandidate: What criteria does Walmart use in deciding whether it should physically expand a store it’s just bought out?\nInterviewer: It depends on a lot of factors, such as the size of the existing store, local market competition, local real estate costs, and so on, but I don’t think we need to go into that here.\nCandidate: Well, I thought it might be relevant in terms of predicting what it will do with the 300 stores that it bought in Canada.\nInterviewer: Let’s just assume that it doesn’t plan to expand the Canadian stores beyond their current size.\nCandidate: OK. I think I’ve learned enough about Walmart. I’d like to ask a few questions about Walmart’s ability to succeed in the Canadian market. Does Walmart have a strong brand name in Canada?\nInterviewer: No. Although members of the Canadian business community are certainly familiar with the company because of its United States success, the Canadian consumer is basically unaware of Walmart’s existence.\nCandidate: Does Loblaws carry products similar to Walmart’s, or does the Canadian consumer expect different products and brands than the United States discount retail consumer?\nInterviewer: The two companies carry similar products, although the Loblaws stores lean more heavily toward Canadian suppliers.\nCandidate: How much volume does Loblaws actually sell?\nInterviewer: About $750 million worth of goods annually.\nCandidate: Is there any reason to think that the costs of doing business for Walmart will be higher in the Canadian market?\nInterviewer: Can you be more specific?\nCandidate: I mean, for example, are labor or leasing costs higher in Canada than in the United States?\nInterviewer: Canada does have significantly higher labor costs, and I’m not sure about the costs of leasing space. What are you driving at?\nCandidate: I was thinking that if there were a higher cost of doing business in Canada, perhaps Walmart would have to charge higher prices than it does in the United States to cover its costs.\nInterviewer: That’s probably true, but remember, Loblaws must also cope with the same high labor costs. Can you think of additional costs incurred by Walmart’s Canadian operations that would not be incurred by Loblaws?\nCandidate: Walmart might incur higher distribution costs than Loblaws because it will have to ship product from its United States warehouses up to Canada.\nInterviewer: You are partially right. Loblaws has the advantage in distribution costs, since its network spans less geographic area and it gets more products from Canadian suppliers. However, since Loblaws continues to get a good deal of product from the United States, the actual advantage to Loblaws is not great—only about two percent of overall costs.\nCandidate: All this suggests that Walmart will be able to retain a significant price advantage over Loblaws stores: if not ten percent, then at least seven to eight percent.\nInterviewer: I would agree with that conclusion.\n4. Summarize and make recommendations\nCandidate: I would tell the CEO the following: In the near term, you might be safe. Your stores have a much stronger brand name in Canada than Walmart’s, and they seem to be well managed. However, as consumers get used to seeing prices that are consistently seven to eight percent less at Walmart, they will realize that shopping at Walmart means significant savings over the course of the year.\nAlthough some consumers will remain loyal out of habit or because of your high level of service, it is reasonable to expect the discount shopper to shop where prices are lowest. Moreover, over time your brand-name advantage will erode as Walmart becomes more familiar to Canadian consumers. You certainly have to worry about losing significant share to Walmart stores in the long term. You should probably do something about it now, before it’s too late.\nInterviewer: Can you suggest possible strategies for Loblaws?\nCandidate: Maybe it can find ways to cut costs and make the organization more efficient, so it can keep prices low even if its cost of goods is higher.\nInterviewer: Anything else?\nCandidate: It might consider instituting something like a frequent shopper program, where consumers accumulate points that entitle them to future discounts on merchandise.\nInterviewer: What might be a potential problem with that?\nCandidate: Well, it might not be that cost-effective, since it would be rewarding a significant number of shoppers who would have continued to shop there anyway.\nInterviewer: Any other suggestions?\nCandidate: Loblaws might want to prepare a marketing or advertising campaign that highlights its high level of service. It might even institute a Loblaws Service Guarantee that surpasses any guarantees offered by Walmart.\nInterviewer: Assuming the only way to keep customers is through competitive pricing, is there anything Loblaws can do to appear competitive to the consumer?\nCandidate: It might want to consider offering fewer product lines, so that it can consolidate its buying power and negotiate prices with suppliers that are competitive with Walmart’s. It might lose some customers who want the variety of products that Walmart has, but it may be able to retain the customer who is buying a limited array of items and is just looking for the best price.\nInterviewer: All of your suggestions are interesting, and you would want to analyze the advantages and disadvantages of each in more detail before making any recommendations to the CEO.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Jewel-Osco has 185 stores across northern, central, and western Illinois; eastern Iowa; and portions of northwest Indiana. Jewel-Osco and Jewel are currently wholly owned subsidiaries of Boise, Idaho-based grocery company Albertsons Companies Inc.\nThe client Jewel-Osco is facing a very difficult situation lately. Low-price competitors like Wal-Mart, Costco, Target, and Dollar General are stealing market share and eroding margins in the traditional grocery business. Therefore, other departments within its stores, such as produce and deli, are becoming increasingly important to our client’s financial health.\nIn particular, the client Jewel-Osco is concerned about their deli department,  a $700M business that has been reporting no profit growth over the last few years (from 2012 to 2014). The deli department consists of two main business lines: (1) deli meats and (2) prepared foods (sandwiches, fried chicken, etc.)\nWe have been asked to help the client understand why their deli profits are not growing and what they need to do to turn things around. How would you go about it?\nAdditional Information: to share with interviewee upon request \n1. The client’s deli financials (Show Exhibit 1 below)\nExhibit 1.

Overall industry trend and customers\n• Deli meat category has been flat to slightly declining recently.\n• Prepared foods category has been growing at roughly 10% per year as people have less time to cook at home.\n3. Competitors\n• Increasing competition from deli departments of other supermarkets, discounters, etc. – e.g., expanding product lines, increasing advertising.\n• The client Jewel-Osco also competes with fast food restaurants in prepared foods category.\n4. Client’s product mix and recent events\n• Product mix has remained constant, with exception of two products introduced a couple of years ago – BBQ chicken wings and “made to order” sandwiches.\n• Both BBQ chicken wings and “made to order” sandwiches have been a major boost to prepared foods revenue.\n5. Info on new products\n• BBQ wings are similar to the chicken wings the company already sells, although they take a little longer to fry and are tossed in BBQ sauce after frying.\n• “Made to order” sandwiches is client’s response to Subway, etc. – for two hours during lunchtime and two hours during dinnertime, one employee’s sole task is to make sandwiches to order for customers.\n6. Financials of new products\n• Revenues for each product are $40M annually.\n• Costs not broken down at product level.\n• Give information on Exhibit 2 as requested (but do not hand Exhibit 2 directly to interviewee).\nExhibit 2.

BBQ wings\nPrice: $5 for 20 pieces\nTotal material cost: $0.10 per piece\nPrep time: 15 minutes per batch of 200\nEmployee cost: $20 per hour (fully loaded)\n**Total COGS: $2.50 per 20 pieces\n**Margin: $2.50 per 20 pieces\nB. “Made-to-order” sandwiches\nPrice: $4 per sandwich\nAverage sales/store per day: 20 sandwiches\nTotal material cost: $2 per sandwich\nEmployee cost: $20 per hour (fully loaded)\nDedicated hours: 4 hours per day\n**Revenue: $80 per store per day\n**Total COGS: $120 per store per day\n**Margin: $(40) per store per day\nNote: ** indicate figures that should be calculated by the interviewee\nPossible Answer:\nMain question: What should the supermarket chain do to turn around deli business?\n1. Key areas to explore:\nA. Revenue and profit breakdown within deli\n• Deli meat revenue and profits flat – consistent with overall category\n• Prepared foods showing revenue growth (10% consistent with category) but no profit growth – therefore declining margins – why?\n- because made-to-order (MTO) sandwiches losses offsetting profit growth from BBQ wings\nB. External factors influencing the overall deli market\n• People have less time to cook at home – prepared foods category growing, deli meats category flat.\n• Increasing competition from other deli departments – starting to expand product lines, increase advertising, etc.\n2. Recommendation\n• Eliminate made-to-order sandwiches (at least in low-traffic stores or during non-peak hours)\n• Raise or lower prices on made-to-order sandwiches (depending on demand elasticity)\n• Boost demand for made-to-order sandwiches (e.g., advertising, promotions, merchandising)\n3. Other Factors\n• Eliminating MTO sandwiches or boosting demand can impact overall traffic in store and deli\n4. Framework and Detailed Analysis\nThere are three main questions that the interviewee needs to answer\n• Which part of the business is responsible for the lack of profit growth – deli meats, prepared foods, or both?\n• Is the lack of profit growth caused by flat revenues, increasing costs, or both?\n• What is causing the flat revenues or increasing costs (and what should the client do)?\nBased on Exhibit 1, the interviewee will see that gross margins for both business lines are flat. Furthermore, deli meat sales have been basically flat while prepared foods sales have been growing at 10%.\nThe interviewee should recognize that the client’s deli meat and prepared food sales have been growing at about the category averages; therefore, revenues are not the main issue here. Deli meat COGS have been more or less flat, mirroring sales. However, despite robust growth in prepared food sales, prepared food profits have been flat, implying deteriorating margins.\nAt this point, ask the interviewee for some potential reasons for deteriorating margins (e.g., change in product/sales mix, rising material costs, rising labor costs).\nIt is critical that the interviewee asks about changes in product mix, in which case the interviewer should inform him about the BBQ chicken wings and the “made to order” sandwiches. The interviewee should be suspicious at this point and ask to learn more about these products.\nBy doing a back of the envelope analysis of product profitability (based on data in Exhibit 2), the interviewee will find that BBQ wings have a 50% margin, indicating that they are not a problem. On the other hand, the interviewee will find that the client is losing a lot of money on the “made to order” sandwich concept.\nThe interviewee should then be asked for recommendations, which could include:\n(1) eliminating the “made to order” sandwich,\n(2) restricting the sandwich to busier stores or during busier times of the day (e.g., lunch hours only),\n(3) raising or lowering prices (to either increase profit per sale or units sold – will depend on demand elasticity),\n(4) boost demand (through increased advertising, promotions, better merchandising, etc.)\nA good answer will also consider the second-order effects of eliminating the product or boosting sales (the effect on traffic in the deli and the overall store).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: growth; improve profitability; math problem.\nConsulting Firm: McKinsey & Company 2nd round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: restaurant & food service.\nCase Interview Question #00890: Sonic Corp., more commonly known as Sonic Drive-In or simply just Sonic, is an American drive-in fast-food restaurant chain based in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The chain has over 3,000 stores in the United States, mostly concentrated in the South. Sonic restaurants are structured as old-fashioned drive-ins: each store has 20 to 30 drive-in spots where patrons can order and receive their food while seated in their cars. The stores have no seating areas. The menu at Sonic’s menu can be broken down into 3 categories:\n(1) Main courses: Burger, fried chicken, corn dogs, chili dogs and toaster sandwiches, etc.\n(2) Sodas: Over 300 varieties, some of which are proprietary.\n(3) Desserts: Milkshakes and other ice cream desserts.\nDuring the first 20 years of its operations, Sonic’s business grew steadily. Last year, however, Sonic’s business declined significantly. Their CEO has hired McKinsey to determine a growth strategy for the business.\nPossible Answer:\nInterviewer: Given this information, brainstorm some initial ideas on a growth strategy for the client.\nCandidate: I would look first at the big picture of store placement and profitability. Next, consider the option of opening more stores, closing unprofitable stores, or adopting a franchise model.\nNext, analyze the revenue and cost sides of the business.\nUnder revenue we could look at growing the customer base, or targeting the most profitable customers. For products, you could look at their product pricing, product mix, and differentiation. My first impression is that having more than 300 kinds of sodas is a bit too much and will cost the business in terms of distribution and inventory costs. We should definitely do some consumer research and see what items in each category the customers really want and what differentiates the brand from other chains.\nIn terms of costs,  Sonic should look at their fixed and variable costs. The first thing I would want to look at is the cost of raw materials. This company has such a high variety of products offered at each restaurant; I’m wondering how much they are spending for food and drinks? Also, with all of these sodas distribution costs may be high with multiple suppliers. Storage costs may be high given the product mix.\nI’m also curious about competition. How are stores doing in high-density areas with lots of competition, versus areas with low competition?\nInterviewer: Okay, these are some great ideas. Let’s move on. The client Sonic has also launched some pilot restaurants that have seating areas. I have some data on the performance of these pilot stores as compared to the standard stores (show the candidate the following charts).\nChart 1. Standard Restaurants\n\n\n\nCategory\nPrice\nQuantity Sold\nProfit Margin\n\n\nBurgers etc.\n$2.00\n15,000\n15%\n\n\nSodas\n$2.00\n10,000\n10%\n\n\nMilkshakes\n$4.00\n5,000\n20%\n\n\n\nChart 2. Pilot Restaurants\n\n\n\nCategory\nPrice\nQuantity Sold\nProfit Margin\n\n\nBurgers etc.\n$2.00\n25,000\n15%\n\n\nSodas\n$2.00\n15,000\n10%\n\n\nMilkshakes\n$4.50\n10,000\n25%\n\n\n\nInterviewer: What are some of your initial impressions of this data? Can you talk about some of the benefits and drawbacks to the pilot model?\nCandidate: Immediately I see that the price for milkshakes has increased along with the margin for milkshakes, while sales have doubled. This is interesting. Doubling sales while putting an item at a higher price point is a great move – I’m wondering if Sonic’s standard restaurant has room to increase their price or if something about the store format is increasing milkshake sales.\nThinking about the buying process in the pilot stores, perhaps people buy their food and a soda first, and then go up to the register again and buy a milkshake. Since they are sitting around enjoying their food with their family, they then have the option of buying a round of milkshakes for everyone (if they aren’t completely full). In the standard store format, people might just have one transaction and drive away while they are still eating, so they are already home when they decide they want a milkshake.\nIt is interesting the pilot stores don’t have higher prices for main course food and sodas. This data suggests that they might have some mark-up potential. This is a possible revenue strategy. Also, these pilot restaurants are doing a higher volume overall. We might want to explore the opening of more pilot restaurants or converting some stand locations to this model.\nInterviewer: Okay, let’s get into some calculations on the standard restaurant model. The client Sonic thinks their milkshake business has a lot of potential. They are wondering how many soda sales they would have to convert to milkshake sales at an average store in order to increase their profit margin to 18% total for all sales.\nCandidate: Okay, so the client wants to subtract X sodas from 10,000 and add X milkshakes to 5,000 in order to reach a 20% profit margin at an average store. I have to start by figuring out what the profit margin is overall at a store.\nRevenue = Price * Quantity\nBurgers: $2 x 15,000 = $30,000 @ a profit margin of 15% means that profits are $4,500\nSodas: $2 x 10,000 = $20,000 @ a profit margin of 10% means that profits are $2,000\nMilkshakes: $4 x 5,000 = $20,000 @ a profit margin of 20% means that profits are $4,000\nOverall revenue = $30,000 + $20,000 + $20,000 = $70,000\nOverall profit = $4,500 + $2,000 + $4,000 = $10,500\nprofit margin = $10,500 / $70,000 = 15%\nLooking at the sale of a soda and then of a milkshake:\n• Soda: $2.00\n• Milkshake: $4.00\n• The difference between the 2 sales is $2.00\n• Converting X number of Soda to Milkshake will increase the total revenue by X * $2.00\nThen, looking at the profit on an individual sale of a soda and then of a milkshake:\n• Soda: $2.00 at 10% margin = 20 cents\n• Milkshake: $4.00 at 20% margin = 80 cents\n• The difference between the 2 profits is 60 cents ($0.60).\n• Converting X number of Soda to Milkshake will increase the total profit by X * $0.60\nSo, letting X = required number of conversions from sodas to milkshakes.\nNew overall revenue = $70,000 + X * $2.00\nNew overall profit = $10,500 + X * $0.60\nNew overall profit margin = ($10,500 + X * $0.60) / ($70,000 + X * $2.00) = 18%\nSolving for X, we get X = 8,750\nInterviewer: Alright, so summarize your recommendations for the client.\nCandidate:\n• Recap case: We were hired by Scottie’s to determine a growth strategy for a declining business.\n• From the data analyzed, shifting from the standard drive-in model to the pilot model (with seated areas) should boost both revenues and margins per restaurant.\n• If we maintained some standard restaurants for reasons of branding nolstagia, we should shift consumer beverage purchases from sodas to milkshakes, to drive up margins further within existing standard restaurants.\n• There are also other big-picture strategies we have not yet explored, such as franchising, but please speak to my Director of Client Services if you wish to extend this engagement and keep the team on for another month.

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: reduce costs; math problem.\nConsulting Firm: McKinsey & Company 2nd round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: healthcare: hospital & medical; government.\nCase Interview Question #00891: Luxembourg is a small landlocked country in western Europe. It is bordered by Belgium to the west and north, Germany to the east, and France to the south. With an area of 2,586 square kilometers (998 sq mi), it is one of the smallest sovereign states in Europe (about the same size as the state of Rhode Island or the English county of Northamptonshire). Luxembourg has a population of about 1 million.\nOur client is the health minister of Luxembourg. Luxembourg is small and on the upper end of the GDP spectrum for countries of its size. The country’s health system is completely free to its citizens, and is funded by taxpayer money. The way that the health care system works is that patients can visit one of 30 clinics spread throughout the country for a primary care visit, and then get referred to one of 2 larger hospitals if more intensive procedures are required. There are a few private systems for the richest citizens, but they are so small in comparison to the public system that they won’t be considered at all in our study. The GDP, and thus the tax returns for the country have been growing at a 5% rate. However, the healthcare budget has required 10% growth to keep up with demand. The health minister of Luxembourg is concerned that at this rate, the healthcare system will become unsustainable. The Luxembourg health minister has hired McKinsey & Company to figure out why the healthcare budget is requiring this level of growth and what can be done to reduce it.\nPossible Answer: \nPart 1: Examining possible reasons for budget growth\nInterviewer: What factors do you believe are going into the budget growth?\nPossible Answer:\nThe candidate should come up with a framework that explores:\na. Demand-driven growth reasons such as\n• demographic changes leading to a larger number of people visiting hospitals.\n• changes in health perception or awareness in the population such that citizens go to the doctor in response to problems for which they formerly stayed home.\n• the incentive systems of doctors and hospitals who may be encouraging-patients to come in so that they get paid more for more visits or who may be referring more patients to the 2 bigger hospitals than is necessary.\nb. Supply-side effects such as\n• shortage of doctors or resources bidding up prices for the same services.\n• a lack of preventative care services making patients less healthy and thus needing of more healthcare when they actually do get ill.\nInterviewer: Now that you have identified some reasons for budget growth, let us address how we can cut costs. What are some of the things they could do and what would be the potential risks associated with those?\nPossible Answer:\nPossible solutions that the candidate can come up with include:\n• Transparency: if physicians don’t currently know what various treatments cost, making them aware and helping them take that information into account would be a first step.\n• Quotas/Rules: We can require that physicians prescribe a certain amount of generic drugs rather than branded, or that simpler, outpatient procedures be used when possible rather than allowing people to stay several nights in the hospital.\n• Risks: We need to ensure that the rules don’t reduce the quality of care overall, so physicians need to be involved in crafting the rules.\nPart 2: Forecasting Healthcare Needs Growth\nInterviewer: The client’s census bureau has printed out some information. What do you make of this?\n\n\n\nAge group\n% of population today\n% of population in 10 years\nAverage healthcare cost per person per year\n\n\n0-21\n20\n10\n$1000\n\n\n22-65\n70\n70\n$500\n\n\n65+\n10\n20\n$4000\n\n\n\nPossible Answer:\nThe candidate should come to the conclusion that the population will be redistributed with a larger percentage becoming older, and thus, costing more money to the healthcare system. This means that it seems like the healthcare spend will increase by an even greater rate than it currently is, which spells bad news for the Luxembourg health minister. It would be helpful to figure out how bad the problem will become.\nInterviewer: Could you figure out how much the country currently spends on health care, and how much they are projecting to spend in 10 years?\nPossible Answer:\nTo calculate current spending, a weighted average of the average spend per citizen can be taken from today’s data. The calculation of future spending needs to factor in change due to shifting demographic as well as the greater number of citizens in the future due to increase in population.\nDo not give the candidate the information about population change unless they ask for it. If they do not realize it and include it in their calculations, guide them to it. The population is currently 1 million, and the census estimates see it growing by 30% in 10 years.\nCalculation of current average spending:\n[ 0.20 (0-21 years) * $1000 + 0.70 (22-65 years) * $500 + 0.10 (65+ years) * $4000 ] * 1 million (population level) = $950M in current spend\nCalculation of future average spending:\nFirst, the population change needs to be taken into effect: (1+30%) * 1M = 1.3M\nNext, this must be incorporated into a weighted average\n[ 0.10 (0-21 years) * $1000 + 0.70 (22-65 years) * $500 + 0.20 (65+ years) * $4000 ] * 1.3 million (population level) = 1.625B in future spend\nFinding out the percent change:\n$1.625B (future spend) – $950M (current spent) = $675M\nDivide $675M by the current spend $950M yields a 71% increase in spending, which is a huge increase. It is also OK if the candidate rounds $950M to $1B and then the percent increase becomes 62.5%, which is equally significant. (Note to Interviewer: Ensure that the candidate calculates the percent change in spending and reacts to it.)\nPart 3: Copayment Idea\nInterviewer: Before we started on this project, the Luxembourg health minister was toying with the idea of beginning a $5 per visit copayment. This would cover all individual visits regardless of specialty. Currently, the average citizen goes through the healthcare system 5 times a year, at an average cost of $50 a visit. What do you think would be the impact of the copayment?\nPossible Answer:\nThe candidate should theorize that first, with $5, the cost would go down to $45, and then also, if the visits are no longer free, patients will be choosier about when they go to the doctor and there will be fewer visits per citizens. When the candidate gets to that point, let them know that the estimate is that there will be 4.5 visits per year as a result. The candidate should now realize, or be coaxed into figuring out what percent of the budget will be saved by this change:\nFirst, the candidate should figure out the current cost to the healthcare system for all of the visits:\n5 (visits per year) * $50 (per visit) * 1M (citizens in the country) = $250M\nThen, under the plan:\n4.5 (visits per year) * $45 (per visit) * 1M (citizens in the country) = $202.5M\nSubtracting the two gets a difference of roughly $50M saved with the copayment, which would reduce the total cost of routine visits by roughly 20% (Make sure the candidate remembers that total health care spending is $950M, so this plan would constitute a 5% reduction off of the total).\nPart 4: Copayment Risks\nInterviewer: Although the copayment seems like a good idea, do you think that there are any risks to the idea? How could those risks be alleviated? Are there any other ideas that come to mind aside from a copayment that could help out the situation?\nPossible Answer:\nHere are some suggestions. Importantly, the candidate should remain structured:\na. Risks:\n• Looking out for the poorest citizens – perhaps they can’t afford the $5 copay. Care should be taken to make sure that it’s affordable for all, and perhaps, there can be a sliding scale based on per capita income.\n• Public unhappiness in response to the copayment – The public will probably be unhappy with this change, which could have political repercussions for the health minister’s party. Perhaps a survey could be taken to gauge how unpopular this idea would be.\n• Will the copayment be enough to affect anyone who may abuse the system – Is $5 enough of a deterrent for people who go to see the doctor for superfluous visits? Perhaps there should also be a sliding scale based on acuity or visit type.\n• Emergency attention – Could the $5 copayment make it difficult to obtain care in an emergency? Perhaps the fee should be waived in emergency situations.\nb. Alternatives to copayment system:\n• Limiting types of visits – Some regulation could be put in place for types of visits that really only need to take place once a year, like eye exams.\n• Increasing spending on preventative care – If people lead healthier lives, they will need less healthcare. More attention could be placed on encouraging preventative care habits for the general population.\nPart 5: Recommendation\nInterviewer: OK, wrapping up, what should we tell the Luxembourg healthcare minister?\nIn this answer, the most important thing is for the candidate to be structured and concise.\nPossible Answer:\nWe’ve looked at the healthcare spending situation, and we estimate that there will be a 70% increase over the next 10 years, driven by two factors\n• Population increase\n• Population aging\nCopayment is a good place to start to immediately address the healthcare spending situation as it could decrease costs this year for starters by roughly 5% from initial estimates. However, more analysis needs to be done to make sure that the copayment will not have adverse effects quality of care delivered, and that it will be politically feasible.\nFrom a long-term perspective, the population’s healthcare needs will grow substantially, and more thought must be taken to figure out how to maintain the system’s sustainability. Initiating visit type regulations and focusing on preventative care are two good places to start to make sure that the healthcare system can continue to meet the needs of the population at a reasonable cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

It is situated in the western area of the North Atlantic and 100 km east of the Windward Islands and the Caribbean Sea. Our client is the CEO of Treasure Island Communications (TIC), a telecommunications company on Barbados Island which has enjoyed a govemment protected monopoly for many years. The client TIC provides mobile services as well as fixed-line services for both intemational and domestic lines.\nIn about a year’s time, the Barbados government will deregulate the telecommunications industry and invite other companies to enter the Barbados market. Our client TIC has engaged McKinsey & Company to discuss ways to deal with this new environment.\nIf the candidate asks: “Why does the Barbados government want to deregulate the telecommunications industry?”\nInterviewer input: “Two main reasons: (1) Government collects more revenues in the form of spectrum licensing fees; (2) More competition will reduce prices which is better for consumers”.\nPossible Solution:\nQuestion 1: Our client TIC would like help in drawing up some possible scenarios. What information would you need in order to flesh out realistic scenarios?\nPossible Answer:\nThe candidate may outline the following high-level issues:\n• Market Size / Structure: Given the market size and the number of customers, is the market more likely to remain a natural monopoly or evolve into a duopoly/oligopoly/monopolistic competition?\n• Characteristics of Potential Competitors: What are their capabilities and which segments (mobile, domestic/international fixed) are they likely to target?\n• Entry Barriers: What entry barriers can TIC use or muster?\nNatural barriers include high set-up costs, high fixed costs, etc.\nArtificial barriers: TIC could lobby government to set higher spectrum-licensing fees etc.\nQuestion 2: Could you tell me more about the financial information on the client TIC that you’d like?\nPossible Answer:\nThe candidate should cover the basics of revenue and cost information. Suggested answers include:\nRevenue: How is pricing done for the different service segments? What are the usage volumes? What are the trends across time?\nCosts: What are the set-up costs, recurring fixed costs, and variable costs?\nQuestion 3: I will give you some data on the international fixed-line services.\nLatest revenue (year 2015) = $90M\nTotal costs = $30M (all annual fixed costs)\nAssume that with new entrants and competition, prices will drop 50% but usage volumes do not change. What market share does TIC need to maintain in order to break even?\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate’s answer should walk through the following logic:\nNew Market Size = 50% * $90M = $45M\nTIC’s break-even revenue = $30M\nTIC’s required Market Share = $30M/$45M = 2/3 = 66.7%\nImplication: the client TIC can afford to lose only 1/3 market share to competition.\nQuestion 4: Let’s use more realistic assumptions this time. Assume that volume of usage does increase when prices fall 50% due to competition. Please take a look at the following data and tell me what you see.

Headquartered in Manhattan, New York City, Citigroup was formed from one of the world’s largest mergers in history by combining the banking giant Citicorp and financial conglomerate Travelers Group in October 1998. As of January 2015, it is the third largest bank holding company in the United States by assets.\nMy most recent case has me working with the credit card division of Citibank. In general, what do you think are some of the sources of revenue for a credit card company like Citibank?\nPossible Answer:\nNote to Interviewer: if the candidate asks, clarify that we are not talking about MasterCard or Visa here, which own the payment network. We are talking about a credit card issuing bank like Citibank, which issues cards and extends credit.\nDon’t let the candidate make a structure.

What are some strategies we could use to grow the quantity of transactions?\nCandidate:\n• Improve marketing conversion rate (may get new people to start using credit cards)\n• Improve the “product”, maybe offer different rewards programs to take share from competitors? This might also cause existing customers to make more purchases.\nInterviewer: I like your idea about improving the product. Let’s say that a cell phone company (e.g. Apple) has approached our client Citibank with a new technology that would allow people to make payments using their cell phones (e.g. Apple Pay). What are some of the things you would want to look at to assess this opportunity?\nCandidate:\na. Profitability\n• Number of customers of the cell-phone company; overlap with our customers\n• Estimated rate of adoption of the technology among customers\n• Revenue / Cost on a per customer basis\nb. Competitive position\n• Who else has this technology or is planning to use it? (cell phone companies, credit card issuers)\nc. Risks\n• Technological (new technology comes along, payment network “standard” fight?)\n• Picking the wrong cell-phone company to partner with\n• Terms of the joint venture: who makes the investments, who reaps the rewards?\nInterviewer:  Wrap it all up for me. What would you tell your client Citibank about this new technology?\nWhen making a final recommendation, the candidate should be concise and take a stand one way or other.\nPossible Answer:\nOur client Citibank should continue to pursue the cell phone technology opportunity. It is a new technology in the U.S. that would give them first-mover advantage, it would help them increase their customer base, and it would also increase the number of transactions per customer, all of which would help increase revenue. As they continue to pursue this, some things they need to be aware of are the market size and adoption rates in the U.S., the ongoing costs, and the competition’s position.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: operations strategy, optimization.\nConsulting Firm: McKinsey & Company 2nd round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: retail.\nCase Interview Question #00893: Our client Loblaws is a major supermarket chain headquartered in Brampton, Canada, with more than 2,000 stores in British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec. Loblaws is a division of Loblaw Companies Limited (TSX: L), Canada’s largest food distributor. The Loblaws stores carry a variety of goods, but the vast  majority of space is devoted to groceries and about a third of each store is set aside for consumer products, housewares, and clothing.\nThe client Loblaws is one of the three major players in this sector and the rest of the market is split amongst smaller, regional chains. About 10 years ago, in January 2005, they introduced a customer loyalty card scheme (run by a third party provider), but have not been able to make this scheme successful. The CEO of Loblaws has called McKinsey & Company in to review their customer loyalty program and suggest ways to improve it.\nPossible Answer:\nPart 1: Overall approach for review\nBehind the scenes: If the candidate asks further questions, you should explain that the customer loyalty card works in the following way: For every $1 spent in store, the customer receives 1 point. These points can be redeemed for discounts at the store. 100 points can be redeemed for a 1% saving on every $100 spent.\nInterviewer: What areas should we investigate to determine the performance of this customer loyalty scheme?\nPossible Answers:\n• What are the goals of the customer loyalty scheme? Profitability? Business intelligence?\n• Benchmark the potential profitability of other customer loyalty card schemes (look at competitors’ schemes or grocery stores in other regions).\n• Compare the profitability of this customer loyalty scheme – is there a gap? If so, why? What drives value for a customer loyalty card scheme? What improvements could be made?\n• Consider alternatives – are there other pricing/promotion/customer loyalty schemes that can match or surpass the loyalty card scheme?\nThe profitability of a customer loyalty card scheme will be determined by\n• Total customers * % customers with loyalty card  * extra profits generated by scheme (per customer)\n• For a given customer, extra profits generated by scheme depend on the increase in the frequency of their visits and the spend per visit.\nPart 2: Cost structure\nBehind the scenes: the candidate should keep in mind that the customer loyalty program is run by a third party provider.\nInterviewer: What are the costs associated with running a customer loyalty card program?\nPossible Answers:\n• Discounts (largest cost)\n• Software upgrades to registers\n• Promotion of scheme\n• Customer support\n• Printing cards, maintaining data, etc – this will likely be borne by the third party provider and paid for on some kind of rate (e.g. per customer)\nPart 3: Customer loyalty card vs. non-loyalty card transactions\nNote to Interviewer: The candidate should bear in mind that the value they are calculating is on a per transaction, not a per customer, basis. Pause after question (a) below to allow them to talk before asking question (b). Before doing the calculation in (b), the candidate should request the total number of transactions. The total number of transactions is 10 million.\nInterviewer: We received this data from the client Loblaws. (a) How would you interpret it? (b) Can you calculate the average revenue per transaction for loyalty card holders and for customers who do not hold a loyalty card?\nExhibit 1. Transaction data for loyalty card holders and non-loyalty card holders\n\nPossible Answer:\n(a) A lot of transactions involve customers who do not have a loyalty card. This suggests that there may be a lot of customers do not know about the customer loyalty scheme (there is potential to grow it). However, this data tells us nothing about the number of customers with the card, simply the number of transactions.\nIf we look at the relative percentages it looks like loyalty card holders spend more per transaction. However, this could imply one of two things: (1) Customers who shop a lot at this chain are more likely to get the customer loyalty card and make the most of the discounts, OR (2) the card encourages customers to spend more each visit. There is insufficient data to determine causality.\n(b) Spend per transaction = (Total money spend * % spend) / (Total number of transactions * % transactions)\nFor loyalty customer transactions, spend per transaction = ($300MM * 40%) /(10MM * 1/3) = $36/transaction\nFor non-loyalty customer transactions, spend per transaction = ($300MM * 60%) / (10MM * 2/3) = $27/transaction\nWhat might explain this? This could be because the non-loyalty customers are not regular customers – they may be buying things like newspapers, milk, and other small purchases. Loyalty card customers are more likely to be doing a regular trip and may purchase more items in stores where they have discount schemes.\nPart 4: Are customers really loyal?\nBehind the scenes: Show the interviewee the following bar chart:\nExhibit 2. Number of customer loyalty cards in wallet\n\nInterviewer: We interviewed customers in-store and asked them how many supermarket loyalty cards they had in their wallet. We found out that the distribution was bimodal. What does this information tell you?\nPossible Answers:\nMost customers either have no loyalty cards, or have cards for three supermarkets (probably our client and the other two major players). This suggests that loyalty cards do not in fact encourage loyalty to a particular supermarket chain. There is a portion of customers who do not care or aren’t informed about the customer loyalty scheme. The rest will carry a card for each supermarket and use the appropriate card wherever they go.\nKey take-away: Customer loyalty cards will probably not determine where someone shops, but can affect what products, and how much, they buy at your store. The program should reflect this, e.g. by offering bonus points on high-margin products.\nPart 5: Wrap-up\nBehind the scenes: there are several ways that this data could be interpreted, so accept any reasonable answer that is well structured.\nInterviewer: What would you recommend to the CEO of Loblaws?\nPossible Answers:\n• There is potential to grow the customer loyalty scheme, so run promotion campaigns to enroll more card members.\n• Give additional loyalty “points” for high-margin products.\n• Restructure customer loyalty card formula to give dollar-amount discounts on particular (high-margin) items to steer customers towards those items.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "url": "http://www.consultingcase101.com/evanston-supermarket-to-add-pharmacy-corner-in-store/",
        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new business.\nConsulting Firm: Bain & Company first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: small business; retail.\nCase Interview Question #00884: Your friend from business school owns and runs a single supermarket in the town of Evanston. Evanston is a suburban city in Cook County, Illinois, United States, just 12 miles north of downtown Chicago, bordered by Chicago to the south, Skokie to the west, and Wilmette to the north. Evanston is the home  of Northwestern University.\nYour friend’s supermarket currently sells grocery and consumer products only, and does not have a pharmacy. He is considering setting up a pharmacy corner in his store (show the following Exhibit 1 to the candidate) to sell prescription drugs. He has approached you to ask for advice. What do you think? Should your friend add a pharmacy to his supermarket? Why, or why not?\nPossible Answer:\nNote: A strong candidate will ask about the goals of the investment as well as the capital constraints. If asked, advise the candidate that the goal of the investment is to increase profitability and that your friend is quite capital constrained right now, thereby requiring a payback period of two years.\nExhibit 1. Proposed pharmacy corner in supermarket\n\nInterviewer: To begin, why don’t you think about what information you might need for the analysis?\nNote: The candidate should now draw up an approach that, at a minimum, includes market analysis, profitability (profits = revenues – fixed and variable costs), and execution strategy if investment is viable. (after ～1 minute)\nCandidate: I would like to approach the problem by first understanding what the market for prescription drugs in the city or the neighborhood of the supermarket looks like, then estimating the profitability of the operations to determine whether it meets the investment criteria, and lastly look at execution strategies and associated risks if the investment does satisfy the criteria.\nTo approach the problem along these three dimensions, I would specifically need the following information about the market:\n• Population of the city/neighborhood the supermarket is serving\n• Its growth rate\n• The present number of shoppers in the supermarket\n• Other pharmacies in the area and their share of the market.\nTo estimate the profitability of the operations, I would like to find out:\n• The fraction of people in the city/neighborhood who take prescription drugs.\n• What is their monthly expenditure? This would help me calculate the expected revenues.\n• An estimate of the initial investment needed to cover the fixed expenses.\n• The costs associated with running the pharmacy.\nPart 1: Profitability of the pharmacy\nInterviewer: That seems like a good list. Where would you like to start?\nNote: At this point make sure that the candidate begins by looking at the market. If he/she starts jumping to profitability, ask them to first analyze the market since it may be a logical first step in estimating overall profitability.\nCandidate: I would like to begin by looking at the market. Do we know where the supermarket is located and what the population is of the area it is serving?\nInterviewer: The supermarket is located in a suburb. The suburb has a population of around 50,000. The population has more or less remained constant for the past decade.\nCandidate: Does my friend’s supermarket cater to the entire population or do people shop elsewhere as well?\nInterviewer: The supermarket in question on average gets 10,000 customers per month which results in monthly sales of $1 million.\nCandidate: How many pharmacies are located in this suburban area?\nInterviewer: There are 3 pharmacies within a two mile radius. These are the only pharmacies in the suburb.\nCandidate: How do these pharmacies compare against each other?\nInterviewer: They are all similar to each other, and someone looking for prescription drugs can go to any of these stores.\nCandidate: Okay, I think I understand. Allow me to estimate if the pharmacy can be run profitably or not. Is there any market data available that might tell us how many people take prescription drugs in the suburb and what their average monthly spend on drugs is?\nInterviewer: There is no study specific for the suburb. But on an average, 50% of U.S. population takes prescription drugs. The monthly drug bills are $50/person.\nCandidate: I will assume that the usage trends of the population of this suburb are no different than the usage of the rest of the U.S. population. So we have a total of 25,000 people (50,000 * 50%) which translates to total prescription drug sales in the suburb of $1.25M/month (25,000 customers * $50/customer/month).\nThe supermarket my friend runs already attracts 10,000 shoppers which means that 5,000 (50%) of them are likely to purchase prescription drugs. If the shoppers have no preference for one pharmacy over the other then those who have to buy drugs may as well buy them from the pharmacy in the supermarket. In addition, there is a potential to attract a fraction of the remaining 20,000 people in the suburb to purchase prescription drugs at the supermarket rather than going to one of the other three pharmacies.\nInterviewer: I like where you are going. Let us focus on the store’s existing customers.\nCandidate: Let me calculate the revenue my friend can earn by selling drugs to the existing customers.\nRevenue = Number of customers * Percentage requiring prescription drugs * Average spend = 10,000 * 50% * $50/month = $250,000 per month\nNext I will need to estimate the cost of the initial investment as well as the costs associated with operations. I imagine that the bulk of the variable costs will be related to the drugs themselves whereas the primary fixed costs will be the pharmacists salaries and a little bit of overhead. Do we know what these costs are?\nInterviewer: I like your structure. I know that the pharmacy corner is expected to run at 10% profit margin and would require an upfront investment of $400,000.\nCandidate: This information will allow me to calculate the payback period.\nPayback period = Initial investment / Operating profit = $400,000 / ($250,000 * 10%) = 16 months.\nClearly this falls well within the 24 month payback window my friend is looking at making the investment viable.\nNote: A prudent candidate will recognize that there may be challenges associated with getting all of their current customers who purchase prescription drugs to purchase them at the supermarket.\nPart 2: Effect on the overall profitability of the supermarket.\nInterviewer: Your friend is excited to hear this. He then asks you about the other potential benefits of opening up the pharmacy apart from the profitability that comes with the drug sales?\nCandidate: As I mentioned earlier, the pharmacy can attract other customers to our supermarket who were shopping at other pharmacies until now. When they come to the supermarket, they can also make purchases of other products in the store.\nNote: In this part of the interview, the interviewer wants the candidate to focus on additional purchases made when the customers are waiting for the drugs. If necessary, lead the candidate in this direction.\nInterviewer: OK. Another supermarket reported that sales (excluding drugs) went up 30% when it opened a pharmacy. What do you think this may be due to?\nCandidate: Drug purchase would force the customers to spend more time in the store. So while they are waiting for their prescriptions to be filled, customers may be inclined to make impulse purchases of other products.  For our friend, this offers additional opportunity for increased profits.\nIncremental Sales = Total customers * Percentage buying drugs * Average monthly spend per customer * 30%\n= 10,000 * 50% * ($1M/10,000) * 0.3 = $150,000/month\nDo we have information about the profit margins on the grocery and other products sold at the supermarket?\nInterviewer: I do not know the margins, but the supermarket has the following cost structure for every dollar of sales:\n• Fixed cost = $0.15\n• Cost of goods sold (COGS) = $0.75\n• Salary of staff = $0.05\nNote: Candidate should recognize that only the COGS (variable costs) are relevant in this case since the grocery store will not need to increase fixed costs to sustain the incremental sales.\nCandidate: I think the only relevant cost for calculating incremental profitability is COGS. The fixed costs will be incurred regardless. Also, if the additional sales do not require an increase in the number of employees, then the staff salary costs remain unchanged.\nSo we are looking at a profit margin of 25% which means additional profitability of $37,500/month ($150,000 * 0.25) from the additional sales. This increased profitability will reduce the payback period even further making the investment even more attractive.\nNote: The candidate may choose to calculate the new payback period but it is not necessary. At this point is should be obvious that opening up a pharmacy corner is a good decision IF you can at least get your current customers to purchase their prescription drugs at the supermarket.\nPart 3: Execution strategies\nInterviewer: Good. So what should your friend do to get customers to purchase drugs at the pharmacy in his supermarket?\nNote: This question can have many possible answers. Just make sure that the strategies recommended are practical. Some possibilities include: customer loyalty programs such as membership card, promotions,\nadvertising, etc.\nInterviewer: Good! Do you have any questions for me? (This case does not require a final recommendation)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: improve profitability.\nConsulting Firm: McKinsey & Company 1st round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: restaurant & food service.\nCase Interview Question #00885: Our client Ruby Tuesday Inc. (NYSE: RT) is an American multinational foodservice retailer that owns, operates, and franchises a number of fast food restaurant brands. They are headquartered in Maryville, Tennessee, and operate more than 700 locations worldwide between their various concepts.\nThe majority of Ruby Tuesday’s fast food restaurants are on the East coast. 40% of their restaurants are located in service centers on highways, often in clusters of three to five. The client Ruby Tuesday has recorded astounding growth historically. In the past five years, however, costs have been increasing and revenues declining. Your consulting firm has been hired to determine how to address the problem. What would you do?\nPossible Answer:\nNote: This is a interviewer-led “pressure” case. Do not allow the candidate to formulate a structure. Rather than deliberating and answering, the candidate should be pushed to answer quickly.\nInterviewer: Let’s start with a simple question related to costs. In 2014, our cost structure was 20% Property, Plant And Equipment (PP&E), 20% labor, 30% Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), and 30% miscellaneous. In 2015, PP&E has doubled, labor has stayed the same, COGS has dropped by two thirds (due to the use of beef substitutes) and SG&A has tripled. What percent of our cost structure is labor in 2015?\nCandidate: Consider the problem in absolute values rather than percents. PP&E moves from $20 to $40, labor remains at $20, COGS changes from $30 to $10, and SG&A shifts from $30 to $90. The new “total cost” is $40+$20+$10+$90 = $160 now. Labor ($20) is 12.5% of $160.\nNote: If the candidate cannot answer the question, remain silent for ten seconds. And then offer minimal clues. If the candidate produces the correct answer, ask him/her if he/she is sure. Force the candidate to declare he/she is sure before moving on.\nInterviewer: OK. Let’s forget about costs. Let’s talk about revenues. Over the past fifteen years, the number of fast food restaurants owned and operated by the client has declined by 20%. Why do you think this is?\nCandidate: Possible answers include: consolidation, changing demographics that do not cater to fast food consumption, or the emergence of other low cost options stealing share.\nInterviewer: Even more concerning, in addition to fewer storefronts, our client’s revenues have declined by 30%. Take a look at the table below and tell me what you think. These are our four most prominent restaurant brands.\n\n\n\nJen’s Fresh Burger\nMiguel’s Big Taco\nNate’s Fat Dogs\nRya’s Gourmet Pizza Pie\n\n\n# of stores (2014)\n16\n 28\n 20\n20\n\n\n# of stores (2015)\n12\n 24\n 20\n12\n\n\nThe candidate should see that while the total number of stores has declined, some stores have fared better than others. Notably, Nate’s Fat Dogs has maintained the same number of stores. The candidate should surmise that the new mix of storefronts may account for the more precipitous drop in revenue (when compared with the decline in store fronts). That is, some stores generate more revenue than others. If the candidate does not see that store mix is key, prompt him/her.\nInterviewer: Yeah, you’re right about that. Rya’s Gourmet Pizza Pie generated the most cash when compared against the other restaurants. Why do you think this is?\nPossible answers include higher average revenue per sale or a higher number of sales.\nInterviewer: Actually both. We found that although customers spent more time eating in Rya’s than any other restaurant, later hours more than compensated. So why do you think the client closed storefronts rather than opening them?\nThe candidate should first note that high revenues are distinct from high profits. It could be the case that costs increased disproportionately. If the candidate does not realize this, prompt him/her.\nInterviewer: What costs do you think were most relevant?\nThe candidate should recall the changing cost structure for all the stores. Although Rya’s is only one brand within the portfolio, the candidate should ask about PP&E and SG&A.\nInterviewer: Actually PP&E costs were quite high. Rya’s uses an unusual type of coal oven capable of cooking pizzas very quickly. The service on the ovens was extremely expensive and they broke down all the time. Abruptly ask the candidate: how many pizzas do you think Rya’s prepares on a daily basis?\nThis is a generic market sizing and estimation question that can be approached in any number of ways. One approach is to begin with the number of restaurants in the chain, number of customers drawn by each (which will vary based on the day of the week and the number of individuals traveling on highways) and then speculate what fraction of a pizza each customer buys.\nInterviewer: Great. Thanks for coming in! No formal recommendation is necessary.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new business; investment.\nConsulting Firm: McKinsey & Company first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: railroads & trains; transportation.\nCase Interview Question #00886: The national railway company of Spain (RENFE, acronym of Red Nacional de los Ferrocarriles Españoles—National Network of Spanish Railways), a former monopoly, is now opening to competition. On January 1, 2005, RENFE was divided into two separate companies: RENFE-Operadora (train operations) and ADIF (Administrador de Infraestructuras Ferroviarias—Railway Infrastructure Administration, a company that manages the tracks, train stations and traffic control).\nA friend of yours has just inherited $100 million and has approached you for advice on starting a new train operation company to compete against the new RENFE-Operadora. In particular, he wants to start by opening a new high speed train route between Madrid and Barcelona (621 kilometers or 386 miles). Should your friend go ahead and launch the new business?\nPossible Answer:\nPart 1: Industry Overview\nBehind the scenes: Let the candidate to lay out his/her framework and start brainstorming about the current situation in the industry: competitors, and competitive situation. Give the following information when asked the proper question. Let him or her focus on competition, and the differences between this new venture and the competition.\nAdditional Information:\nMain competitors: RENFE and air travel. Evaluate price, time and convenience\nUs vs. RENFE:\n\nWe are less expensive.\nWe are more efficiently run (as a former monopoly, RENFE is very inefficient!)\nEqual travel time.\nWe are equally convenient (same stations and tracks).\n\nUs vs. air travel:\n\nWe are less expensive than air travel.\nEqually efficient.\nHigh speed train takes slightly longer than air travel.\nWe are more convenient (no need to travel to/from the airport)\n\nKey Insight: As a result of this high-level analysis, it is possible that we have a chance in this market. Now let’s evaluate profitability.\nPart 2: Business Overview\nInterviewer: Now that we have identified the main issues in the market, it is time to see whether we can be profitable. How would you evaluate the viability of your friend’s business? What do you think the main costs and revenue streams are?\nPossible Answers:\nPossible forms of revenues: tickets (main revenue driver), ads in trains, food and drinks, and any others are good for the brainstorming but should be ignored for the calculations.\nCosts: Marketing, Operations and maintenance, trains, personnel, IT, etc.\nInterviewer: Great. Now, before moving on let me tell you about operations. You can travel by high-speed train between Madrid and Barcelona in under 3 hours. Trains run from 8 am until 10 pm. Taking into account all different factors, we can run two round trips per day. We will need three trains, as well as one for backup in case of breakdown, i.e. total 4 trains and 4 trips per day.\nPart 3: Break even Calculations\nInterviewer: What do you need to calculate expected profits? Keep in mind that the company only has 10 years to pay back the investment.\nBehind the scenes: The candidate should ask specifically for all the costs needed.\nAdditional Information:\n• Trains: $30M per train (tell the candidate to think of this only at the end)\n• Marketing: $15M per year\n• Operations/Maintenance: $10M per year\nTrain fares: Trains have a capacity of 500 people\n• If tickets cost $40, then 95% occupancy\n• If tickets cost $50, then 80% occupancy\n• If tickets cost $60, then 60% occupancy\nInterviewer: Given this data, how much do you think the tickets should cost?\nCandidate:\n• $40: (0.95 * 500) * $40 = $19,000 per trip\n• $50: (0.8 * 500) * $50 = $20,000 per trip\n• $60: (0.6 * 500) * $60 = $18,000 per trip\nKey Insight: It is most profitable to set prices at $50.\nInterviewer: Now figure out the profits per year (assuming above costs are per train)\nCalculations:\n$20,000 per trip * 4 trips per day * 365 days = $29.2M in revenue per year\n$29.2M – $25M (marketing and operations) = $4.2M profit per year per train\nBecause we on average operate only 3 trains we disregard the costs in operations and maintenance for the fourth train. Total estimated operating profit is therefore $4.2 * 3 = $12.6M.\nKey Insight: This does not look great – it would take almost 10 years to recoup the $120M investment in 4 trains.\nRecommendations\nInterviewer: What would you recommend your friend? What options could you consider to make the business more profitable?\nPossible Answer:\nHe should not invest under the current circumstances, but may also explore options such as leasing trains, additional revenue from onboard sales and advertising, joint venture (JV) with a foreign operator with excess capacity, etc. (ask for brainstorming ideas)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: business turnaround; increase revenue.\nConsulting Firm: McKinsey & Company first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: leisure & recreation; non-profit organization.\nCase Interview Question #00887: Our client Neue Galerie New York is a small art museum located in the William Starr Miller House at 86th Street and Fifth Avenue in New York City. Established in 2001, it is one of the most recent additions to New York City’s famed Museum Mile. Neue Galerie New York specializes in 17th and 18th century European art, especially German and Austrian art and design.\nThe collection of the Neue Galerie is divided into two sections. The second floor of the museum houses works of fine art and decorative art from 17th and 18th century Austria. The third floor exhibits various German works from the same era. They usually put $150,000 into a fund every year, with money in the fund going towards various future expenses. Last year, however, revenues decreased, and the client could only put 50% of what they normally put into the fund. They have asked McKinsey to figure out how to turn this around. What would you suggest?\nPossible Solution: \nQuestion 1: What are some potential reasons for this decrease?\nPossible Answers:\nLay out revenue sources: membership fees, museum admission fees, sponsorships/grants\nPossible sources of revenue decrease:\n• Membership fees: lapsed renewals, reduced number of new members.\n• Admission fees: lower visitor volume, increased competition from other museums.\n• Sponsorships/grants: budget crunches in sponsor organizations.\nQuestion 2: If we lower the membership fee by 20%, what is the increase in membership volume needed to bring the fund’s annual deposit back to its original levels?\nAdditional Information: (to be provided upon request)\n• Assume, as a simplification, that all revenues come from membership fees\n• Current membership fee is $150/year\n• 25% of membership fee is used to cover costs (Candidate should deduce that this means that 75% of each membership fee is put into the fund)\nPossible Answer:\nWith current membership fee ($150/year), current number of members = (50% * $150K) / (75% * $150) = 667\nWith future membership fee = 80% * $150/year = $120/year,\nAmount per member entering the fund = 75% * $120/year = $90\nNumber of members required for annual deposit of $150K into fund = $150K/$90 = 1,667\nTherefore, required increase in membership = 1,667 – 667 = 1,000\nKey insight: 1,000 new members are needed for the membership fee reduction to be sufficient in helping us achieve our revenue goal.\nQuestion 3: What do you think of that?\nPossible Answer:\nIt is hard to imagine that a mere 20% drop in membership price will cause member numbers to more than double (from 667 to 1667). This strategy cannot stand alone.\nQuestion 4: What are the pros and cons of this strategy?\nPossible Answer:\nPros: Low cost strategy; if successful in increasmg membership strength, this strategy will lead to sustainable revenue increases (recurring renewal fees, other complementary revenue streams like sales of special tickets or merchandise to members and discounted rates driving volume sales etc.)\nCons: Risky; if demand for memberships is price-inelastic, it can backfire horribly. Also, certain beneficiaries/donors of the museum may be strongly opposed to a low-cost strategy.\nQuestion 5: What other strategies can the museum employ?\nPossible Answer:\nRevisit original structure. Suggested answers include: revisit each alternative revenue source in a systematic fashion, and lay out ways to boost revenue and therefore annual deposits into that fund.\na. Membership fees\n• Investigate real source of reduced membership revenues.\n• Are new members’ joining rate declining? If so, boost advertising for new members (and increase perks which are low-cost), without necessarily lowering fees.\n• Are existing members letting their memberships lapse? Release early bird renewal specials, to encourage more renewals.\nb. Admission fees\n• Analyze visitor patterns, and employ creative promotion and price discrimination strategies (e.g. weekend special rates, family specials, co-promotions with other museums or nearby entertainment/restaurant spots)\n• Boost other revenues associated with admission, such as food and merchandise sales on museum premises. Improve gift shop and cafeteria operations to attract more dollars.\nc.

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: market entry; market sizing.\nConsulting Firm: Siemens Management Consulting (SMC) first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: consumer electronics, home appliances.\nCase Interview Question #00888: Our client Robert Bosch GmbH, or Bosch, is a German multinational engineering and electronics company headquartered in Gerlingen, near Stuttgart, Germany. Bosch’s core products are automotive components (including brakes, controls, electrical drives, electronics, fuel systems, generators, starter motors and steering systems), industrial products (including drives and controls, packaging technology and consumer goods) and building products (including household appliances, power tools, security systems and thermo-technology).\nOur client Bosch is well known for their high-quality, German-made household appliances such as refrigerator, washing machines, dryers. Recently, the management of Bosch is thinking of expanding into the Chinese market with their washing machines, specifically in Shanghai. They have hired Siemens Management Consulting to find out if they should, and if so, how they should do it.\nPossible Answer:\nPart 1: Market Sizing & Background \nBehind the scenes: A large part of this “market entry” case will be market sizing, which should be reflected in the interviewee’s written structure. Tell him or her that this is what the first part of the case will focus on. The introduction part of the case didn’t give much information, so the interviewee should drive the information-discovery part of the case by asking proper questions.\nOne of the first things the interviewee should think about is the washing machine market in terms of products. If this doesn’t happen naturally, then prompt the discussion. There are three sub-markets: residential washing machines, washing machines for laundromats (which are somewhat similar to residential ones), and commercial washing machines (such as you’d find in a hotel basement). Once this point has been covered, say that Bosch is not looking at the commercial market for these products. So, we’re focusing on in-home and laundromats.\nInterviewer: What are some facts and numbers we need to know in order to estimate this market?\nPossible Answers:\nThere are multiple way of doing a basic market sizing exercise here, but make sure the interviewee is clear about what data is necessary, makes appropriate assumptions, and explains the reasoning behind each assumption (the following are necessary).\n• The population of Shanghai: 24 million people, as of 2015. (This is the one number that is fixed and which the interviewer should give)\n• Number of people per household: about 4\n• How do people do laundry? Pretend that there is an even split between in-home washing machines, going to the laundromats, and doing laundry by hand. So, there are 33%, or 8 million people for each option. This translates into 2 million households in Shanghai for each option.\nPart 2: Calculations of Market Opportunity\nBehind the scenes: Prompt each step of the math problem, but let the interviewee go through the equations himself/herself.\nInterviewer: Now that you have gone through the total market for each type of washing machine, let’s look at each one individually. Bosch is thinking of selling these machines for $500 each. From this, figure out the market opportunity in dollars.\nPossible Answer:\nA. In-home machines:\n$500 * 2 million households = $1 billion\nKey Insight: Washing machines are durable goods and people don’t buy washing machines very often. The interviewee should estimate somewhere between every 5 and 10 years for a new purchase. If we take 10 years, then: $1 billion / 10 years = $100 million to be made each year from the residential market.\nB. Laundromats:\nBehind the scenes: Let the interviewee make assumptions about the following categories that pertain to laundromat use as a way of estimating how much money Bosch could potentially make from this market every year. Give the interviewee the answer to the following questions if he/she asks:\n• How many times per week does a household visit a laundromat? 1 time (give this information only if the interviewee asks for it)\n• How many washing machines are in a laundromat? 20 machines\n• How many loads does the family wash in each trip? 3 loads\n• How long does one load take? 1 hour\n• How many hours is the laundromat open for each day? 10 hours\nThe interviewee should now go through the exercise of calculating the dollar value of each market. If the interviewee is stuck, you can ask one or more of the following questions to give them a hint:\n(1) How many families are customers at each laundromat?\n20 machines / 3 loads per family at 1 load per hour = about 7 families per hour\n7 families per hour * 10 hours/day * 7 days per week = 490 families per week –> round to 500 families per week per laundromat\n(2) How many laundromats are there in Shanghai?\nIf 2 million households use them, and each one has a capacity of 500 households per week, then there need to be 2 million / 500 = 4,000 laundromats in the city of Shanghai.\n(3) How many laundry machines are in laundromats in Shanghai?\nSince we said there are 20 washing machines per laundromat, 20 machines * 4,000 laundromats = 80,000 machines in laundromats in Shanghai.\n(4) How many machines are purchased per year?:\nThe interviewee should take note of the fact that these machines are being run constantly, and that therefore, the same assumption of 10 years used in the residential calculations won’t work here, because these will wear out a lot faster. For example, the interviewee could say that laundromats buy new washing machines every 4 years.\n80,000 / 4 = 20,000 washing machines are purchased by laundromats every year.\n(5) How much revenue can the client Bosch make per year in this market?\n$500 (assume same price as households) * 20,000 machines = $10 million per year in the laundromat market\nBehind the scenes: Make sure the interviewee tells you what he or she thinks of the numbers. Are they logical and reasonable? How much of this market does he/she think Bosch could capture and why? A good candidate should also say something about Shanghai in particular.\nKey points are: (a) the city is growing rapidly, (b) there are a lot of poor people, (c) the number of wealthy people is also growing, (d) the housing situation in Shanghai is not the same as many Western cities and perhaps apartments are not properly wired for washing machines, etc.\nPart 3: Costs and Marketing Considerations\nBehind the scenes: Now that the interviewee has figured out the market potential for the two sub-segments, turn the attention to other considerations so that he or she can really decide if this is a good opportunity for this company.\nInterviewer: So, what do you think of this opportunity for our German appliance company? What do you think might be challenges and positives in this idea?\nPossible Answer:\nHere are some problems that the interviewee should come up with:\nShipping: washing machines are very heavy, and shipping costs will be high. Also, the Bosch company is in Germany, and Shanghai is halfway around the world. The interviewee should remember that the brand is based on high-quality German engineering, so building a new plant in China to circumvent the shipping costs will be not only expensive for this potentially risky venture, but also water down the value proposition.\nSales: How would the sales force be built? The interviewee should ask if Bosch already has a sales network and presence in China that they could tap into, or if sales departments and relationships would have to be built from scratch.\nAs a last consideration, ask the interviewee how he/she thinks Bosch should market the product, if they decide to go for it? How should they appeal to both the residential customers and laundromat owners?\nRecommendation\nThis is probably not the best idea for the client Bosch. It’s risky. The market estimations are rather high and the overall market size modest given the number of poor people in Shanghai. The shipping logistics are expensive. Establishing a brand in China may also not be easy for Bosch.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new product, new technology.\nConsulting Firm: Schlumberger Business Consulting (SBC) first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: oil, gas, petroleum industry.\nCase Interview Question #00855: The client Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) is an American multinational oil and gas corporation headquartered in Irving, Texas. It was formed in 1999 by the merger of Exxon (formerly Standard Oil Company of New Jersey) and Mobil (formerly the Standard Oil Company of New York). The company is one of the “Big Five” oil companies (Exxon Mobil, BP, Chevron Corporation, Royal Dutch Shell, and ConocoPhillips Company) in the U.S.\nAs an integrated oil and gas company, Exxon Mobil engages in the exploration, production, refinement and distribution of oil and gas, and controls the entire supply chain from oil wells to gas stations. Recently, researchers and scientists in Exxon Mobil have discovered a new automobile fuel that will increase car mileage by 30%. It will also cost 10% more to produce the fuel. The fuel is similar to the old fuel in every other way.\nWhat should Exxon Mobil do with the new fuel?\nAdditional Information: to be provided to candidate after relevant questions\nThere are 5 major players in the industry, including our client: Exxon Mobil, BP, Chevron Corporation, Royal Dutch Shell, and ConocoPhillips Company. They all have equal market share.\nThe interviewer asked me to guesstimate what the demand would be like. One approach – the population of the U.S is about 300M, with 3 people to a household, that makes it 100M households. With one car to a household, it makes it 100M cars. At 20 gallons per week, the weekly demand is about 2,000M, or 2 Billion gallons/week.\nNo special environment concerns or advantages from the new fuel.\nUnder no circumstances can the client Exxon Mobil capture more than 10% of the market due to capacity constraint.\nMargins on old automobile fuel are 10%.\nComplication if the interview is going well:\nWhat if there were two distinct markets? – The private sector and the Government? Assume that the government buys 10% of the total market capacity and buys equally from all 5 players. Should you sell only to the government? What effect would it have on prices?\nPossible Solution:\nNote to the interviewer or case giver: The case per se does not have a conclusive solution; it is intended to test the ability of the interviewee to integrate and look at different issues with the same case. Some of the specific issues that I got to discus in my interview are listed below.\nThe basic framework I laid out at the beginning was to say that I would go through the various issues of\n• Demand issues\n• Capacity issues\n• Internal issues – whether we could produce it on same machinery, same channel, etc.\n• Analyze competition\n• Environmental issues\n• Alternate uses of fuel\nSome key issues that were covered in the interview:\nPricing: how should they price the fuel? (There is no specific information on prices of existing fuels) but relative to the old fuel, what should be the price of the new fuel?\nWhat would be the margins from the new fuel? Assume that the margins on the old fuel are 10%. Then, the margins would be about 24% on the new fuel. This can be arrived at through the following steps:\n• Old fuel price: $1\n• Cost of old fuel: $0.90\n• Gross Margin: 10%\n• New fuel price: $1.30 (since it gives 30% more mileage)\n• Cost of new fuel: $0.99 (since it is 10% more expensive to produce)\n• Gross Margin: $1.30 – $0.99 = $0.31, ~24%\nWhat kind of elasticity would auto fuel have?\nHow do you think competition would retaliate to your suggested price of the new fuel?\nThey could retaliate by lowering prices on the old fuel. Then the question would be how much lower? I used break even theory and said they would drop price until they were only covering variable costs.\nAlternately, with the capacity constraint that the client has, competition need not bother lowering prices. Hence, instead of losing margins on their bread and butter, competition could avoid a price war. With higher gross margins, the only player that could win a price war would be the client.\nAny price movement (either priced higher or priced lower) caused due to the new fuel?\nHow would the competition price the old fuel if the new fuel were priced at just higher than the old fuel?\nWhat if there were two distinct markets? – The private sector and the Government? Assume that the government buys 10% of the total market capacity and buys equally from all players. Should you sell only to the government? What effect would it have on prices?\nA good answer here would be that – it would be very sensible to sell to the government alone since this would negate the possibility of any price war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new business; reduce cost.\nConsulting Firm: Schlumberger Business Consulting (SBC) first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: oil, gas, petroleum industry.\nCase Interview Question #00854: Your client Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA, Petroleum of Venezuela) is the Venezuelan state owned oil and natural gas company. It has activities in exploration, production, refining and exporting oil, as well as exploration and production of natural gas. Since its founding in 1976 with the nationalization of the Venezuelan oil industry, PDVSA has dominated the oil industry of Venezuela, the world’s fifth largest oil exporter.\nThe client PDVSA owns the rights to explore an offshore oil reserve in Venezuela. The oil reserve is good to exploit for 20 years. The production from a single oil well will go up in the beginning, reach its peak, and then decline in its useful life. So in order to keep the production level stable, they need to drill new wells during the reserve exploration process. This makes their return on capital goes down.\nThe client PDVSA currently spend USD $100M per year on oil rig (every oil well needs a rig). They purchase oil rig from USA. USA has higher labor cost than Venezuela. So the client is thinking should they take this opportunity to build their own oil rigs, and if it is proper to do so, how should they utilize this opportunity?\nAdditional Information: to be provided to candidate after relevant questions \nAn oil rig is a piece of very heavy equipment, weighing thousands of tons. Besides USA, currently there is no other place to purchase oil rig.\nThe market demand of oil rig is around $1000M annually, and USA rig manufactures are able to satisfy the needs.\nOil rig companies in USA are making a profit margin around 5%.\n50% cost of rig manufacturing is labor related, including wages, benefits, and overhead. It takes US manufactures 1M man hour to produce one oil rig. Labor related costs in USA are $50 per hour. It includes three components:\n(1) wage: $25 per hour\n(2) benefit: $10 per hour\n(3) overhead $15 per hour.\nLabor related cost in Venezuela is $20 per hour:\n(1) wage: $5 per hour\n(2) benefit: $2 per hour\n(3) overhead $13 per hour.\nInitial investment required to manufacture oil rig in Venezuela is $50M.\nIn order to evaluate how much it costs to manufacture rig locally, we asked three local companies to bid. They all come up with the same proposal, in which labor related cost is charged as $25 per hour.\nMaterial costs are the same in both countries.\nKey information to reveal when questioned:\nThe oil rig manufacturers in Venezuela will experience a learning curve. In the first year, it takes 3M man hours to produce one oil rig, and in the second year it takes 2M man hours. After that, the learning curve goes flat at 1M man hours.\nPossible Solution:\nCandidate: I will look at how attractive the business of producing oil rig is. Then I will look at capability to manufacture rig locally. Finally, I will look at how to pursue the opportunity, if appropriate.\nFirst, I will explore whether the low labor cost in Venezuela is a proper opportunity to pursue. The ultimate standard is whether pursuing the opportunity will bring our client cost saving so that they improve their return on capital.\nProjected cash flows from producing oil rigs locally are:\n\n\n\nYear\nCost Savings\n\n\n0\n-$50M (initial investment)\n\n\n1\n$50*1M (USA) – $25*3M (Venezuela) = -$25M\n\n\n2\n$50*1M (USA) – $25*2M (Venezuela) = 0\n\n\n3\n$50*1M (USA) – $25*1M (Venezuela) = $25M\n\n\n4\n$25M\n\n\n5\n$25M\n\n\n…\n$25M\n\n\n\nI want to do a net present value (NPV) analysis. What is the cost of capital?\nInterviewer: Well, let’s just look at pay back. How many years are needed to pay the initial investment back?\nCandidate: The minimum payback time is that the selling price still maintains at the current market price level, so the rig manufacturers harvest all labor related cost savings and pass none to their customers. In this scenario the cost savings is the projected cash flow the company can achieve. (Notice that the US rig manufacturers’ profit margin is 5%). The payback time is 5 years.\nInterviewer: Well, 5 years pay back sounds like a risky business to get into. Local companies may not have enough incentive to get into the rig business. How do you shorten the pay back time?\nCandidate: Since this will benefit local labor market, we can get the Venezuelan government involved, ask them to provide fund or provide debt guarantee to lower the cost of borrowing. Since we will benefit from the cost saving, we can sign long term contract, for example, 20 years with local supplier. We can also use our network in oil and gas business world and help them supply oil rig to other oil and gas companies.\nInterviewer: Is there anything you can think of to accelerate the payback time by lowering labor cost?\nCandidate: What we can do is to introduce expertise, such as senior engineers, project management, from USA manufactures. This will also accelerate their learning curve.\nInterviewer: Anything else? (The interviewer pushed me hard on the cost issue)\nCandidate: Well, I can look more detailed into labor related cost. Since the cost we used in our estimation is from bidding. I want to get my own estimation to compare. As you said, labor related cost includes wages, benefits and overhead. I will go to labor market and look at the average wages and benefits. I assume overhead cost doesn’t change much compared to USA. I will look at the rig manufactures in USA to get their labor cost break down to get the figure.\nInterviewer: The cost structure in USA is: (hourly rate)\n(1) wage: $25 per hour\n(2) benefit: $10 per hour\n(3) overhead $15 per hour\nThe cost in Venezuela is:\n(1) wage: $5 per hour\n(2) benefit: $2 per hour\n(3) overhead $13 per hour\nCandidate: This adds up only $20, $5 bucks less than what local suppliers bid.\nInterviewer: Why do you think it is less from bidding?\nCandidate: Bidders may consider training cost and get expat from USA to build up competence, etc. They may also accelerate equipment depreciation since we only ask them to bid on one rig. This will make overhead cost higher.\nWith this new labor cost, the cost savings manufactures can achieve will be:\n\n\n\nYear\nCost Savings\n\n\n0\n-$50M (initial investment)\n\n\n1\n$50*1M (USA) – $20*3M (Venezuela) = -$10M\n\n\n2\n$50*1M (USA) – $20*2M (Venezuela) = $10M\n\n\n3\n$50*1M (USA) – $20*1M (Venezuela) = $30M\n\n\n4\n$30M\n\n\n5\n$30M\n\n\n…\n$30M\n\n\n\nThey only need less than four years to pay back the initial investment.\nInterviewer: Good. We are running out of time. Why don’t you wrap up?\nCandidate: Our client PDVSA should pursue the opportunity of low cost labor in Venezuela. This will help them achieve cost savings and improve return on capital. Besides, this will also help them achieve a better government relationship, which further helps them in their oil and gas business.\nOur client PDVSA should help local suppliers to get into oil rig manufacture business. They can help them by signing a long term, e.g. 20 year contract with local suppliers. They should work together with local government to seeks funds for local suppliers, and to organize some cooperation activity with USA to build up local competence.\nOil rig is expensive and quality is important for this product. Local suppliers may be able to produce high quality rig. This is a risk factor to our client. Get good understanding of general manufacturing quality level in this country will allow our client to make proper judgment. If quality is a concern, our client will want to form joint venture with local suppliers so that they can have more control on rig quality. Doing so will also help them further save cost as well.\nInterviewer: Very good!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Consulting first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: industrial equipment, heavy equipment.\nCase Interview Question #00856: The client Cummins Power Systems LLC is a manufacturer of power generators for recreational vehicles. They are the dominant player with close to 90% market share. They attribute their market share to their high quality products. Of late, the smaller players, who have between them close to 10% of the market share, have improved their product quality over the years. This is posing a strong threat to the client Cummins. Our client has a strong brand and is a trusted name in the market.\nOur client Cummins Power Systems sells power generators only to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). OEM is a company that makes a part or subsystem that is used in another company’s end product. For example, if Acme Manufacturing Co. makes power cords that are used on IBM computers, Acme is the OEM.\nThere are two types of OEM suppliers: sole source and the dual source. The dual source implies that the customer makes the choice of the power generator. Of the markets they service, close to 95% of their sales comes from the North American region and the rest 5% from Europe.\nThe client Cummins Power Systems is worried about profitability in the coming years.

Quantity remains same.\n\nThe interviewer should ask the interviewee to draw up the revenues, costs and gross margins for each scenario. The entire table has to be made from the above information only.\nPossible Solution:\nI was first asked to describe a framework to analyze the case.

Monsanto is a leading producer of genetically engineered (GE) seed and glyphosate based herbicide.\nCorn farmers usually save a portion of the harvest to use as seed for planting it next year. However, in countries with high GDP like the USA, farmers typically purchase and plant hybrid corn seed, which is bred for specific characteristics, such as insect resistance. Another important characteristic is yield—how many bushels per acre can be grown from the seed.\nOur client Monsanto has developed a new hybrid corn with higher yield and would like to know how to price it. How would you help them pricing the new hybrid corn?\nAdditional Information: to be provided to candidate after relevant questions \n• This new hybrid corn increases the yield from 80 bushels per acre (industry average) to 90 bushels per acre.\n• Farmers sell corn at $10 per bushel.\n• 2 bags of corn seed are needed per acre, regardless of whether regular or hybrid corn seed is used.\n• Cost of corn seed to farmer is $80 per bag.\n• No additional costs (fertilizer, equipment, time, etc.) are incurred by farmers when switching from regular seed corn to hybrid corn.\n• There is no additional cost to the client Monsanto to switch to producing this new hybrid seed. The research and development costs have been taken care of in the R&D budget. (Note to Interviewer: You can make up these numbers when giving the case to make it more interesting).\nComplication:\nThe interviewer complicated matters by telling me that a weather event occurred 30 times in the last 150 years, which caused the crop to be completely wiped out. Determine how this would impact the pricing of hybrid corn.\nPossible Solution:\nI suggested determining the pricing strategy by looking at value to customer (corn farmers) and comparing that to our cost. I asked questions related to this approach (understanding the customer’s business model)\nValue to customer is:\nExtra 10 bushels/acre * $10/bushel = $100/acre\n• This is pure profit, because the corn farm still only has to buy two bags of seed corn per acre. The additional value to customer per bag is therefore $50 (because 2 bags are needed per acre).\n• Based on these data and the current cost per bag, we can charge up to $80 + $50 = $130/bag for the new hybrid corn seed.\nWhen I asked whether the value of this hybrid corn seed is apparent to the corn farmers, I was told that research result has been published in a peer-reviewed scientific magazine that farmers trust, so this shouldn’t be hard to sell.\nThe cost of producing the hybrid corn to the client Monsanto is the same, so we can charge up to $120 per bag (because we would want to leave some money on the table to induce purchase and gain additional market share).\nWe should probably launch this new product as soon as possible to lock in contracts with farmers before our competitors get to market with their version of this product.\nComplication:\nAll of the above discussion seemed pretty obvious. The interviewer further complicated matters by telling me that a rare weather event occurred 30 times in the last 150 years, which caused the crop to be completely wiped out. I was asked whether and how this would impact pricing.\nAs a result, the value to the farmer is reduced (the payoff is uncertain: 30/150 = 20%). The value to farmers becomes 80% * $50 = $40 per bag, so we can charge up to $80 + $40 = $120 per bag.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

How would you do it?\nFirst, tell me the major data and additional information you would need to make a thorough analysis and then whether or not you would recommend the merger.\nAdditional Information: to be provided to candidate after relevant questions\n• Capital investment required to make the merger = $200 M (shared in half by both banks)\n• RBC Bank current check processing unit cost = $0.40\n• Numbers of check processed by RBC Bank in a year = 200 M\n• PNC Bank current check processing unit cost = $0.45\n• Numbers of check processed by PNC Bank in a year = 200 M\n• Cost of capital = 10%\n• RBC Bank and PNC Bank estimate that the check processing cost per unit if the merger occurs = $0.36\nPossible Answer:\nFirst, I mentioned all relevant points necessary to analyze the case:\n• Financial: capital investment needed, cost of capital, expected benefits due the to merger;\n• Operational: how the checks are collected from the branches, how they are processed, synergies in terms of process and best practices, etc, so we could see whether there is any room for improvement.\nThen I said that we should do a net present value (NPV) analysis to verify the viability or not of the merger.\nIf you work the numbers, you will get the NPV for RBC Bank: -$20M and for PNC Bank: +$80M.\nRBC Bank:\n• Cost savings per year = ($0.40-$0.36) * 200M = $8M\n• PV of cost savings (assuming perpetuity) = $8M / 10% = $80M\n• NPV = $80M – $100M = -$20M\nPNC Bank:\n• Cost savings per year = ($0.45-$0.36) * 200M = $18M\n• PV of cost savings (assuming perpetuity) = $18M / 10% = $180M\n• NPV = $180M – $100M = $80M\nSo, the merger would be good for PNC Bank but not for RBC Bank.\nHowever, since the overall combined unit cost is reduced by the merger, it creates value and should be made if the NPV for RBC Bank were also positive. To do this we should reduce the capital investment for RBC Bank and increase the investment for PNC Bank.\nThe best case scenario would be splitting the added value by merging the two banks. That is, making both banks realize the same NPV through the merger.\n• Total cost savings = $80M + $180M = $260M\n• Value of the merger = $260M – $200M = $60M\n• To split the $60M, each bank should get $30M\n• RBC Bank’s share of the capital investment = $80M – $30M = $50M\n• PNC Bank’s share of the capital investment = $180M – $30M = $150M\nFor this best case scenario to happen, RBC Bank should invest $50M and PNC Bank $150M. This way both banks would end up having the same positive NPV of $30M and the merger will likely go through.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: increase sales; operations strategy, optimization; organizational behavior.\nConsulting Firm: ZS Associates first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: retail.\nCase Interview Question #00879: Our client Safeway, Inc. is a national grocery and supermarket chain headquartered in Pleasanton, California, United States. Safeway’s primary base of operations is in the western and central United States, with some stores located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the Eastern Seaboard. Based on 2009 revenue, Safeway is the 11th largest retailer in the United States.\nThe client Safeway has been steadily losing market share to its competitors. Safeway utilizes a high-low pricing strategy, in which regular prices are typically slightly higher than those of an everyday low price retailer such as Walmart. However, periodically high-low retailers drop prices significantly. During the time period in which a product’s price is decreased, the product is also promoted through print and in-store advertising. Our client Safeway expects a significant lift in sales during the periods in which a product is promoted. However, benchmarks against industry averages indicate that our client Safeway does not experience as large of a lift in sales as its competitors do during promotion. What would be your approach to increase sales lift when an item is promoted?\nAdditional Information:\n1. Everyday Low Pricing vs. High-Low Pricing\nShifting pricing strategy to an everyday low pricing model is not an option for the client Safeway. The client has made the decision to focus on being the industry leading high-low pricing grocer. They think they can compete with everyday low price retailers once this goal is achieved.\n2. Competition\nThere are 1-2 major high-low pricing competitors in each of the local regions in which the client Safeway operates. Our client’s everyday prices, timing of promotional cycle, and percent discounts are virtually identical to their competitor in each market.\n3. Promotion Planning at the Stores\nTiming: Store managers place orders with their distribution center for promoted products several weeks before the promotion takes place.\nPredicting Promotion Volume: Typically, store managers base the size of their promotional orders on the quantities ordered in the past on a similar promotion and more subjective factors like length of time since the item was last promoted and the store manager’s gut feel based on his years of experience. Most store managers have at least 10 years experience in the grocery industry.\nUnexpected Promotion Volume: If an employee notices the shelves are running low or out of stock on a promoted item, the store manager will place an order for additional product. Orders must be placed by mid-afternoon and are delivered the next morning. On occasion, the store will not know that they are out of stock on a particular item until a customer complains.\nDistribution Center Ordering Process: Buyers at the distribution center do not receive enough lead-time on incorporate store orders into the orders placed with suppliers for promotions. However, buyers have access to the quantity of product sold during similar promotions in the past. Buyers typically use this data when determining how much product to purchase for a given promotion.\nCustomer Experience: Safeway’s customers routinely complain that promoted products are not on the client store shelves during promotions. Customers are typically loyal to a particular grocery store, provided that it stocks the products they consume at a reasonable price.\nPossible Answer:\nI. Determine the Source of Disappointing Sales Lift\nA good candidate will peel back the onion to understand the source of the disappointing sales lift on promoted items one layer at a time:\n1. Our client’s promotions generate less volume than competitors’: Our client’s regular and promotional pricing is virtually identical to their competitors’ pricing. Therefore, we are generating less volume on any given promotion compared with our competitors.\n2. Promoted items not in-stock: The primary driver behind this lack of sales volume is the client’s inability to keep promoted items stocked on its shelves\na. We can’t sell it if we don’t have it on the shelf.\nb. Customers may not come back if they experience repeated shortages on promoted items.\n3. Ineffective promotion planning and execution causing missed sales opportunities: Store managers plan volumes for promotions based on gut feel and quantities ordered in the past for similar promotions – not based on quantities sold.\nII. Lay out Plan to Improve Process\nA strong candidate should recognize that we need to devise a way to utilize data on quantities sold during past similar promotions.\nA good answer will lay-out a strategy to include past sales on similar promotions in the planning process as detailed above. A great answer will also note that stores must have better visibility on the inventory of promoted items on their shelves.\nAccess to data that illustrates real-time movement of promoted items would give stores more lead-time in the event that items are selling faster than expected. A simpler non-technical solution, which could be implemented immediately, is to institute scheduled stock updates throughout the day, especially just before the daily store order deadline. This would help avoid products being out of stock for multiple days.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new business; pricing & valuation.\nConsulting Firm: IBM Global Business Services (GBS) 2nd round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: telecommunications, network.\nCase Interview Question #00880: Your client Shaw Communications Inc. (NYSE: SJR) is a Canadian cable television and telecommunications company. They are one of the leading providers of television and Internet access to Canadian consumers. Headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, Shaw provides services mostly in British Columbia and Alberta, with smaller systems in Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Northern Ontario.\nThe client Shaw Communications has been looking for ways to expand their business and has contracted IBM GBS to help them evaluate potential options. Specifically, the firm is contemplating an entry into the wireless telephone space, particularly as the Canadian government is preparing to auction valuable spectrum that could be used for a national wireless service. The client Shaw Communications would like your help in determining the maximum it should be willing to bid at the auction.\nPossible Answer: \nAfter the interviewer presents the case opening, the candidate should begin exploring how the client company Shaw Communications should value the spectrum. Beyond any initial clarifying questions, the candidate should establish that there will be three major components to the valuation.\n1. Upfront costs of building a wireless network in addition to the spectrum purchase.\n2. Annual variable costs that will occur annually over the life of the network.\n3. Revenues from selling wireless services to customers.\nAdditional Information:\nAs the candidate explores the opportunity, he or she may ask for more information to ascertain the different elements of the valuation. When asked, the interviewer may provide the following additional information:\n1. Spectrum Data\n• The spectrum would be perfect for any wireless voice/data service, and covers the entire country.\n• The client Shaw Communications currently does not have any spectrum assets.\n• The spectrum will be useful for five years (although it will take one year to build out the network) before new technologies render it obsolete.\n2. Market Data\n• Canada currently has 20 million wireless customers.\n• The client Shaw Communications estimates that with the spectrum and a built-out network, leveraging its brand, it can achieve 10% penetration upon launch of the service.\n• That 10% penetration will remain constant over the life of the network.\n3. Cost Data\n• The client company estimates it will cost $500 million dollars to build a network with capacity to service all the potential customers.\n• Once the network is operational, it will require significant maintenance as well as ancillary marketing/billing/other costs. These aggregate costs are estimated at $360 million annually.\n4. Revenue information\n• The average Canadian wireless user spends $40/month on their cell phone service.\nData and Calculations:\nAfter the initial prompt, the candidate may think of several elements that would need to be considered in valuing the spectrum. Although this may lead to many reasonable questions (i.e. how many other bidders are there? what other options does the client have for growth?), the interviewer should guide the candidate to consider the wireless opportunity as a stream of cash flows.\nInterviewer: What types of costs could the client Shaw Communications encounter in launching a wireless network?\nThe candidate may then ask questions regarding the estimated costs of building and operating the network. Ideally, the candidate will quickly sketch out a five year series of cash flows table.\nRevenue per year = 20M customers * 10% penetration * $40/month * 12 months/year = $960 million\n\n\n\n\nYear 1\nYear 2\nYear 3\nYear 4\nYear 5\n\n\nBuild Out Costs\n($500M)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating Costs\n\n($360)\n($360)\n($360)\n($360)\n\n\nRevenue\n\n$960M\n$960M\n$960M\n$960M\n\n\nTotal Profit (Cost)\n($500M)\n$600M\n$600M\n$600M\n$600M\n\n\n\nA good candidate would then look to discount the stream of cash flows to arrive at a net present value (NPV) that can be attributed to the spectrum. However, the interviewer could just instruct the candidate to ignore time value of money for the purposes of this exercise. Given that, the candidate should arrive at a valuation of ($600M * 4 – $500M = $1.9 billion) for the spectrum.\nRecommendations:\nInterviewer: The client Shaw Communications has asked us for our recommendation. What would you tell the client?\nCandidate: Given the assumptions laid out, I would recommend bidding no more than $1.9 billion on the available spectrum, given that the client firm can realistically achieve 10% market penetration and generate $40/month in revenue from the average customer.\nCandidate should realize that if the client company bids exactly $1.9 billion, it is not going to make any profits.\nOutstanding candidate should have asked upfront what the company’s expectation on return on investment (ROI) or the hurdle rate is. This will help determine the optimal amount to bid. Company ROI requirements can be based on historical figures or given by the management team for this specific project. For example, if the required ROI is 20%, then the maximum bid amount should be $1.9 billion/(1+20%) = $1.583 billion.\nAdditional Concerns:\nAt this point, ask the candidate if he/she has any additional concerns that have not been taken into account. These can include any number of issues, such as the following:\n• Are the client company’s assumptions accurate?\n• Does the client company have any other options beyond wireless?\n• Can the firm look to bundle its new wireless service with its existing service offerings to increase revenue or enhance customer stickiness?\n• Are there any regulatory concerns with regard to purchasing wireless spectrum?\n• What are potential competitive responses to entering the wireless space?\n• Are there strategies for entering the wireless market that don’t require purchasing wireless spectrum? i.e. partnering with wireless companies, become a virtual network operator, etc. In fact, in December 2015, Shaw announced its proposed acquisition of independent wireless provider Wind Mobile from its investors in a deal worth approximately $1.6 billion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: business competition, competitive response.\nConsulting Firm: Navigant Consulting first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: healthcare: pharmaceutical, biotech, life sciences.\nCase Interview Question #00881: Our client Salix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a specialist American pharmaceutical company headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina, United States. As of March 2015 it is the largest independent gastrointestinal specialty pharmaceutical company in the world. The company develops drugs that mainly treat various gastrointestinal disorders.\nAs the leading manufacturer of over-the-counter (OTC) stomach medicine, a $2.5 billion market, Salix Pharmaceuticals has traditionally enjoyed great success as a major brand in their market, holding steady at 15% of market share. However, they have recently faced competition from a private brand, which has gained 20% market share over the last few years and is continuously gaining 2 share points per year. Your consulting team has been brought in to assess the competitive landscape.\nFirst, calculate how much Salix would lost if they did nothing next year. Next, what do you recommend as next steps for Salix?\nPossible Answer:\nPart 1: If the client Salix Pharmaceuticals does nothing, how much will they lose in revenue (in dollars) to this private label next year?\nCalculations:\nSalix’s current dollar share in the market is $2.5 billion * 15% = $375 million.\nThe private brand will gain a total of $2.5 billion * 2% = $50 million of new business next year.\nThe private brand’s gain will come from the 80% of the market share that it doesn’t own currently. Salix’s share in this “new to private brand sector” is 15% / 80% = 18.75%. So, Salix’s corresponding loss next year will be $50 million * 18.75% = $9.4 million, if Salix does nothing.\nPart 2: What do you recommend as next steps for Salix Pharmaceuticals?\nPossible Answer:\nNote to Interviewer: Let the candidate drive the case. The candidate should, at this time, draw out a framework.\nSuggested Framework:\nThe candidate should draw out a 3Cs framework considering factors similar to those outlined below:\n\n\n\nPrivate Label\nSalix\n\n\nProduct Mix Considerations:\n\nDifferences in product offerings;\nProfitability of offerings;\nShare gains of specific products over the past few years\n\n\nCustomers:\n\nWhat are our product lines?\nWho specifically are we losing?\nHave customers’ preferences/tastes changed?\n\n\n\n\nPricing and Cost Structure:\n\nWhat are their margins compared to ours?\n\n\nCompany:\n\nWhere are we lagging behind?\nWhat’s our cost structure?\nConsider marketing effectiveness\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is additional information that can be provided to the candidate if asked.\nAdditional Information:\n• Salix currently specializes in two main product lines. One is a simple, upset stomach remedy, while the other is a multiple symptom product.\n• Each product line comprises 50% of Salix’s production.\n• Currently there are no private labels competitors for the multi-symptom product, only for the simple, upset stomach product.\nA good candidate will probe more on the profitability of the simple product line versus the multi-symptom product where we don’t face a threat from private brands.\nInterviewer: If asked about the pricing differences, tell the candidate that the multi-symptom product is priced higher than the one-symptom product.\nIf probed about the cost structure differences, ask the candidate what he/she thinks the differences might be.\nOther than marketing expense, which you can say are currently equal for both brands, a good candidate should conclude that given the nature of the drugs industry, the marginal costs of production are very low and essentially the same for both product lines. Thus, given the higher prices of the multi-symptom product, Salix earns higher margins on that product line, and given the lack of private brand competition, Salix should focus efforts on the multi-symptom product line.\nRecommendations:\nInterviewer: What would be your suggestions to Salix for expansion of the multi-symptom line?\nA possible response:\nConsider expansion into regional areas that Salix does not currently have a presence in. Also, Salix can look to expand multi-symptom product line into a similar product for children, if one doesn’t currently exist. Salix can also look to increase marketing efforts through additional advertising of multi-symptom product and extend deeper into specific channels such as doctors and hospitals.\nAdditional Considerations:\nInterviewer: What are some of the potential risks?\nSome possibilities include:\n• Private brand introduces a multi-symptom product line.\n• Threats from other brand name competitors.\n• New breakthroughs in upset stomach medications after investments in marketing and expansion have already been made.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

It has a reasonable sales turnover. Revenue in fiscal year 2014 is $25.764 billion CAD. We have been hired to devise ways to further increase the sales. What would you recommend?\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate: First of all, can you tell me a bit more about the client company? \nInterviewer: 7% market share in the global market, good enough in industry. We don’t look at specific insurance products, we’re looking from sales side.\nCandidate: How does sales mechanism work?\nInterviewer: We don’t have sales force on roles, we have sales officer (on company roles), sales people are not on rolls (like a contractor).\nCandidate: I’d like to divide the problem into 5 heads: recruitment, training, incentives, retention and competition. Under each head:\nRecruitment:\nCandidate: How are Sales Officers recruited? And how are sales people recruited? What do you look for in sales people? Who is in charge of recruits?\nInterviewer: The client company recruits all the Sales Officers. Sales people are recruited by sales officers. There are no specific policy, it’s completely decided by sales officer.\nCandidate: Are these geographically spread? Are they doing equally well across all geographies? Are there a minimum number of sales people each sales officer has to maintain?\nInterviewer: No, nothing like that.\nCandidate: Does it affect your sales? I mean does different geography have different performance?\nInterviewer: That could be something we could look at, but it’s not relevant in this case.\nTraining:\nCandidate: What kind of training is given?\nInterviewer: We tell them what are the insurance products that are offered.\nCandidate: Are there any soft skills taught?\nInterviewer: Nothing as of now, is that something you think we should look at?\nCandidate: Do we have refresher kind of courses?\nInterviewer: When a new insurance product is launched, the sales officer gets a memo, which is given to sales people.\nCandidate: Do you do any kind of best practice sharing, it could work as an incentive scheme.\nInterviewer: No, nothing as of now.\nIncentive:\nCandidate: What are the hard and soft incentives provided?\nInterviewer: There was no incentive for sales officer. A sales target is given, which is split among the sales people.\nCandidate: I see. What will you consider in setting the targets?\nInteviewer: What do you think?\nCandidate: I’d look at Geographies – metropolitan areas should have more sales than rural. I’d also look at industry penetration there. If the market is not penetrated, I suppose we could sell more. What are the incentives for sales people?\nInterviewer: They have no fixed compensation, they get a commission of 10% of the insurance premium sold, which is par for the course in the industry.\nCandidate: Are there any soft incentives?\nInterviewer: No, there aren’t.\nCandidate: Perhaps we could set up such an incentive system. For example, when the Super Bowl comes, the best three sales people get to go.\nRetention:\nCandidate: How are the retention rates of the client company?\nInterviewer: The sales officers tend to stay long, but there is a large churn amongst sales people.\nCandidate: Does the company have a retention policy?\nInterviewer: Could you elaborate?\nCandidate: For example, there is a scheme by Vodafone where they giva the person a bike if they stay for 3 years. Does the firm lose employees to competitors?\nInterviewer: To some extent yes, but we don’t think that is significant.\nCandidate: Because there is so much churn, does new sales person training cost a lot?\nInterviewer: We have no information on that. What could be more important?\nCandidate: We could focus on reducing the time lag before the replacement hire is productive.\nInterviewer: So, what do you suggest?\nCandidate: If we know churn rate, we could do continuous recruiting, but this will not work because sales officers recruit the sales people independently.\nInterviewer: I think we’re running out of time here. Why don’t you wrap it up now?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The company was formed in 1948 by a merger of two Scottish family businesses: McVitie & Price and MacFarlane Lang. The company’s headquarters is in Hayes in suburban West London.\nAs a major biscuit manufacturer, the client produces biscuits under a number of brand names including: McVitie’s biscuits and Jacob’s Cream Crackers. Recently, they have hired your consulting firm because the CEO of United Biscuits felt that it was not cost effective. You have been assigned the task of helping the client figure out where they can cut costs. What would you do?\nPossible Answer:\nInterviewer: First of all, what do you think are the various cost elements of a biscuit manufacturing company?\nCandidate: The various cost elements in the firm will be manufacturing, supply chain and distribution costs and other administrative costs. Manufacturing can be again divided into procurement cost, raw materials cost, labor wages.\nInterviewer: OK, let’s start with the supply chain.\nCandidate: I need some background information regarding the company such as how many manufacturing plants it has?\nInterviewer: The client company has 15 third party manufacturing plants and 3 plants of its own. The supply chain is common for all.\nCandidate: I will split the supply chain again into inward and outward logistics. There will be various raw materials such as corn, flour, oil, sugar and butter for the manufacturing of biscuits. Can I get the cost of each of these components?\nInterviewer: They’re not relevant. Focus on outbound supply chain.\nCandidate: What is the structure of the distribution channel?\nInterviewer: Basically, there is inventory from factory to warehouse and then to distributors.\nCandidate: I will look at transportation costs and inventory costs in these cases. Can I have the split up of costs for transportation like the transportation cost per unit?\nInterviewer: Transportation cost is €0.25 per mile per thousand pounds of biscuit and the distance between factories to the warehouse to 300 miles.\nCandidate: Does the transportation company charge the same amount for all similar transports across the industry?\nInterviewer: The unit cost of transportation for all the competitors is the same.\nCandidate: What is the distance from the factory to warehouse for the competitors?\nInterviewer: We do not have that information, but in general the average distance traveled by trucks for transportation in the industry is 200 miles.\nCandidate: In that case our client company’s trucks are traveling a greater distance compared to our competitors. Can I get the location of the factories and warehouses?\nInterviewer: The factories are located in remote rural locations. This was actually the reason for high costs for the client. The client was spending heavily on transportation. I think that concludes our discussion in the case. Do you have any questions for me?\nCandidate: Not at this point.

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new product; pricing & valuation.\nConsulting Firm: IMS Health Consulting Group first round job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: Healthcare: Pharmaceutical, Biotech, Life Sciences.\nCase Interview Question #00874: Our client Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) is a global pharmaceutical corporation headquartered in New York City, with its research headquarters in Groton, Connecticut. Pfizer is among the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies, with revenues of USD $48.85 billion in fiscal year 2015.\nTwo years ago, researchers at Pfizer invented a drug – tentatively branded Effexor – to treat acute depression. Unlike most antidepressants, the drug is preventative rather than responsive. Whereas most antidepressants attempt to treat diagnosed cases of depression, Effexor is designed for consumption even before symptoms emerge. It is aimed at individuals who are deemed “high risk” for acute depression due to family history, an acute trauma, or a variety of other factors. The drug is available by prescription only and it has no known side effects. Effexor just received regulatory approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Pfizer is considering how to price the drug in the U.S. You have been asked to size the market and recommend a price. How would you go about it?\nAdditional Information: to be provided to candidate after relevant questions \nProvide the following information only if explicitly asked. If the candidate asks for other information, state that “we may get to that later.”\n1. This new drug Effexor has not yet been covered by insurance.\n2. Medical bills for acute depression average $10,000 annually per case (i.e. per patient). This includes costs associated with drugs, therapy, and hospitalization.\n3. Research and development (R&D) costs of Effexor were $500M.\n4. The drug is a single tablet taken on a daily basis.\nPossible Answer:\nThe candidate should develop a framework to assess the problem. This case has components of market sizing, new product launch, and pricing. As such, the framework should at least include: Market (size, competitor drugs, market share), Product (strengths, weaknesses, etc.) and a Pricing model (either cost-based pricing or value based).\nPhase 1: Insurance Coverage\nInterviewer: What factors do you think are most critical to the price of the new drug? This is meant to serve as a brainstorming moment to assess candidate’s intuition and creativity.\nCandidate: Answers could include uniqueness (a lack of substitutes), the extent to which the public and doctors accept a radically new way of understanding mental illness prevention, etc. Ultimately however, the key issue will be whether insurers cover the drug. If insurers do not cover Effexor, it will not gain traction in the market. Allow the candidate to brainstorm until he or she runs out of gas. If the insurance issue is not mentioned, guide the Candidate with questions like: “what constituencies are critical to establishing the price of drugs?”\nInterviewer: How would the insurance company decide whether to cover the drug or not?\nCandidate: Although other considerations are nominally relevant, this is really a question about costs: is the current treatment model cheaper than a treatment model that includes the prospective new drug?\nInterviewer: One price that has been floated is $50.  How would you assess whether or not an insurer would cover the drug at this price if the company covered the entire cost? Allow minimal rounding.\nPossible Answer:\nThe Candidate should see that he or she must compare the costs associated with current treatment model and the costs associated with the new drug treatment model. If the Candidate doesn’t begin to perform this comparison, provide clues. Make sure that the Candidate uses the following assumptions:\n• 300 million people in the United States.\n• 1 in 200 Americans suffer from acute depression.\n• 1 in 100 Americans are considered at risk and of that group, only 1 in 5 are considered high risk for acute depression. Assume that all individuals considered high risk would develop acute depression.\n• The new drug Effexor is a tablet taken on a daily basis. The drug price covers ten tablets.\n• Annual treatment for acute depression costs $10,000 per case.\n• Effexor is 70% effective. That is, of people considered high risk taking Effexor, 70% will not develop acute depression and 30% will. For simplicity, assume that the 30% who develop acute depression will also cost insurers $10,000 each, in addition to the cost of the Effexor.\n• For simplicity, assume that all individuals who suffer acute depression receive treatment.\na. Current costs to insurers:\n300M people in America * 1/200 Americans suffer from acute depression = 1.5M cases\n1.5M cases * $10,000 per case = $15B\nb. New drug costs:\nNew drug costs = (1) cost of identified individuals treated by Effexor + (2) additional cost of identified individuals unsuccessfully treated by Effexor + (3) cost of unidentified individuals treated conventionally.\n(1) cost of identified individuals treated by Effexor\n300M people in America * 1/100 considered at risk * 1/5 considered high risk = 600,000 high risk individuals\n600,000 high risk individuals * $50 per package / 10 pills per package * 365 days = ~$1B\n(2) additional cost of identified individuals unsuccessfully treated by Effexor\nAdditional costs associated with individuals for whom the drug is not effective:\n600,000 high risk individuals * 30% failure rate *  $10,000 per case = $1.8B\n(3) cost of unidentified individuals treated conventionally\nDon’t forget that there are 900,000 individuals (1.5M cases – 600,000 identified cases) who are not identified as high risk. This (900,000 * $10,000 = $9B) must be added to the annual cost of the new drug treatment model.\nBecause the current costs of $15B exceed the ~$12B in costs associated with the new drug scenario (～1B+1.8B+9B), insurers would likely cover the new drug.\nPhase 2: Follow-up\nInterviewer: What would you charge for the new drug? No calculations are necessary, but do you think you could get more for the drug?\nCandidate: There is no correct answer here. One might answer that insurers would accepte a price that brings new drug costs up to the current costs. Alternatively, the question of adoption may necessitate a lower price. Again, this is more of a check on intuition, creativity and logic.\nInterviewer: What single factor would allow Pfizer to raise prices?\nCandidate: Improved screening.  Although 1/200 individuals develop acute depression only 1/500 are identified.\nPhase 3: Production Economics\nInterviewer: Our client liaison from Pfizer is a bumbling guy who learned all his economics from Wikipedia. He thinks the $500M research and development costs for the drug must be covered by future revenue streams, or else we shouldn’t proceed with large-scale production.\nCandidate: That is not the correct thinking. The $500M of R&D is sunk. What matters is that revenues cover variable costs of production.\nInterviewer: Excellent. So the variable costs of production work out to be $10 per package of 10 pills. Fixed costs are zero. What’s the margin? What’s the markup?\nCandidate:\nMargin = $(50-10) / $50 = 80%\nMarkup = $(50-10) / $10 = 400%\nInterviewer: Pretty sharp. So indulge the client anyway. They recognize that the R&D costs are sunk, but still want to know the breakeven period for this new drug. Assume a negligibje discount rate.\nCandidate:\nAnnual profits = 600,000 high risk individuals * ($50-$10) per package / 10 pills perpackage * 365 days = ~$800M\nBreak-even period = ($500M / $800M) years = ～between 7-8 months\nPhase 4: Recommendation\nThe Candidate should deliver a formal recommendation that restates the market size, recommends a sensible price, and synthesizes any other witty insights that arise along the way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

(NASDAQ: ATVI) is a large media and video games publishing company based in Los Angeles, California, United States. Formed in 2008 by the merger of Activision and Blizzard Entertainment, the company is the fifth largest gaming company by revenue as of 2014. Intellectual property published by Activision Blizzard include the multi-million dollar video game franchises of Call of Duty, StarCraft, and Warcraft.\nThe client Activision Blizzard currently has two offices. One in Santa Monica and one in Century City. Recently, they have made the decision to combine operations into one building and will choose one of their existing buildings, but are unsure which one to choose. What should they do?\nThe candidate should look at two main things:\n(1) The economics of the move\n(2) The softer issues about integration\nPossible Answer:\nPart 1 – The Economics\nThe candidate should identify rent, capacity requirements, switching costs associated with the move, the cost to upgrade the existing structure to make it usable by the increased number of employees, etc. The candidate should also ask if the client leases or owns the two office locations and what each office is used for (i.e. what divisions of the operation are housed in each).\nOnce they ask for these things, the interviewer can provide the following additional information.\nAdditional Information:\n• The client requires 100K square feet of space.\n• The client leases the two offices for 10 years.\n• The client will sub-lease (rent) any space it doesn’t use.\n\n\n\nOffice\nSanta Monica\nCentury City\n\n\nPurpose\nVideo Games\nDVD’s\n\n\nSpace (in sq ft)\n200,000\n400,000\n\n\nCost per sq ft per year\n$40\n$40\n\n\nBuild-out cost (over 10 years)\n$1.5M\n$500K\n\n\nAverage vacancy rate of city\n10%\n18%\n\n\n\nKey Assumptions:\n• Assume they can sub-lease any and all unused space.\n• The remaining time on the current leases is 10 years.\nInterviewer: Ask the candidate what they think about the vacancy rate as it pertains to the rent they can charge for the sub-lease.\nCandidate: Answer should be that the higher the vacancy rate, the more supply, and therefore the lower the price they will be able to charge for sublease.\nInterviewer: Given that, allow them to assume that the sublease price they can charge per sq ft is $40 for Santa Monica and $30 for Century City.\nIf the candidate does not begin to do so on their own, ask them to calculate the financial impact of each option (may be in total or per year):\nNote: The candidate should realize that the client is already locked into a 10 year lease with both buildings.\nAnnual Financial Impact of each alternative:\n\n\n\n\nOccupy Santa Monica only\nOccupy Century City only\n\n\nSanta Monica Rent\n($8,000,000)\n($8,000,000)\n\n\nCentury City Rent\n($16,000,000)\n($16,000,000)\n\n\nBuild-out Cost (per year)\n($150,000)\n($50,000)\n\n\nTotal Cost / year\n($24,150,000)\n($24,050,000)\n\n\nSub-lease Income – Santa Monica\n$4,000,000\n$8,000,000\n\n\nSub-lease Income – Century City\n$12,000,000\n$9,000,000\n\n\nTotal Sub-lease Income\n$16,000,000\n$17,000,000\n\n\nNet Impact\n($8,150,000)\n($7,050,000)\n\n\n\nSanta Monica Rent = 200K sq ft * $40\nCentury City Rent = 400K sq ft * $40\nBuild-out Cost per year = Total build-out cost / 10 years\nSub-lease Income of client occupied building = (Total sq ft – 100K sq ft) * sublease rate\nSub-lease Income of 100% subleased building = Total sq ft * sublease rate\nThe candidate should quickly see that moving to Century City is optimal.\nNote: A good candidate will note that so far, we’ve only looked at the financial aspects of the situation. This is NOT enough information on which to base a decision.\nPart 2: The integration issues\nInterviewer: Besides the economics, what else should they consider?\nCandidate: Answers should include the following. (Allow the candidate to think about this and come up with a short list of possibilities, explaining each)\n• Workforce integration issues\n• Proximity to clients/customers\n• Proximity to employee homes\nInterviewer: Ask the candidate to recommend how he/she would inform the employees of the move, and the pros and cons for each approach.\nNote: There is not necessarily a perfect answer but a good candidate will identify several alternatives (which could include a few possibilities from the following list). It is important that they identify the pros and cons of each alternative and clearly communicate the ramifications of each option (business strategy, talent retention, office politics, etc.)\n• Office wide-meeting\n• Starting with top employees to ensure they are retained\n• E-mail or memo\n• One on one discussions between managers or employees\nInterviewer: Ask the candidate to make a formal recommendation. It should be direct while providing potential risks. Extremely good answers will have next steps such as identifying where employees live using HR to look up the zip codes, drafting up a survey to ask employees where they want to work, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: increase sales.\nConsulting Firm: McKinsey & Company first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: automotive, motor vehicles; sports, leisure & recreation.\nCase Interview Question #00876: Our client is the President and CEO of Zippy Snowmobiles Inc, a snowmobile manufacturer based in the United States. The company makes snowmobiles for recreational users only. A snowmobile, also known as a sled or a snowmachine, is a vehicle designed for winter travel and recreation on snow. It is designed to be operated on snow and ice and does not require a road or trail but most are driven on open terrain or trails.\nThe year is 2009. Zippy Snowmobiles has faced falling sales over the past 7 years (from 2001 to 2008), of 7% per year, or about 40% over that 7-year period. Zippy’s President has hired McKinsey & Company to investigate and reverse this trend of falling sales. As part of a McKinsey team, what would you do about this case?\nPossible Solution:\nQuestion #1: What areas would you like to explore?\nPossible Answer:\nThe candidate may outline the following high-level issues:\n• Market: Extent of market, Size/Growth overall, Competition, Criteria for Success.\n• Revenue: Pricing, Volumes, Product Mix & Seasonal Balance.\n• Costs: While addressing revenue issues, make sure solutions do not overextend costs (e.g. diseconomies of scale if there is rapid growth) and hurt profitability.\n• Risks: Stress-test any sales improvement proposal by considering potential risks/barriers.\nQuestion #2: Examine the Market. The interviewer should show the candidate Exhibit 1 and ask for an assessment.\nExhibit 1. Snowmobiles revenues (USD $) from 2001-2008 in North America\n\nPossible Answer:\nSuggested answers include:\n• Overall market size has shrunk about 40% over the 7-year period. Zippy’s problem reflects industry-wide problem.\n• One player Northpoint has disappeared between year 2005 and 2006. It could have been acquired by Gemco, which had a revenue spurt after Northpoint was gone. It might be a good idea to study Northpoint’s demise for cautionary lessons.\n• Sierra’s market share has actually increased in a declining market. This firm’s strategies may offer clues as well on best practices.\nQuestion #3: Can you consider some revenue growth strategies for Zippy?\nPossible Answer:\nSuggested answers by Candidate:\n• M&A with other players\n• Organic growth strategies (in accordance with Ansoff Matrix)\n• Maximize revenues per sales, e.g. use bundling, tying, loss-leader strategies\n• Extend product line in current market (create seasonal balance; produce complementary products that can sell well in summer months when snowmobiles do poorly)\n• Extend same product line to new markets (overseas, more regions, etc)\n• Potential segmentation strategy: Seek out customer segments that have specialized needs (children? Physically challenged?) and try to reach them (carve out blue-ocean) before other competitors.\nQuestion #4: The President of Zippy wants to know what increase in market share is needed in year 2009 compared to 2008, in order to maintain the same revenue dollars as in 2002. Note: Only when asked, indicate that the overall market is expected to decline 8% from 2008 to 2009.\nPossible Answer:\nCalculations:\nTotal market size in 2002 = $190M\nZippy’s Revenue in 2002 = $75M\nZippy 2002 market share = $75M/$190M = ~40% (approx.)\nTotal market size in 2008 = $120M\nZippy’s Revenue in 2008 = $48M\nZippy 2008 market share = $48M/$120M = 40%\nTotal market size in 2009 = (1-8%) * $120M = $11OM (rounded is fine)\nMarket share required in 2009 = $75M / $110M = ~70% (approx.)\nIncrease in 2009 market share vs. 2008 = 70% – 40% = 30% (or increase about 75% when taking a percentage of the percentage increase)\nQuestion #5: The Chief Marketing Officer of Zippy has come up with ideas to increase sales. He would like our team to assess the incremental profits generated by his promotion plan. (See Exhibit 2)\nExhibit 2. Number of Zippy Snowmobiles sold in one year (status quo vs. with gas card promotion)\n\nAdditional Information:\nInterviewer should provide the following facts:\n• Snowmobile buyers will get a $200 gas card with every Zippy snowmobile purchase.\n• This gas card entitles them to pump $200 worth of gas.\n• The expected gas card redemption rate is 30%.\n• Zippy bears full costs of redeemed gas dollars.\nInterviewer can provide these extra facts only when prompted:\n• Retail price of each Zippy snowmobile = $50,000\n• Variable cost of producing each snowmobile = $20,000\nPossible Answer:\nCalculations:\nIncremental profits from gas card promotion = Additional customers x (Price – Variable Cost) – Cost of Gas Cards\n= 100 x ($50,000 – $20,000) – (30% x $200 x 1,100 cards)\n= $3,000,000 – $66,000\n= $2,944,000 or $2.94M\nQuestion #6: Making a recommendation: What will you tell the President of Zippy’s?\nPossible Answer:\nRecap objective: “We were asked to investigate and reverse the trend of Zippy’s falling revenues.”\nElaboration: “Under organic growth measures, Zippy can extend its product line to improve seasonal balance, or extend to new markets. The gas card promotion is one means of boosting revenue growth and plough in profits that can finance future growth.\nUnder strategic M&A moves, we will need to conduct due diligence and valuation on possible candidates, such Sierra which appears to be a strong company albeit smaller than Zippy’s. The McKinsey team would be happy to study such options further.”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: increase sales/revenue; private equity & investment.\nConsulting Firm: Bain & Company first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: sports, leisure & recreation.\nCase Interview Question #00877: Our client Fenway Partners is an American private equity firm that makes leveraged buyout and growth capital investments in transportation, logistics, consumer products and manufacturing companies in the middle market. The firm was founded in 1994 and has over $2 billion of  capital under management.\nThe client Fenway Partners is interested in Pacific Cycle Inc., a bicycle component manufacturer. The company makes gears, brakes, suspensions – anything that goes into building a bicycle. The management of Pacific Cycle claims that they will experience 10% revenue growth a year for the next five years. Our client Fenway Partners wants to know if this growth rate is possible. Your consulting team has been tasked with conducting due diligence and developing strategies to increase revenues. What would you do?\nPossible Answer:\nPart I: Industry growth rate \nAfter making a structure that probably includes industry/market, company, and strategies for revenue growth, the candidate should ask questions to get the following additional information from the interviewer.\nAdditional Information:\n• The target company Pacific Cycle has 20% market share; the leading competitor has 80% share.\n• There are three types of bicycles in the bicycle market: mountain bikes, road/racing bikes (what Lance Armstrong rides), and pavement/city bikes (cheap).\n• The breakdown of the bicycle market (in volume) by type is mountain bikes 30%, road/racing bikes 20%, and pavement/city bikes 50%, respectively.\n• The target company Pacific Cycle’s breakdown (in volume) by the bicycle types their parts go into is 60%, 30%, and 10%, respectively.\n• The markets for each bicycle type is expected to decrease by 1%, decrease by 3%, and increase by 5%, respectively.\nThe candidate should realize that the next step is to calculate the growth rate of the overall bicycle market.\n• Mountain Bikes = -1% * 30% = -0.3%\n• Road Bikes = -3% * 20% = -0.6%\n• Pavement Bikes = 5% * 50% = 2.5%\nOverall growth rate of bicycle industry = (-0.3%) + (-0.6%) + 2.5% = +1.6%\nKey insight: growth rate of the industry (1.6%) is much lower than the target company’s projected 1O% annual revenue growth rate.\nIf the candidate doesn’t do so themselves, prompt them to figure out how this growth rate compares with the company’s expected growth rate based on growth expectations for each bicycle type. If the candidate asks if the company has any intent on changing the product/client mix to sell parts to pavement bike companies since that is the market that is growing, tell them that the company does not want to switch its mix because pavement bikes are cheap and have lower margins.\n• Mountain Bikes = -1% * 60% = -0.6%\n• Road Bikes  = -3% * 30% = -0.9%\n• Pavement Bikes = 5% * 10%  = 0.5%\nOverall growth rate for target company = (-0.6%) + (-0.9%) + 0.5% = -1.0%\nKey insight: the growth rate of volume demand for the target company’s parts is expected to be negative!\nNote: At this point the candidate should realize that this growth rate applies to sales volume only. There may be other reasons at play that may still make the management’s 10% revenue growth forecast feasible.\nPart II: Strategies to increase revenues\nThe second part of the case focuses on determining whether the target company’s projected revenue growth rate is possible – and specifically, how they could achieve it.\nInterviewer: What could be some ways of bringing the revenue growth rate closer to the projected 1O%?\nThe candidate should be structured and brainstorm ideas including:\n• Increasing the overall demand for parts (replacement versus accessories)\n• Capturing market share from the competitors\n• R&D to improve quality of parts\n• Lower price\n• Increase product mix to sell parts they weren’t selling before\n• Increase price of current products\n• Enter into adjacent markets (New applications for parts)\nInterviewer: Let’s say we know that the target company’s access to the bicycle market is currently 60%; 40% of the market just doesn’t buy from our company. Management thinks that they can increase access to 70% in 5 years.\nCandidate: The candidate should then ask about the total size of the market.\nInterviewer: 100 million units are sold a year.\nThe candidate should then calculate:\nCandidate: Currently, the company has a 20% market share. So that means that they currently sell 20 million units. Given they have access to 60% of the market (60 million units), we can conclude that they sell one out of the three units they can potentially sell. If they increase their access to 70%, they will have access to 70 million units; this implies that the increase of additional potential units sold would be 10 million multiplied by 1/3 = 3.3 million.\nKey insight: increasing access to the market will result in an increase of about 16%-17% (units sold). However, the projected increase to 70% market access is expected to occur over five years, so its average annual growth over five years will most likely be something like 3%-4% per year (1.03^5 = 1.16).\nInterviewer: What else can they do given their current market share?\nCandidate: They can try to increase sales within the customers they do have access to. They only reach 1/3 of potential sales so far, they can potentially triple their current revenues. They can work on understanding why they are losing 2/3 of potential sales, what the competitors are doing, and whether they can increase marketing or improve products to sell more to their current customers.\nInterviewer: They think that they can increase the 33% sale/access ratio to 50% over 5 years.\nCandidate: Combined with the 70% market access, 50% of 70 million units is 35 million units. This represents a 75% increase over the 20 million units they are currently selling. Since they will increase their sale/access ratio over five years, the annual growth rate will be well over 10% (1.1^5 = 1.61).\nInterviewer: So, what is your final recommendation?\nCandidate: The candidate should recognize that if the target company management’s assumptions on customer access and market share are correct, they should be able to out perform their projection of 10% annual growth. This could be an opportunity for our client to purchase the target company at a discount!\nAs a follow-up, the candidate could recommend to confirm pricing trends, adjacency opportunities, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: increase sales/revenues.\nConsulting Firm: IMS Health Consulting Group first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: healthcare: pharmaceutical, biotech, life sciences.\nCase Interview Question #00878: Our client Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) is a global pharmaceutical corporation headquartered in New York City, New York, with its research headquarters in Groton, Connecticut. It is among the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies. Pfizer’s best-selling product is the blockbuster drug Atorvastatin (trade name Lipitor), used to lower LDL blood cholesterol.\nLipitor was developed by Pfizer legacy company Warner-Lambert and first marketed in 1996. From 1996 to 2012 under the trade name Lipitor, Atorvastatin became the world’s best-selling drug of all time, with more than $125 billion in sales over approximately 14.5 years. Lipitor alone provided up to a quarter of Pfizer’s annual revenue for years.\nThe year is 2011. The patent of Pfizer’s blockbuster drug Lipitor will run out in less than a year. Lipitor generates a quarter of the company’s revenues. They have 10 other drugs that generate the other 75% of the revenues. Research and development (R&D) is more than 5 years away from the next blockbuster. Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are out of the question. How can we help the client Pfizer?\nAdditional Information: \n1. Cost\nThe client company Pfizer is efficient and well run. In fact it has been cutting costs for the last several years. In general, costs are competitive with industry standards.\n2. Company\nHere the main area to talk about is the marketing/sales department.\nThe client company Pfizer has a dedicated sales force of about 150 people. On an average a sales person is responsible for 100 doctors. The industry standard is one sales person for every 50 doctors. In fact the sales department is seriously under staffed.\nA major portion of a sales person’s compensation is dependent on the contribution margin of the drugs they sell. Each sales person has a portfolio of drugs with varying degrees of contribution margins. The contribution margin for Lipitor is the lowest. So far this strategy has worked as there was more pull for the drug than push required from the sales people. \n3. Customer\nThe sales representative focus mainly on selling to doctors. (Note: 20% of all doctors make 80% of prescriptions). They also keep in touch with major HMOs (health maintenance organizations), PPOs (preferred provider organizations), etc to get their drug in the preferred list of HMOs and PPOs.\n4. Competition\nThere is presently no single drug that has a similar chemical composition as Lipitor but doctors have been trying out a combination of drug regimen from a rival company. The rival company has the advantage of a bigger sales force which can reach out to 35% of all doctors in the U.S. as compared to our client’s reach which is about 10%.\nWhen the Lipitor patent expires our client Pfizer will get about 6 months before generic drug companies come up in the market.\nPossible Answer:\nThis is a cost/revenue case with life cycle product management thrown in. The candidate should quickly dismiss cost reduction initiatives, as they will not save the client company since it is a well-established company and has been cutting costs for several years. The solution lies on the revenue side. Some of the key things the candidate should be able to point out are listed below.\n1. In the present year just before the patent expires and till 6 months later the client company Pfizer should try to increase revenues:\n• This can be done by increasing the size of their sales force and send them out after more doctors. One can draw a graph to represent the firm’s productivity when adding additional sales people. At what point do you quit adding sales personnel: marginal revenue (MR) generated exceed marginal cost (MC).\n• Other ways to bolster sales: give current sales people greater contribution margins to sell more, give them more samples for doctors and increase emphasis on advertising.\n2. After the patent has expired, some of the marketing programs could be:\n• Trying to patent a specific dosage size\n• Doing more direct-to-consumer marketing\n• Looking at overseas markets \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The company operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of Japanese multinational corporation Toyota Motor. Toyota was the largest automobile manufacturer in 2012 (by production) ahead of the Volkswagen Group and General Motors.\nRecently, Toyota Motor North America is considering entering into the pick-up truck market in the U.S. A pickup truck is a light duty truck having an enclosed cab and an open cargo area with low sides and tailgate. Pickup trucks have been very popular in North America. Currently, 750,000 pick-up trucks are sold in this market every year.\nAn initial investment of $1 billion dollars is required to build a plant, should they enter?\nAdditional Information: to be provided to candidate after relevant questions\nMarket and Company data \n\nCurrent Market Price = $30,000\nPlant Capacity = 200K/year\nPlant life time = 10 years\nElasticity of Demand = 3\nVariable Cost = $20,000\nOur cost of capital = 10%\n\nPossible Solution:\nThis is a basic market entry case. The decision whether to enter a new market is purely based on the calculated profitability. Note that new entrants reduce the price in the market and the candidate must make a careful assessment of whether the new entrant can be profitable given the demand elasticity.\nFirst, we need to estimate the impact of the entry on the market retail price:\n• The percentage change in sales volume Q: %∆Q = 200K/750K = ~30% (approximately)\n• Using Elasticity of Demand = %∆Q/%∆P = 3;\n• Percentage change in market price: %∆P= 30%/3 = 10%\nTherefore, the new retail price will be $30,000 less 10% which is $27,000\nDemand Curve for pick up trucks in this market\n\nSecond, look into whether the client Toyota Motor North America can make money at this retail price.\n• Variable cost = $20K\n• Therefore contribution margin = $27K – $20K = $7K; we can sell 200K pickup trucks per year, so contribution per year is $7K * 200,000 = $1.4 billion dollars.\n• The plant has a expected life of ten years, so a total of $14 billion dollars will be made.\n• Our cost of capital is 10%, therefore there is a capital charge of $100 M dollars per year for a total of $1 billion dollars.\n• The $1 billion initial investment must be returned at the end.\n• Thus, total profit is $14 – $1 – $1 = $12 billion dollars.\nThe interviewer then asked about the Cournot competition and Cournot equilibrium and whether it is surprising, based on the case, that Toyota had entered the pickup truck market in the US.\nNote: Cournot competition is an economic model used to describe an industry structure in which companies compete on the amount of output they will produce, which they decide on independently of each other and at the same time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Over a few previous years consumers believed that they needed to change their oil every 10,000 miles. They have started to realize that in fact they can get away with only changing their oil every 20,000 – 30,000 miles.\n2. Historically in the U.S., 80% of the oil change market is in DIY (Do it yourself) and 20% in DIBSE (Do it by someone else). This has started to shift in favor of DIBSE. Our client Pennzoil has a 2nd position in the DIY market but only a 10th position in the DIBSE market.\n3. The CEO of Pennzoil has promised his shareholders a 200% increase in profits over the next 5 years.\nWhat do you suggest the client do?\nAdditional Information: to be provided to candidate after relevant questions \nThe DIBSE outlets can be broken down as follows:\n• 35% of the market is “Quick Lube”, of which 60% is owned by one of our major competitors such as Jiffy Lube.\n• 20% of the market is OEM related dealerships.\n• 15% is small “mom and Pop” auto shops.\n• 10% are small regional chains.\n• 5% are owned by Wal-Mart who are entering the oil change market.\nOur major DIY customer is Wal-Mart, where we are the price leader.\nThe margins in DIBSE are half the margins in DIY.\nThe client Pennzoil expects to charge $25 for an oil change and the variable costs for an oil change is $20.\nEach DIBSE garage has three bays. Each car oil change takes about 15 minutes. Car owners drive their cars themselves onto the bay.\nAdditional data for DIBSE market entry:\nFixed Costs\n• Marketing: $45,000\n• Rental of garage: $36,000\n• Equipment: $15,000\n• Utilities: $14,000\n• Fixed Labor (ask how much they expect): 5 mechanics at $40,000 each\nPossible Solution:\nNote to Interviewer: Push the candidate not to draw a framework. Just outline and discuss the issues.\nCandidate: First, I would like to explore partnering with Wal-Mart to sell to their DIBSE business.\nInterviewer: Why would Wal-Mart want to source from us?\nCandidate: I think we can leverage our relationship to Wal-Mart, pointing out that people are buying our product in the DIY segment because of our value proposition, our brand name and their trust in us. We will continue to advertise our product and people are going to ask after it. Secondly as WalMart is new to the DIBSE business – and this is not necessarily a logical progression for them – using a premium lubricant in their garages will help inspire confidence.\nInterviewer: How would you structure a deal to protect your margins in the DIY business?\nCandidate: I think we should be able to negotiate either a volume agreement, or a supply location agreement to protect our DIY business.\nInterviewer: OK, what else?\nCandidate: I think we should look at tying up a deal with the OEM garages, by focusing on the OEM producers and advertising with them we can link our brand to their cars.\nInterviewer: That is not going to work. In the US each OEM garage has the right to sell what cars he wants to and to use whatever lubricants he wants in his garage. The OEMs have no power over the individual garages.\nCandidate: OK, in which case we will need to use our brand presence in the DIY segment to create a pull effect onto the garages. For example we can co-advertise at auto shows such as the Detroit Auto show to create demand for our lubricants when they get their new, expensive, cars oil changed. This will create an incentive for individual garages to stock our product.\nInterviewer: Good. Now the client has been thinking about vertically integrating into the DIBSE business. Do you think that is a good idea?\nCandidate: It will depend on how much margin is available in that business, how easily we are able to cross sell to our existing customers and whether there are any synergies with our existing business.\nInterviewer: The client expects to charge $25 for an oil change and the variable costs for an oil change is $20. Each DIBSE garage has three bays. Each car oil change takes about 15 minutes. Car owners drive their cars themselves onto the bay.\nAnd we have the following data on the fixed costs associated with the DIBSE business:\n\nMarketing: $45,000\nRental: $36,000\nEquipment: $15,000\nUtilities: $14,000\nFixed Labor (ask how much they expect): 5 mechanics at $40,000 each\n\nCandidate: In that case, the variable contribution per car oil change is $5. The total fixed cost is $310,000. Hence we need to process $310,000/$5 = 62,000 cars per year to break even. Assuming we are open 300 days a year, we need to process around 200 cars per day to break even.\n200 cars per day – assuming a 10-hour working day, means that we need to process 20 cars per hour. Because each garage has three bays and oil change takes about 15 minutes, our capacity is only 3 * (60/15) = 12 cars per hour.\nHence, this does not make sense.\nInterviewer: So, what do you suggest?\nCandidate: Well, what we could do is to see whether we can use this opportunity to cross sell other products to the car owners while they are at our garage for oil change.\nInterviewer: Good. If we go with that strategy, our price will go up to $48 and our variable costs will increase to $28, but it will take 45 minutes to process each car.\nCandidate: OK, so our variable contribution has now increased to $20, which is 4 times higher than our previous case. Hence the number of cars we need to process to break even will drop to around 5 cars per hour per garage. Our capacity has, however, also dropped to around 3 * (60/45) = 4 cars per hour per garage, hence we still can not break even.\nInterviewer: Good. You just bump into the CEO of Pennzoil in the lift, he asks you for a summary update, what do you say?\nCandidate: The reason you are loosing profits is a shift in the industry from DIY to DIBSE. We believe we can capture some market share in DIBSE through a partnership deal with Wal-Mart, and have investigated the possibility of vertically integrating into the DIBSE garage industry – but do not currently believe that the returns justify the investments.\nOver the next couple of weeks, my team is going to work further to identify further opportunities to use your strong brand name to build your presence in the DIBSE segment.\nInterviewer: Excellent!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Little 2nd round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: banking.\nCase Interview Question #00841: Mauritius, officially the Republic of Mauritius (French: République de Maurice), is an island nation in the Indian Ocean about 1,200 miles off the southeast coast of the African continent. The country includes the island of Mauritius, Rodrigues, and the outer islands. The estimated resident population of Mauritius is about 1 million and the average income is USD $10,000 per year.\nYour client Mauritius Commercial Bank (MCB) is a commercial bank in Mauritius. The bank’s headquarters are located in Port Louis, the capital and largest city of Mauritius. Mauritius Commercial Bank has hired your consulting firm in to find ways of boosting their revenues. How can the bank increase its revenues?\nPossible Solution:\nFirst, I discussed a range of different means of revenue generation for the bank:\n(1) Interest bearing accounts: Can they offer a range of accounts targeting different parts of the market?\n(2) Credit cards: can they issue credit cards as a means of gaining additional revenue? This would depend on how wide spread credit card usage was in the Mauritius.\n(3) Extend other financial services such as insurance or share dealing options.\n(4) Look to expand to other islands such as La Reunion or other territories.\nInterviewer: Let’s focus on the opportunities available in the life insurance market. Describe whether or not a bank has any sources of competitive advantage in this market.\nCandidate: The main sources of competitive advantages are:\n\nTrust: the bank has established relationships, and people believe that the bank is going to be around long term to pay out on any life insurance policy.\nBranch presence: the bank has a wide reach, allowing easy marketing of life insurance in branch.\nInformation: the bank knows details of each customer’s accounts and can thus target those customers who would be most valuable to them.\nCross Selling: linked to the last point, the bank can cross sell to it’s existing customers.\n\nInterviewer: OK, so how large do you estimate the Mauritius life insurance market to be?\nCandidate: People who are going to buy life insurance are those who have dependents and want to leave them money in case they pass on. Let’s assume the average marriage age in Mauritius is 20 and the average lifetime is 80 years. Then total number of people who might be interested in a life insurance is around (80-20)*1,000,000 = 600,000.\nInterviewer: What price would you charge a 25 year old?\nCandidate: Present Value of future earnings will on average be a continuity of $10,000 per year for 40 years discounted to today. If we approximate this to a perpetuity and assume a 10% discount rate, then this value is $100,000. If we assume that 1/1000 25-year old die, then the cost of us of a pay out is only $100.\nAllowing some additional room for cost, profit and adverse selection, let’s say we charge $150.\nInterviewer: That sounds low, say $200, in which case how big is the market size?\nCandidate: The total market size would be about 600,000 * $200 = $120 Million.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

It is bordered by Kenya and Uganda to the north. Tanzania is one of the poorest countries in the world with a population of 52 million as of 2014. The Capital is Dodoma and the largest city is  Dar es Salaam. The neighboring Kenya has a population of approximately 45 million people as of July 2014. Kenya’s Capital and largest city is Nairobi.\nYour client is “South Beer”, a major beer producer in Tanzania. South Beer used to be the only supplier of beer in Tanzania until a few years ago when “North Beer” of Kenya entered the Tanzanian market. In retaliation South Beer entered the Kenyan market. What do you expect happened to the revenues of South Beer in the Tanzanian market?\nPossible Solution:\nFirst, ask the interviewee what could have happened. — I would expect beer prices to drop from a monopoly position based price, to a market price. North Beer entered the Tanzanian market with low prices to build market share.\nWhat else could have happened? South Beer’s cost increases:\n• South Beer’s COGS may have increased due to smaller volumes of beer being sold in Tanzania.\n• Marketing costs may have increased to stop North Beer’s entry.\n• Labor costs may have increased due to second potential employer being available.\nIn fact, after a couple of years both the Kenyan and Tanzanian parts of the beer business were making a loss. What should South Beer do?\nAdditional Information: to be provided after relevant questions\n• North Beer is also not making money.\n• North Beer has 90% market share in Kenya and South Beer has 80% market share in Tanzania.\n• We think the market share of South beer in Tanzania is worth $80M and the market share of North Beer in Kenya is worth $180M.\nAfter obtaining data on market share, I further calculated:\n• Market size of Kenya = $180M/90% = $200M\n• Market size of Tanzania = $80M/80% = $100M\n• The market share of South Beer in Kenya = $200M * 10% = $20M\n• The market share of North Beer in Tanzania = $100M * 20% = 20M\nI suggested South Beer to buy out North Beer’s share in Tanzania. However, when evaluating how much you would pay for the business you also need to consider:\n• Is the profitability of market share related to market share %, or have we captured a high profitability niche market?\n• Cost cutting opportunities\n• Cross selling opportunities\nThe interviewer then asked: How would you go about estimating future revenues streams, ignore volumes but focus on how would you get good pricing data?\n• Inflation -> get data from governmental sources\n• Analyze/compare previous inflation data to beer prices\n• Predict inflation impact on beer prices\nAfter the interview the interviewer provided the following information: eventually North Beer and South Beer bought each other out in the other’s territories and they set about a joint venture in a third country to leverage their expertise and to get used to working together.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Its products include food, beverages, cleaning agents and personal care products. It is the world’s third largest consumer  goods company measured by revenue, after Procter & Gamble and Nestlé.\nThe client Unilever is going to launch a new product and need to decide which of two alternative methods to use to go to market. One is the “direct store delivery (DSD)” system, the other is “warehouse delivery”. DSD is a business process that manufacturers sell and distribute goods directly to point of sales or retail stores, while in “warehouse delivery” system manufacturers distribute goods to retailer’s distribution center or warehouse.\nWhich one should they chose?\nAdditional Information: to be provided to candidate after relevant questions\nCurrently both systems are used by 50%.\nPer product costs through the value chain for both options:\na. Direct Store Delivery\n\nPlant: $1.75\nTo distribution center: $0.40\nIn distribution center: $0.35\nTo store: $1\nIn store: $1\nSG&A: $0.50\nTotal: $5\n\nb. Warehouse Delivery\n\nPlant: $1.75\nRetailer distribution center: $0.30\nRetailer ships: $0.70\nStore clerk merchandiser: $0.25\nTotal: $3\n\nPossible Solution:\nNote: Profitability is the main driver. Therefore the candidate needs to compare the cost structures of both delivery options through the value chain and potential revenues. But never forget to consider other issues.\nThe important point in this case was not to limit the analysis with the profitability per product. There are also qualitative issues (which can be quantified if the interviewer has data) to consider in order to come up with a recommendation.\nCandidate: My recommendation to our client will be based on the most profitable delivery system. Therefore I will first compare both systems in terms of costs and revenue potential.\nInterviewer: Good. (Then I got the above data).\nPer product costs through the value chain for both options:\na. Direct Store Delivery\n\nPlant: $1.75\nTo distribution center: $0.40\nIn distribution center: $0.35\nTo store: $1\nIn store: $1\nSG&A: $0.50\nTotal: $5\n\nb. Warehouse Delivery\n\nPlant: $1.75\nRetailer distribution center: $0.30\nRetailer ships: $0.70\nStore clerk merchandiser: $0.25\nTotal: $3\n\nCandidate: So direct store delivery seems more costly. What are the prices we charge for both?\nInterviewer: Price per product charged in direct store delivery is $7 and $6 for warehouse delivery.\nCandidate: So contribution margin for direct store delivery is $7-$5 = $2 and it is $6-$3 = $3 for warehouse delivery.\nInterviewer: So will you recommend warehouse delivery?\nCandidate: Not so quick. I presume that direct store delivery might have some advantages over warehouse delivery that affects sales positively. So at the end, direct store delivery may be more profitable.\nInterviewer: Like what?\nCandidate: We probably attach more importance to keep our products in healthy conditions in our own distribution centers. We can take additional precautions to prevent waste. However the retailers might not be that sensitive because most of the cases they return the waste products to the manufacturers.\nSecond, we can also ship with less damage, because our current trucks that we use in direct delivery are designed for our own products. However the retailer is carrying lots of stuff.\nIn direct delivery, our own employees will put our products to the shelves. They take care of shelf design more than the retailer.\nAll those factors might contribute to the sales increase.\nInterviewer: Good. Thank you!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

When measured in terms of total assets and deposits, Capital One is the eighth-largest bank holding company in the United States. The company helped pioneer the mass marketing of credit cards in the 1990s. Its corporate headquarter is located in Tysons Corner, Virginia.\nOur client is the head of credit card division of Capital One Financial. In spite of the recent increase in customers over the last 3 years, the credit card division’s profits are not showing a significant growth. What do you think is happening? What course of actions can be taken to improve Capital One credit card division’s profitability?\nPossible Answer: \nCandidate: Are we targeting a different customer base than we used to target earlier?\nInterviewer: Yes. In order to be a bigger player, we are looking at expanding our customer base. We have included younger age group (age 20-30) and lower middle income group people to boost our revenues.\nCandidate: Has the default ratios increased? Possibly due to inclusion of lower middle income group and younger section of the society, number of people defaulting has increased. These are the people who generally don’t have stable source of income to repay their credit card debts.\nInterviewer: Yes, you are right. However, the company expected this. Therefore in order to cover these losses, we have been charging higher interest rates from these people. Also in order to lower the default ratios, we have increased our credit period from 2 months to 4 months.\nCandidate: Increase in credit period puts the strain on the requirements of the working capital of the company. The company’s borrowing costs increases to service this increase in working capital requirements. Has the increase in credit period resulted in significant reduction in default rates?\nInterviewer: To some extent yes. What else do you think would be happening from the operations side?\nCandidate: Due to the increase in number of customers, the company had to expand its operations. It had to open more branch outlets and hire more employees. However, since the billing amounts are significantly less for the newer customer base as compared to the previous ones, processing costs have increased as a share of overall revenues. Also since the number of defaults has increased, the company might have to pay higher litigation costs in order to recover the loans.\nInterviewer: Very well done. You have explored most of the areas. However, I would like you to pinpoint some further issues that might be affecting the company.\nCandidate: Have we seen any changes in the competitive scenario?\nInterviewer: A number of small players have entered the markets who offer attractive discounts at certain merchandises to boost their market share.\nCandidate: We know that the number of customers have increased. However, this might not have led to increase in share of customer’s wallet. Due to more competitors, customers might be tempted to keep more credit cards. Hence our share in billings would have actually declined.\nInterviewer: Very good, thank you!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Its products include passenger cars, trucks, vans, coaches, buses, construction equipment and military vehicles. It is the world’s 17th-largest motor vehicle manufacturing company, fourth largest truck manufacturer, and second largest bus manufacturer by volume.\nYou are having tea with Mr. Ratan Tata, the chairman of Tata Group. He has just returned from a business trip in Germany where he saw third party car service stations were doing very well in Germany. So, Mr. Tata is thinking of opening a chain of such car service stations in India. You need to give him your thoughts and make a pitch from a management consulting firm’s side for helping him with the project. What would you do?\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate: I’m not very sure of what you mean by third party service stations. Can you explain a little?\nInterviewer: To service a car there are service stations. They can be car manufacturer authorized stations like the chain that Maruti Suzuki has or they can be local garages. The third type, which is currently missing in India, is an independent chain of service stations which will service any brand of cars. These are third party service stations.\nCandidate: OK. This is a new business that Tata Group would want to enter. I’d like to look at a few things while considering the new venture:\n\nTata’s final aim – do they have a target profit or market share or return on assets (ROA) as their target from the venture?\nMarket scenario – growth rate & market size, competition\nTata’s capabilities – financial capability, expertise in the new area, synergies with other businesses\n\nInterviewer: Tata Group is a big and profitable company, they want as high profits as possible from the new venture. Also, they have no constraints with regards to finances. They build automobiles as you know and have authorized service stations for their own automobiles.\nCandidate: So, the aim of Tata is high profits and they have sufficient finances and expertise in the automobile area. I’ll go on to look at the automobile maintenance market. Currently in India there are 2 kinds of garages – the local ones and car manufacturer authorized service stations. So, when we enter the market of third party service stations, would we be servicing all kinds of brands and providing a full range of services?\nInterviewer: Yes. All brands and a full range of services.\nCandidate: We would need to differentiate ourselves from the 2 kinds of competitors that we have in order to get customers.\nInterviewer: OK, how would you do that?\nCandidate: I’ll look at why a customer goes to a car service station and why he chooses a particular service station to go to.\nA car would be taken to a service station for:\n\nRegular check-ups/services\nIn case of an accident\nMaintenance when it breaks down\n\nInterviewer: OK.\nCandidate: Now, when a car owner chooses a service station he would want:\n\nQuality – In terms of genuine parts if replacements are done, trained mechanics, the car being treated properly, delivery on time\nCost – He would want the service to be as cheap as possible\nConvenience – The service station should be close or should have a pick & drop service.\n\nThere would be a segment of customers who would lay a lot of emphasis on cost while another segment would lay emphasis on quality. In case of an accident or break-down convenience would play a big role. Local garages will have low quality and low cost while car manufacturer authorized service stations will have high quality and high cost. Also, local garages are generally more in number so would be more convenient to reach in most cases.\nInterviewer: OK. Now I want you to make a grid of the dimensions that you have mentioned and figure out where our competitors lie and where we should go.\nCandidate: (Starts drawing a 2X2 matrix)\n\nInterviewer: Let us club convenience with quality. We’ll just analyze the situation based on 2 parameters: cost and quality.\nCandidate: Now, Tata wants to start a third party chain of service stations which will serve all brands. If Tata targets low quality, local garages will beat them since these garages can service all brands and charge very low unbeatable prices. Also, they would be built at strategic locations which Tata may not be able to acquire, or coming late into the market. On comparing Tata’s third party stations with authorized service stations, Tata could stand a chance. They could ensure quality by sourcing parts from manufacturing companies and employing well trained mechanics. Since such a third party service station will service all brands it will be a convenient place to come to for high quality services. However, the price charged will be high.\nInterviewer: Do you think anyone will come to such a third party service station when they can go to a Maruti Suzuki or Hyundai authorized service station?\nCandidate: In India a majority of cars are Maruti Suzuki and Maruti has a very good chain of service stations which are convenient to reach and high quality. Hence, Maruti cars will definitely not come to Tata’s stations. Other brands like Hyundai would come since their service stations are few and far apart. If Tata offers the same quality at the same price, it might be cheaper & more convenient for consumers if Tata’s chain has numerous stations at strategic locations.\nInterviewer: Maruti Suzuki has almost 50% of India’s car market share. Now do you think it is beneficial to set up Tata’s third party service chain?\nCandidate: Owners of other car brands will prefer to go to their authorized service stations as they would be more trusted. And given such a lopsided market in favor of Maruti Suzuki, it will be difficult for us to compete with Maruti directly. So, the number of cars coming to Tata’s stations might be too low for the venture to be viable. But, if there are expectations that many new car brands will enter India as some already have, then Tata’s venture could be viable given that these firms would not want to open a service chain of their own due to small numbers and newer vehicles could mean that the local garages might not be well-equipped to deal with all kinds of problems with the vehicle.\nInterviewer: So, what would your final recommendation be?\nCandidate: My final recommendation would be to not start such a venture currently since Tata would not be able to beat competitors on any dimension – cost or quality. However, in the near future this business could turn sustainable so an eye should be kept on this market.\nInterviewer: OK. Thanks!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Moreover, since it is only a build project, I think costs become highly important as our revenue remains from only one source.\nInterviewer: Yeah, that seems a good way to begin. So let us look at the costs now.\nCandidate: Even within costs, I think our foremost concern should be to identify the possible reasons for the $50 million escalation. Is there any specific reason that the client has shared with us?\nInterviewer: Not really, I think you will have to figure that out as well.\nCandidate: So, I will start with different factors contributing to the cost.\nInterview: OK.\nCandidate: Raw materials would be a major component of the costs. Here, if the company has long term sourcing contracts then I don’t think it would have contributed to cost increase. Do we have any information about their sourcing contracts?\nInterviewer: No.\nCandidate: In that case, we can also look at the option of negotiating prices with the suppliers if the company has a high bargaining power with them.\nInterviewer: OK, these two options look fine.\nCandidate: Further, maybe we can also explore low cost substitutes for existing raw materials. In case if we can alter the product mix, even that option should be looked at.\nInterviewer: Don’t you think these options will impact the quality of the road?\nCandidate: At all times while considering these options, we should set certain minimum quality standards as per norms and then see if we can reduce costs.\nInterviewer: That seems fine.\nCandidate: Apart from raw material costs, I believe that we should also look at the equipment costs. Here a decision to either lease the equipment or buy it needs to be taken.\nInterviewer: Can you explain what will be the basis for such a decision?\nCandidate: It will depend on the scope of future projects. If this is a one-off project of its kind, then the company should lease the equipment. Otherwise, if the company plans or is executing similar projects, they can buy the equipment. In such a case they can depreciate the costs across different projects.\nInterviewer: You can move onto other costs now.\nCandidate: Labor and employee costs need to be very well planned. Since the construction project is expected to last for 4 years, there can be a substantial increase in these costs. Can you let me know whether the company has its own employees or hires a contractor?\nInterviewer: The contractor brings in most of the employees.\nCandidate: I think in such a project, the speed of the project to a large extent would be determined by the amount of labor used. Maybe we can go in for more employees or ask the current workers to work overtime. This will reduce the duration of the project and increase the net present value (NPV).\nInterviewer: Do you think employees would work overtime?\nCandidate: They might, but a better option would be to consider working multiple shifts.\nInterviewer: Yeah, that could possibly be tried. Any other cost that you would like to take into account.\nCandidate: I think even the financing costs would play a major role depending on the capital structure of the project. Will the project amount of USD $800 million be paid in phases or only upon completion of the project?\nInterviewer: Money will only be paid upon completion of the project and due to this a significant portion of financing will come through debt.\nCandidate: This will result in significant interest costs that will have to be paid during the project.\nInterviewer: Also, the client company is using a percentage completion method of accounting. Anything about the working capital financing that you can think of?\nCandidate: The employee wages and raw material payments would form a significant portion of the working capital. We can look at negotiating the credit period with our suppliers but given the 4-year span of the project, I think that this cost will still be substantial. In case of employee wages, I think that they would have to be paid daily.\nInterviewer: So is there a way to address this concern?\nCandidate: Maybe we can go back to the state government and renegotiate the payment terms such that the amount of USD $800 million is paid in installments rather than only at the completion of the project.\nInterviewer: If this doesn’t work out, what other options will you suggest?\nCandidate: The client company could drop the contract but in that case it will have to estimate the impact of such a decision on its reputation and ability to get future contracts. Also, a penalty might need to be paid in this case.\nInterviewer: Would you suggest the client company to go ahead with the current project even if the terms remain unchanged?\nCandidate: Yes, the company can consider this project to be a real option for future projects. Maybe they will incur a loss of USD $50 million on this project, but it will enable them to bid for other projects in the future.\nInterviewer: Good justification. I believe we have had a good discussion. Thank You!\nComments: This “cost cutting” case tested the candidate on his/her ability to identify the problem areas. The candidate guided the entire case discussion with the interviewer only supporting it in between. The focus of the case was to explore all possibilities related to planning a project and generating alternatives to come up with solutions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The company was founded under the name Roland Berger Strategy Consultants in 1967 by Roland Berger. In 2011, the company’s revenues were roughly USD $1.2 billion. The company, with around 2,400 employees worldwide, is an independent partnership wholly owned by its approximately 220 partners. Corporate organization is based on global offices, referred to as “competence centers”, along functional and industry lines. As of 2015 it has a total of 50 offices in 36 countries around the world.\nRoland Berger operates as a generalist strategy consultancy and advises its clients on various management issues. Roland Berger provides restructuring and marketing advice, but its practice areas also include corporate development, corporate finance, information management, operations strategy, performance improvement, and strategy development. While its clientele is largely in the automobile industry and the capital goods sector, other industry specialties include energy and chemicals, engineered products and high-tech, financial services, information communications, pharmaceuticals and health care, public services, and transportation.\nDraw the income statement for Roland Berger.\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate: When drawing up the income statement for the firm, I would have to write down revenues and costs. Shall I start with revenues?\nInterviewer: Sure, let’s look at revenues first.\nCandidate: The main source of revenue for the firm would be through consulting fees. I can estimate this in two ways – by estimating the demand for our services, or by estimating it from the supply side. Which method do you think I should use?\nInterviewer: Which method do you think is more feasible?\nCandidate: I think estimating it from the supply side would be easier if we charge our clients on a per hour per consultant basis. Is that the case?\nInterviewer: Yes indeed that is the case. We charge our clients on a per hour basis.\nCandidate: In that case, I am assuming that the rate charged will vary according to the position of the consultant. A principal or a partner would charge a significantly higher rate than a junior or associate consultant. Is my assumption right?\nInterviewer: Spot on. To simplify things, assume there are 4 levels of consultants: Junior Consultant, Consultant, Engagement Manager, and Partner, and their rates are $300/hour, $500/hour, $1,000/hour and $2,000/hour, respectively.\nCandidate: Alright. As far as I know, Roland Berger has 4 offices in North America: in Chicago, Detroit, Boston and Montreal. The Chicago office has around 60 consultants, with 3 partners. Can I get some information on how they are distributed across the hierarchy?\nInterviewer: You can assume that there are 30 in the “Junior Consultant” level, 20 in the “Consultant”, 7 in the “Engagement Manager” and as you said, 3 in the “Partner” level.\nCandidate: With this information, I can calculate the number of hours that the consultants at different levels work, multiply that with the rates and get a total number for the revenue.\nInterviewer: To save time, I would not like you to do all the calculations. Could you just outline how you would go about finding the number of work hours for the consultants?\nCandidate: I can first assume that each consultant puts in around 50 hours a week, and multiply it with 52 weeks to get the number of chargeable hours in a year. From this number, we will have to subtract hours for a number of reasons like:\n\nHolidays taken by consultants\nTime spent in between projects\nTime spent on pro-bono projects or non-revenue generating projects, such as knowledge creation.\n\nInterviewer: That seems pretty much exhaustive. Though I must say that your 50 hours per week might be a little too conservative (chuckles). So do you think that the number you get after accounting for all this will be the same for consultants across the hierarchy?\nCandidate: No. As you go up the hierarchy, your role will gradually shift from consulting to developing business and meeting clients. This will also lead to a lot of travelling during the week itself. Although the total number of hours put in by them might be higher than the average, due to these factors I think their chargeable hours will be lesser than the junior consultants.\nInterviewer: That’s right. This pretty much summarizes the revenue from consulting services. Now let’s move to the cost side. What will be the different costs incurred?\nCandidate: The different costs incurred would be as follows:\n\nSalaries of consultants (and other functions)\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nSubscription fees for international knowledge repositories, business journals, etc.\nBusiness Development expenses – to meet new clients, and bid for projects\nMarketing costs\n\nInterviewer: That seems to be the gist of it. Since we are really running short on time, could you tell me which of these would form the major chunk of our costs?\nCandidate: The salaries would definitely the biggest chunk of all costs.\nInterviewer: Yes indeed, but there’s another cost which is significantly higher than all the other costs apart from salaries. What will that be? You might want to expand your General and Admin expenses head.\nCandidate: The general and admin expenses will mainly consist of computers/software, office rental and other miscellaneous expenses. Among these, office rental will be the highest because the location of the offices are generally in big expensive cities.\nInterviewer: Exactly. Office rent forms a pretty big part of our costs. I guess that should be it. Thanks for your time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new product, new technology.\nConsulting Firm: Boston Consulting Group (BCG) 2nd round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: paper products; food & beverages.\nCase Interview Question #00864: Our client Nordic Paper AS is a paper manufacturing company operating in Norway and Sweden. Their product is grease-proof paper which they sell in rolls to “bag converters”. Bag converters are companies which combine 2-ply paper, popcorn, oil, and a “receptor” to make microwaveable popcorn. When microwaved, the “receptor” gets hot and pops the corn. Bag converters supply directly to retailers.\nOur client company Nordic Paper uses wood pulp and chemicals to make grease-proof paper. A recent innovation at the R&D department has increased the grease resistance of our paper by 10 times. The client needs help in deciding on whether to switch its production facilities to manufacture this new type of paper. This is an either/or decision. Should Nordic Paper adopt the new technology to make grease-proof paper? Why or why not?\nAdditional Information: to be provided to candidate after relevant questions\n• The client company Nordic Paper is already operating at full capacity.\n• The market is pretty small: only 4 primary competitors dominate it.\n• Customers don’t care much about how grease-proof the paper is.\nThe costs to a bag converter are (currently):\n• 30 cents – 2-ply paper bag\n• 10 cents – receptor\n• 5 cents – popcorn and oil\n• 5 cents — assembly\n• Our current cost of producing the grease-proof paper are (per 2-ply paper bag) 25 cents\n• This cost is 50% fixed and 50% variable\nPossible Solution:\nMy approach was to evaluate the additional value to customer (bag converters) and compare it with the cost of switching to the new manufacturing process.\nFirst, I wanted to understand the benefit of this innovation. As end consumers don’t care about the grease, we have to look to bag converters. I suggested that they might be able to switch to 1-ply bags now, an important change because bags represent 60% of their costs.\nThe interviewer confirmed this.\nProceeding from this assumption, I stated that as long as we could charge less than the current 30 cents per bag, the bag converters would be willing to purchase our product (there is no additional cost to them to use 1-ply instead of 2-ply).\nThe interviewer told me to ignore our switching costs and to look at maintaining profitability.\nI then evaluated change in our costs:\n• I assumed that fixed cost per bag will remain the same (50% * 25 cents = 12.5 cents)\n• I assumed that variable cost per bag would be cut in half (50% * 50% * 25 cents = 6.25 cents)\nThe interviewer confirmed these assumptions.\nThen, the total cost per bag to us becomes 12.5 + 6.25 = 18.75 cents.\nIn order to maintain the current profit margin (30 cents – 25 cents = 5 cents), we need to charge at least 18.75 + 5 = 23.75 cents per bag.\nThis is a good deal to the bag converter, who currently pays 30 cents/bag.\n(You can look on this on per-sheet basis, instead of per-bag basis. In that case, you need to make twice as much profit per sheet because you are selling only half the volume. You should then charge at least 18.75 + 2*5 = 28.75 per bag. This is still better than the current 30 cents.)\nStrategic Implications:\n• This is a profitable proposal for both us and our customers bag converters.\n• As we are currently at full capacity, this innovation would in effect double our capacity.\n• We could capture some new business and increase our market share by selling this cheaper, better paper, and now we have the capacity to meet this increased demand.\n• We should implement the new technology as soon as possible and lock in bag converters in long-term contracts before our competitors can replicate this innovation.\n• There will be switching costs, such as downtime, training, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Champion Energy currently serves residential, governmental, commercial and industrial customers in deregulated electric energy markets in Texas, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York. After entering the market in 2005, Champion has seen strong growth and currently serves around 2,000,000 residential customer equivalents, with a peak load of near 4,500 megawatts.\nThe client Champion Energy’s power plant is currently operating at nearly full capacity. The President and CEO of Champion Energy is deciding on whether to make a capital investment to expand their capacity. A capital investment of $100 million is proposed to build a new power plant. Our consulting firm has been hired to help him make a final decision. How should we advise him?\nAdditional Information: to be provided to candidate after relevant questions\n• $100M investment to produce 2,000 units/week (units are Megawatts of electricity).\n• The client uses natural gas fired generators to produce electricity.\n• Variable costs are gas and labor, gas costs $40/unit and labor is $10/unit.\n• Market price of electricity is $100/unit.\nPossible Solution:\nCandidate: What are the fixed costs involved in the investment?\nInterviewer: $100M investment to produce 2,000 units/week (units are Megawatts of electricity).\nCandidate: Before assessing the fixed costs, I want to know what are the major inputs (i.e. raw materials) used in generating electricity.\nInterviewer: Our client uses natural gas fired generators.\nCandidate: OK, so, I think that the major variable costs involved would be the following:\n• Natural Gas\n• Labor\n• Distribution – infrastructure to connect utility grid\nWhat are the actual costs for each of these buckets of costs?\nInterviewer: Let’s say that the variable costs are natural gas and labor, gas costs $40/unit and labor is $10/unit.\nCandidate: OK, so now that we have looked at both the fixed and variable costs involved, I would like to assess the potential revenue that may be generated from this capital investment.\nGiven that electricity is a commodity product, I would like to know the current market price of electricity in our client’s market.\nInterviewer: $100/unit. Given the data you have now, will this investment be profitable in the long-run and how long would it take to pay-back?\nCandidate: Calculate contribution margin and assume they are able to sell the full capacity of 2,000 units/week.\nRevenue = 2,000 units/week * $100/unit = $200,000/week\nVariable Cost = $50/unit * 2000 units/week = $100,000/week\nProfit = $200,000 – $100,000 = $100,000/week or $5,200,000/year\nSo, the payback period for this investment is $100M/$5.2M = ~20 years\nInterviewer: How would you evaluate whether this was an appropriate investment?\nCandidate: Based on the payback period of 20 years, I would compare the payback period to the useful life of the new plant.\nInterviewer: The useful life is approximately 30 years. What else could you do?\nCandidate: Look at the payback period of similar investments our company has made to determine if this was in-line with this payback period of those investments. I could also use industry benchmarks.\nInterviewer: Good. The payback period for similar investments is between 15-20 years. What else should you consider in assessing this investment?\nCandidate: Since this analysis assumed 100% capacity utilization, I would want to do further sensitivity analysis to test that assumption. For example, what would be the impact on our model of revenue if there was not enough demand to justify the new capacity?\nInterviewer: That’s a good point, how would you go about estimating new demand for electricity.\nCandidate: So, the things that drive new electricity demand would be new home starts, business growth – i.e. industrial complexes, growth in consumer devices that use electricity, such as white goods.\nInterviewer: What other trends or areas would you look at?\nCandidate: I would look at consumption trends such as the move towards low energy appliances and how that might impact the projections.\nI would also look at the moves that competitors are making, i.e. the impact that new capacity from competitors might have on my ability to set prices.\nInterviewer: Very good. So, what is your final recommendation?\nCandidate: (Synthesis and Recommendation) Given that the projected payback period of 20 years is within same range as similar investments, I would recommend that the CEO go ahead with the capital investment after considering some of the risks mentioned (the sensitivity of demand and potential competitor moves).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The company opened its first store in the 1970s, pioneering the electronics  superstore format in the 1990s. Currently there are more than 300 Circuit City Superstores nationwide located in all major cities across the US.\nThe client Circuit City is considering the introduction of private label brands into their superstores. Private label brands are unbranded products made by an OEM (original equipment manufacturer). Is there any value in this product line? If yes, what are the sources of value of this program? What are the potential downside risks associated with introducing private label products?\nAdditional Information: to be provided to candidate after relevant questions \n• The client currently has more than 300 stores nationwide.\n• Private label brands are unbranded products made by an original equipment manufacturer (OEM).\n• Profit margins are high on low end products; high end branded products have slightly lower profit margins.\n• Selling a branded televisions currently offers them 30% margins while a similar private label product would give them 35%.\nPossible Solution:\n1. Downside potential\nBrand erosion: Customer may perceive us to be a discounter resulting in an inability to charge premium prices or sell high-end products.\nSupplier backlash: Suppliers may not want to supply their products to us if we introduce the private label products. It may cannibalize sales of their items or they may fear brand erosion from supplying our stores.\nPoor product knowledge: Thus far we have only been a retailer, never a producer. Thus we have no competency in the product area and may be taking on too much risk given the mediocre rewards available.\n2. Sources of value:\nPromotion: We will be able to price the private label products more competitively and generate additional traffic in our stores.\nProduct knowledge: By, in a sense, becoming a supplier we are making a vertical move that could increase our product knowledge and, consequently, supplier power.\nBecoming a supplier: Because we are supplying to ourselves, we could also supply to other retailers like Best Buy, Systemax, etc. This may give us more power in the relationship with the OEMs. We may be able to move into other product lines and create a well known private label brand.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Headquartered in Muscatine, Iowa, it has manufacturing facilities located throughout the United States, and sells its products through a nationwide network of dealers and retailers. The HON Company is the largest operating company of HNI Corporation (NYSE: HNI).\nRecently, Our client The HON Company is concerned that their stock price is not growing as fast as their competitors’. Furthermore, the client’s annual growth is 1% per year, while that of main competitors’ is 10% per year. Also, our client’s EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margin is only 10% while competitors’ EBIT is 20%. Your team is brought in to help address their concerns. What would be your recommendations for our client?\nAdditional Information: to be provided to candidate after relevant questions \n1. Market\n• Overall market of office furniture grows 1% per year (no market size info)\n• We are the market leader with 20% market share. The other three main competitors have 10% each. The rest of the market is fragmented.\n• 3 main competitors have prices that are 10% lower than ours.\n2. Customer\n• Client’s customers are composed of two segments.\na. Segment 1: Fortune 500 companies – 80% of our sales.\nb. Segment 2: channel sales to small companies – 20% of our sales. We don’t own these channels.\n• Customers are looking for furniture that is hassle free, i.e., universal, will fit in all offices, goes with each other etc.\n3. Company\nOur client’s product is viewed as being superior and we have a strong brand.\n4. Cost\n• For the sake of simplicity, ignore fixed costs.\n• We assume that competitors’ material, other costs and SG&A for one product are the same as ours. Our COGS break down into materials (40%), direct labor (40%), overhead (20%).\n• We know that the competitors have probably the same material cost, overhead and SG&A per product (in dollars, not as a percentage of price). However we don’t know anything about their labor cost. Can you calculate it? Assume that we sell our typical product for $100/unit. Calculate the labor cost of the competitors for the same product.\nPossible Solution:\n1. Qualitative Analysis\nFirst, I decided to stick to the growth framework: market, customer, company, competitors, ability to build competitive advantage.\nI have a hypothesis that the client has ineffective production process because of different throughput rates in their production processes. I have the following suggestions:\n• Train less efficient workers\n• Resource pulling\n• Resource reallocation.\n• If resource pulling is impossible, build production lines based on performance of workers, e.g. get more efficient works into one line and less efficient works into other.\n• Provide less efficient workers with more efficient tools.\nHowever, if we aren’t able to sell more, we will not be able to realize saving from higher capacity utilization. In this case, we could change incentive system to have more efficient workers produce less.\nInterviewer: That’s correct. However, we would like to realize these potential savings. What could we do?\nTo realize savings, we have two broad possibilities: (1) Lay off people. (2) Increase sales.\nInterviewer: Laying off people is not acceptable, so let’s concentrate on increasing sales.\nTo increase sales, the client could:\n• Go into service business providing integrated solutions to the Fortune 500 customers.\n• Acquire one or two of the main competitors to benefit from their higher growth rate and realizing increased capacity utilization.\n• Increase sales force efforts.\n2. Quantitative Analysis\nCalculate the labor cost of competitors\nPossible Answer:\nCompetitors labor cost is $18/unit, which means competitors have an $18 labor cost advantage per typical product. Answer calculated using the table below. To Interviewer: do not give the table to the interviewee, make them construct it.\nIf our price is $100/unit, and our EBIT margin is 10% or $10, then our COGS = $100 – $10 = $90. Break the COGS down into materials (40%), direct labor (40%), overhead (20%), that will give us materials – $36; direct labor – $36; overhead – $18.\nCompetitors have prices that are 10% lower than ours, so their price will be $90/unit. Their EBIT margin is 20% or $18. Therefore, the following table can be built.\n\n\n\n\nWe\nCompetitor\n\n\nPrice\n$100\n$90\n\n\nCOGS\n\n\n\n\n- materials\n40% ($36)\n$36 (same as ours)\n\n\n- labor\n40% ($36)\n$90-$36-$18-$18 = $18\n\n\n- overhead\n20% ($18)\n$18 (same as ours)\n\n\n= EBIT\n10% ($10)\n20% ($18)\n\n\n\nOur labor costs are higher because this is the policy of our company. We hire the best people and pay them more. They produce higher quality products and we charge premium for them. We don’t want to pay less or lay people off. We pay on per-unit base. But some people are more productive than others, you know.\nSee the solution Part 2 “Qualitative Analysis” for a brief discussion on manufacturing process. If the interviewee gets to this problem quickly feel free to make up some numbers or an operations portion of the case.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The company is engaged in automotive parts and building materials business. Dana provides the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and the aftermarket with local product and service support through a network of nearly 100 engineering, manufacturing, and distribution facilities.\nThe client company Dana has experienced rapid growth in the past through acquisition. Currently, it is composed of the following three divisions:\n• Automotive parts division #1 – this has three different areas within the division.\n• Construction materials division.\n• Automotive parts division #3 – this division owns four separate companies.\nThe CEO of Dana Holding Corporation would like you to identify consolidation and off-shoring opportunities within the organization. What would you do?\nAdditional Information: to be provided to candidate after relevant questions\n\nAuto parts division #1 produces metallic parts and sells to original-equipment manufacturers (OEM).\nConstruction materials division produces plumping, electrical, and other building materials. Their customers are construction companies.\nAuto parts division #3 produces rubber parts and sells to OEM’s.\nThe client company Dana does not operate any call centers.\nAuto parts businesses ship directly from its plants to customer plants (there are no warehouses).\n\nPossible Solution:\nI looked at areas of opportunity and then identified off shoring and consolidation opportunities for each area. It was very important to identify levels at which consolidation can occur.\nInitial Structure:\nCost (tailor to specific industries)\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A)\nProperty, Plant and Equipment (PP&E)\nPurchasing\nOther Operational:\n\nDistribution\nDesign Services\nBest Practices in general\n\n\n\nRevenue\n\nCross-selling\n\nMain opportunities are between auto parts areas. Due to different automotive products, I recommend that automotive divisions remain separate, but there is opportunity to consolidate much of these businesses.\n1. Cost\na. SG&A (Selling, General and Administrative Expenses)\nSelling – Should consolidate sales forces across automotive divisions. I would like to see a central director over both to ensure use of best practices. We should be able to have sales people who rep all of the rubber companies instead of individual reps for each subsidiary.\nG&A – Accounting, Billing, Finance, should be consolidated to reduce cost and improve quality. Billing, some accounting, and some finance can be sent to India. This has been common in many industries and should not be difficult to accomplish.\nb. Property, Plant and Equipment (PP&E)\nSince much of SG&A is being consolidated we can combine some/all of our headquarters.\nUtilization – We need to see where there is opportunity to consolidate and achieve high levels of manufacturing and design utilization (balanced with growth plans). Main areas are across metallic auto, across rubber auto, and maybe minor opportunities with metallic auto and construction.\nFoot print rationalization – Balance this with customer locations/distribution and manufacturing costs. Could be big opportunities to send manufacturing to China.\nc. Purchasing\nThis must be centralized to maximize our buyer power across all three areas and reduce headcount.\nd. Other Operational\nDistribution – Main opportunities between auto areas. These divisions share customers.

You may be tempted to go to OEM’s as central supplier and even offer integrated solutions, but this will not give you supplier power with them. It would likely make you a bigger target for price givebacks. Integrated solutions have been popular with the OEM’s, but suppliers are less profitable in these arrangements. Therefore, I would keep separate rubber and metallic salespeople and products, but leverage network and best practices.

Kearney first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage:  None\nCase Interview Question #00850: Your client ABC company is a large B2B company. Business to business (B2B) refers to a situation where one company makes a commercial transaction with another. This typically occurs when:\n\nA company is sourcing materials for their production process, e.g. a food manufacturer purchasing salt.\nA company needs the services of another for operational reasons, e.g. a food manufacturer employing an accountancy firm to audit their finances.\nA company re-sells goods and services produced by others, e.g. a retailer buying the end product from the food manufacturer.\n\nYour client ABC company has one main customer, XYZ company. Revenues from XYZ company have been declining. How should they grow revenues from XYZ?\nAdditional Information: to be provided to candidate after relevant questions\n\nThis is a generic “increase revenues” type of case and the aim is to discuss issues that are relevant to almost any industry/company.\nRevenue from XYZ company represents 30% of ABC’s revenues.\nABC company has over 100 customers in total, and XYZ is the largest one.\n\nPossible Solution:\nThis is a very broad case, so the candidate should outline potential issues and how they could be addressed. Using business logic and explaining rationale is key. One approach to cracking the case is the following.\nUnderstand why revenues from XYZ company are declining:\n• changing needs\n• dissatisfied with ABC\n• change in quality of product/service\n• price change\n• service/relationship\n• changing product mix\n• Changes in macro-economic environment\n• Changes in XYZ’s ability to compete\nBased on insights gained above we could develop solutions:\n• If needs/technology is changing, does it make sense for ABC company to begin producing new product/service or start using a new technology?\n• If XYZ is dissatisfied with ABC, try to communicate and understand the reasons behind.\n• Improve quality! Develop plan & clearly communicate to XYZ to explain plan to meet quality standards.\n• Evaluate pricing (volume, pricing matrix, etc)\n• New relationship team, faster deliveries, etc.\n• Why is product mix changing? have XYZ company’s outputs changed?\n• What is going on in macro-economic environment?\n• Recession? Does that explain the decline in revenues?\n• Is XYZ less competitive? are we part of the problem?\nAre XYZ company’s customers changing?\n• ABC may not be able to control these factors.\nLong-term/Big Picture\n• Are other customers at risk, too?\n• Is ABC company too dependent on XYZ?

Currently, our client – McCormick & Schmick’s Seafood Restaurant – has a person who shells shrimp manually. The worker needs 15 minutes to set up his work space for shelling shrimps each day. Shelling shrimps is not his main task in the restaurant. It takes him 10 min to shell one pound of shrimps. His wage is $6 per hour.\nThe owner of McCormick & Schmick’s Seafood Restaurant has been informed that it is possible to buy a machine for $3,285 that automatically shells shrimps. The machine’s useful life is 3 years. Setup time for the machine is 30 min each day. The same shrimp shelling worker will operate this machine. The machine can process 60 pounds of shrimps per hour.\nWhat is the break-even volume of shrimps needed to be processed each day to justify the investment into the machine?\nPossible Solution:\nThis short mini case aims at giving you a rough idea about the difficulty level of numerical questions you will have at McKinsey final round case interviews. It is a part of a 45-minute full case. I got it somewhere in the middle of the case.\nGet a timer. After the interviewer reads the question, you have one minute to solve the problem. In the real interview you will have maybe 2 minutes but you should be able to solve it in 1 minute to be able to solve it in real interview setting in 2 minutes.\nCalculation:\nAssume 365 working days for the seafood restaurant. 3 years = 365 * 3 = 1,095 days.\nCost of shrimp shelling machine per day = $3,285/1,095 = $3.\nSo, we need to recover $3 per day for the machine cost.\nAlso, we get additional setup time of 30-15 = 15 min per day, i.e. $1.5.\nThus, we need to recover $3 + $1.5 = $4.5.\nThe worker can shell 6 pounds of shrimp per hour manually. Variable cost of shelling per pound of shrimp is $6/6 pounds = $1/pound.\nNow, with the machine, this will be $6/60 pounds = $0.1/pound. So, we will save $0.9 variable cost per pound of shrimp.\nTo recover $4.5 with $0.9 cost saving per pound, we need to process $4.5/0.9 = 5 pounds to break even.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

A live dinosaur has just been found in Central Africa and will be auctioned off. There is only one dinosaur. Your client would like to buy the dinosaur and use it as the centerpiece in a new animal themed park he would like to open. He would like to engage your help in addressing three specific questions:\n\nWhat is the maximum price that our client should bid for the dinosaur?\nHow should the theme park be designed to maximize profits?\nOur client will need to go to the financial markets to raise capital to buy the dinosaur and to build the theme park. How would you determine an appropriate discount rate?\n\nHow would you go about this case?\nAdditional Information: to be provided to candidate after relevant questions\nThis case was given in several parts. When giving this case discuss the first question in detail and move on to each subsequent question. \nThe interviewer should push the interviewee to make reasonable assumptions for all data that is needed. The only piece of additional information provided was that the theme park will be in a major metropolitian area in a developed, Western country, e.g. New York City, London, Paris.\nPossible Solution:\nEssentially this is a pricing and valuation case. To determine the maximum price it is necessary to figure out the amount of profit that can be made by opening a dinosaur theme park. Profit = Revenue – Cost\nRevenue = number of visitors x ticket price + ancillary sales (food, souvenirs, marketing promotions, etc.)\nCosts = Fixed costs (building/set up of facility, dinosaur purchase) + Variable costs\nAssuming that there will be a virtually unlimited number of people who want to see the world’s only dinosaur, the number of visitors is determined by capacity. Therefore, designing the theme park to maximum capacity is key. To determine the capacity you must figure out the best layout for the exhibit.\nThere is no right answer here, but it is important to evaluate alternatives and propose the “best” solution. The interviewee should draw out several potential alternatives and calculate capacity using Little’s Law: R = I x T.\nNote: In queueing theory, a discipline within the mathematical theory of probability, Little’s result, theorem, lemma, law or formula is a theorem by John Little which states: The long-term average number of customers in a stable system R is equal to the long-term average effective arrival rate, I, multiplied by the (Palm‑)average time a customer spends in the system, T; or expressed algebraically: R = I x T.\nDetermining an appropriate discount rate may not be possible, but the interviewee should propose a methodology for determining the rate using benchmarks. The key is to find benchmarks for companies/industries where the key asset has an indeterminate life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

(NYSE: CAH) is a Fortune 500 health care services company based in Dublin, Ohio, United States. The company specializes in distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical products, serving more than 100,000 locations. Cardinal Health provides medical products to over 75 percent of hospitals in the United States.\nCordis Corporation is a medical device company that develops and manufactures heart stents. Heart stents are small “tubes” that keep arteries propped open during open heart surgery. They are left in afterwards to prevent the arteries from collapsing. Alternatives to heart stents are drugs or not using anything.\nRecently the client Cardinal Health agreed to acquire Cordis Corporation. The CEO of Cardinal Health feels that the previous management of Cordis had not maximized the market potential for their heart stent products. He has asked you to (1) determine what the potential market size is, as well as (2) determine the best method to distribute the heart stent products.\nAdditional Information: to be provided to candidate after relevant questions\n1. Market size\n• Approximately 1% of people over the age of 55 will need open heart surgery in any given year.\n• Heart stents are more effective than other alternatives.\n• All insurance (including medicare/Medicaid) will cover heart stents.\n• Only cardiologists/cardio-surgeons perform the surgery where heart stents would be used.\n• There are two other companies that produce heart stents, but we are the clear market leader with over 50% of the market share today.\n2. Distribution\n• There are three distribution options:\n(1) Use our current proprietary sales force.\n(2) Create a distinct sales force for heart stents.\n(3) Have medical distributors distribute our product.\n• Our current sales force is comprised primarily of pharmaceutical style sales-representatives with little or no medical training.\n• Other heart stent manufacturers use distributors.\n• If we were to build a new, distinct sales force it would be comprised of surgeons who would do a heart surgery alongside a cardiologist and show them how to use the heart stents.\n• It is not a problem to hire qualified sales reps for a new sales force.\nPossible Solution:\n1. Market Sizing\nI started with the U.S. market and then expanded to other developed countries with advanced health care.\nAssumed USA has a population of 300 Million:\n• 100M: 0-25 years\n• 100M: 25-55 years\n• 100M: 55 years+\n100M x 1% = 1M heart stents each year in US\nAssumed 3 x U.S. market size for world market, thus total market size = 4M\nCompared alternatives:\n• Drugs – may be less effective, risky, and costly (risk: patients may not take drugs after leaving hospital)\n• Nothing – high risk\n2. How to distribute\nI weighed both the pros & cons of each of the three distribution options and ultimately recommended a “new sales force” as the most appropriate. However, if there is only a small market (i.e. new market such as Peru, Singapore, where sales figures are not predictable and we have no relationships, distributors may be best method at first).\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Sales Force\nNew Sales Force\nDistributors\n\n\nCost\n\n\nNeed to hire additional reps;\nMix of Fixed/Variable costs;\n“Middle” cost option\n\n\n\n\nMost expensive;\nLarge fixed costs w/ some variable\n\n\n\n\nPurely variable costs;\nMay be most cost-effective for a small market\n\n\n\n\nEffectiveness\n\n\nSkills (not doctors) not appropriate for in-depth consultation and demonstration;\nHave relationships with hospitals\n\n\n\n\nMost effective;\nWill need to build new relationships\n\n\n\n\nHave relationships w/ Dr. & hospitals;\nMay not be able to demonstrate product properly;\nAlso sell competitor products: may not push ours best\n\n\n\n\nOther\n\n\nMay resent higher paid new sales force\n\n\n\n\nWill take time to set up new sales force\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Established in 2000 by a merger of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham, GSK was the world’s sixth largest pharmaceutical company as of 2015,  after Pfizer, Novartis, Merck, Hoffmann-La Roche and Sanofi.\nGSK has a prescription migraine medicine, IMITREX, which belongs to a class of medicines called triptans. IMITREX was the first medicine in this class (introduced to the U.S. market in 1995) and had patent protection in the U.S. until 2015. It remains the market leader despite the emergence of 5 direct competitors in the triptan class. Triptans compete with other nonspecific prescription pain relievers. IMITREX also competes with over the counter (OTC) headache products. The volume of OTC use is at least 10 fold higher than the prescription medicines for migraine. An IMITREX prescription for 10 tablets costs approximately $150 at the retail pharmacy level (1 Tablet per migraine headache), although many patients have health insurance and pay a co-pay of $20 to $30 per prescription. OTC headache medicines cost approximately $5 for a bottle of 30 tablets (2 tablets per headache).\nYour consulting firm has been hired by GSK to assess the revenue potential of IMITREX, as it faces the imminent patent expiration. Specifically, you’re tasked with addressing the following four questions:\n• How would you structure your analysis and determine if this was the right direction for the IMITREX brand?\n• If you were going to switch from prescription to OTC, when do you think it should occur in the lifecycle of the IMITREX product?\n• Would you need any additional information?\n• Would any competitive issues change your decision or affect your analysis?\nAdditional Information: to be provided to candidate after relevant questions \n• Are there any new entrants expected in the prescription migraine market? –No\n• What type of conversion rate is expected in the OTC market? –Unknown\n• Do we have any information of the price elasticity of demand in the migraine market? –No\nMigraine is a primary headache disorder characterized by recurrent headaches that are moderate to severe. Typically, the headaches affects one half of the head, are pulsating in nature, and lasts from two to 72 hours.\nPossible Solution:\nWhile additional information was not readily available to crack this case, it was necessary to recognize that current consumers will be willing to pay $2 to $3 per pill if these pills were OTC. Paying more than this is unlikely.\nIn order for the client company GSK to earn what they currently do they can afford to charge as little as $15/bottle plus some additional costs if they are able to see an increase in sales equal to the increase in market size of 10X.\nConversion from prescription to OTC should be very close to patent expiration, but before full expiration. This is necessary in order to try and convert current customers before the immergence of generics.\nAnother key takeaway is that some customers may take this migraine medicine even if they only have a headache if it is available OTC. Consumers tend to over-medicate themselves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The client has brought us in to find why its European division profit are declining and what to do about it.

I looked into both revenues and costs and was told that costs were already cut to the bones.\nI then focused on the revenue for films as it was the biggest revenue stream, and I would first explore the changes over the years. I have found that the price went down by 25% over 4 years (from 2009 to 2013). The interviewer confirmed that the buyers (hospitals) were exerting pressure on the price.\nThen the interviewer pulled out a table of sales revenue and discount given by salesperson. I pointed out that some salespeople were giving far more discount than other people and this could adversely affect the actual price the company can get.\nThe interviewer then asked me to give a final recommendation at that point. My recommendation was like:\nThe reason for the client’s declining profit is decrease in price of films. Key drivers were buyers’ pressure and problematic sales force practices. The client company should focus on the driver it can control (i.e. the sales force) and change its commission structure to align the sales force interests with the company’s interests.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Currently there is only one bridge crossing the river in New Orleans – Crescent City Connection (CCC), formerly the Greater New Orleans Bridge (GNO).

Currently, corn commodity is sold using a quota system and European markets are protected. The quota system allows a company to sell a certain number of units of corn in a particular European market.\nThe year is 2004. Eastern Europe will be joining the western part of Europe. Eight Central and Eastern European countries (the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia), plus two Mediterranean countries (Malta and Cyprus) are about to join the European Union (EU). Romania and Bulgaria will also join the EU later. Following the enlargement of the European Union, the total volume of corn sold will be the combination of the two markets (Eastern Europe and Western Europe). However, the price of corn in Eastern Europe is less than in the west. What will happen once the two markets join?\nAdditional Information: to be provided to candidate after relevant questions\n• Essentially, a company has the right to sell a certain quota of corn commodity and the market is protected.\n• Note, I didn’t ask for elasticity of demand until later, I asked for everything else upfront.\n\n\n\nEuropean Union (West)\nEastern Europe\n\n\nPrice \n$17.5\n$10\n\n\nQ (max quota)\n2,000,000\n500,000\n\n\nQ (company)\n400,000\n30%\n\n\nProfits\n$3.4 Million \n$150,000\n\n\nElasticity of Demand\n0.5\n1.0\n\n\nQ (max quota) is the total amount sold in the markets before they become a single market, Q (company) is the total units the client company can sell in the market. The client company has 30% of the Eastern Europe market which amounts to 150,000 units. The variable cost per unit is $9 per unit.\nPossible Solution:\nThe client company pays no fee to sell in this market so the company makes profits beyond what would be expected because Q is restricted.\nIn Eastern Europe the price is lower, therefore, once the two markets join, goods will flow from the East to the West where people will pay more until the markets reach equilibrium.\nAfter you draw the graph you can start to speculate as to what will happen when the two markets merge. The price must move up for the East and down for the West. I was asked, “How would you find out what the final price would be?” after I had told the interviewer the direction of the price movements.\nThat’s when I said I would need to know the elasticity of demand in both markets. Using the Elasticity of Demand = %∆Q/%∆P:\n• The Elasticity of Demand in the West = 0.5,\n• If price in the West decreased 10% (from $17.5 to $15.75), then Q would increase 5% (from 2M to 2.1M).\n• If 100,000 units of corn went from East to West, then Q in the East would decrease by 20% (100K/500K).\n• The Elasticity of Demand in the East = 1.0\n• Price in the East would increase by 20% (from $10 to $12).\nThese calculations could be repeated until the price was solved for. Or, we could solve the following equations for the final price.\nLet the final price in the unified market be $X, and the total amount of corn went from East to West be Y.\nFor the West:\n• Elasticity of Demand = 0.5\n• Percentage change of Q: %∆Q = Y/2,000,000\n• Percentage change of price: %∆P = (17.5-X)/17.5\nFor the East:\n• Elasticity of Demand = 1.0\n• Percentage change of Q: %∆Q = Y/500,000\n• Percentage change of price: %∆P = (X-10)/10\nTherefore, we could set up two equations:\n(Y/2,000,000) / {(17.5-X)/17.5} = 0.5\n(Y/500,000) / {(X-10)/10} = 1.0\nSolving for X, Y, we get X = $14.0, Y = 200,000 \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: reduce costs, outsourcing.\nConsulting Firm: Siemens Management Consulting first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: manufacturing.\nCase Interview Question #00795: Your client Kronospan is a manufacturing company that produces and distributes furniture and wood-based panels which are used in many everyday products such as flooring, furniture and timber-framed houses. Kronospan was established in 1897 in Lungötz, Austria, as a family business. In 1970 the company opened a UK manufacturing unit in the former coal mining town of Chirk, North Wales. It is now one of the top 10 manufacturing companies in Wales and employs more than 600 people with 90% of the workforce living within a 10-mile radius of the Chirk site.\nThe client Kronospan has been the local market leader for many years. Recently, however, the CEO of Kronospan is concerned about the growth of the “ready to assemble” furniture market and their loss of market share in the last few years. Your consulting firm has been retained to help address his concern.\nQuestion #1: The CEO of Kronospan wants to understand what could potentially be the main drivers of the loss of market share in the past few years.\nAdditional Information: To be provided if asked\n\nThe client company produces not only “ready to assemble” furniture but also other items made of wood.\nTheir main competitors produce in China.\nThe client sells to other manufacturer factories, distribution chains (retail).\nThe sector is composed by small local players.\n\nPossible Answer:\nSuggested framework: 3C’s, Competitors, Customers, Corporation\na. Competitors\n\nNumber of competitors\nCharacteristics of the competitors (Low cost of Chinese products, margins for retailer, current market dynamics, potential alliances)\n\n–> Strong competition and threat of substitutes\nb. Customer\n\nBehavior of new consumers (need more convenience, less costs)\nSegments and how they differ in terms of needs\nPrice elasticity\n\n–> Reduced cost of Chinese products might be a driver\nQuestion #2: Considering that price is one of the largest drivers of a purchasing decision and that lowering the price may significantly increase sales, The CEO asks you to estimate the costs involved in both options to determine the break-even price to cover costs in each option.\nAdditional Information: Only provide if asked\n\nPrice of Chinese wooden panels in the market: $200\nRetail Margin: 15%\nCost to produce wooden panel in-house: $100\nCost of final wooden panel in-house: $130\nOther costs (logistic, distribution, etc.) = $70\n\nNote: There is no need to explicitly tell the interviewee the values for each parameter. The interviewer may ask the interviewee for an approximate estimation (and use it if reasonable). If the analysis reflected an inconsistent/non-intuitive result, ask the candidate to review the numbers to identify which hypothesis may not be accurate.\nSuggested Solution:\nRetail Price of Chinese wooden panel in the market = $200\nRetail Margin = 15%\nTotal Cost of Chinese wooden panel in the market = $170\nCost of wooden panel produced in-house = $100\nCosts of other raw material = $30\nDistribution costs = $70\nTotal Cost of local product = $130 + $70 = $200\nRetail price of local product = $200/(1-15%) = ~$235\nThe difference of retail price ($200 vs. $235) between the competitors’ and the client company’s offer is a relevant factor in the purchase decision by the consumer.\nQuestion #3: What are the options to reduce costs? What is your advice?\nSuggested Solution:\nThe candidate should brainstorm as many possible ways to reduce costs as possible. If moving the production to China was one of the proposed ways, then different options to implement the cost reduction should be considered with both the pros and cons.\n\n\n\nCost reduction options\nKeep local manufacturing\nSplit production Local/China\nOutsource production to China\n\n\nCost reduction\n×\n√\n√\n\n\nSpeed to market\n√\n=\n×\n\n\nInvestments\n×\n=\n=\n\n\nControl/Risks\n=\n=\n×\n\n\nOverall market advantage\n=\n√\n√\n\n\n\nAn ideal solution is to recommend the client to outsource part of their production to China to reduce costs and continue to produce more premium products locally.\nAn excellent candidate will also asses the implications of the production outsourcing plan: What parts of the value chain can or cannot be offshored (considering price, quality control, brand image, intellectual property, key functions for differentiation, value contribution by function, etc.)?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: market sizing; market entry.\nConsulting Firm: Capital One first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: financial services; automotive, motor vehicles.\nCase Interview Question #00794: General Motors Financial Company, Inc. is a financial services arm of automaker General Motors. The company is a global provider of auto finance, with operations in the United States, Canada, Europe and Latin America. The company is headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas. GM Financial provides retail loan and lease programs through auto dealers for customers across the credit spectrum. They also offer commercial lending products, such as retail floorplan, construction and real estate loans, or insurance for car dealerships.\nFor this case your client is GM Financial. General Motors recently entered the Latin America market and GM Financial started to finance the vehicles to final consumers in Brazil. The CEO of GM Financial Inc. wants to structure a new call center for these new clients in Brazil and hired your consulting team to help.\nQuestion #1: Estimate how many attendants are needed in the call center to served customers in Brazil.\nAdditional Information: Only provide if asked \n\nThe call center handles just inbound calls: it receives call of current customers only. No need to consider prospect clients.\nAs other channels can be used to access the service, assume that only 40% of the customer base in Brazil utilize the call center. Consider also just one call per customer per year.\nThe parent company General Motors has 20% of market share in Brazil.\nOn average, 80% of new cars are financed.\n50% of then use the financial services arm of car manufacturer.\nOn average the financial service is provided for 48 months.\nOn average, a customer buys a new car every 4 years.\nOn average, a phone call lasts for 5 min.\nEach call center attendant works 6 hours a day.\nCall center operates 5 day/week, from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m.\nConsider at least 2 shifts per day.\nAverage household in Brazil = 4 People/family\nAverage # Car/Family = 1\nOn average a family changes their car every 4 years (new vehicles)\n\nSuggested Solution:\n1. Market Size\n\nPopulation of Brazil = 200,000,000\n# of household = 200,000,000/4 = 50,000,000\nAssume that High Income families = 10%; Medium Income families = 50%\n# of household that owns car = 50M * 60% = 30,000,000\nAssume that 60% of them buy new car; 40% buy used car\n# of years on average that a family waits to purchase a new car = 4\nNew cars sold every year = 30M * 60% / 4 = 4,500,000\n\n2. Customer Base\n\nGM’s market share in Brazil = 20%\nGM new cars sold per year = 4,500,000 * 20% = 900,000\nFinanced cars (%) = 80%\nFinanced cars (units) = 900,000 * 80% = 720,000\nCars financed by GM Financial (%) = 50%\nCars financed by GM Financial (units) = 720,000 * 50% = 360,000\nCustomers base (each car is financed for 4 years) = 360,000 * 4 = 1,440,000\nOnly 40% of the customer base makes call = 1,440,000 * 40% = 576,000\n\n3. Call Center Capacity\n\nAverage minutes/call = 5\nHours worked/attendant/day = 6\nDays worked/attendant/week = 5\nCalls/week/attendant = 5 (day/week) * 6 (hour/day) * 60 (min/hour) / 5 (min/call) = 360\nCalls/year/attendant = 360 * 52 = 18,720\n\n4. Attendants needed = 576,000 / 18,720 = ~31\nQuestion #2: Now that GM Financial wants to estimate operations of the call center working 24 hours/day and 7 days/week. How many employees should be hired? (Employees working 7 days a week now)\nSuggested Solution:\nAssuming fixed demand of 576,000 calls per year.\n\nTotal Demand per year (min) = 576,000 * 5 min/call = 2,880,000\nNew days worked/attendant/week = 7\nTotal supply per attendant per year (min) = 52 week * 7 (day/week) * 6 (hour/day) * 60 (min/hour) = 131,040\nAttendants needed = 2,880,000 / 131,040 = ~22\n\nTherefore, assuming fixed demand, the call center can work with only 22 employees. However, this assumes that every call center attendant works 7 days/week with no vacation.\nAn excellent candidate should prove to be able to understand the different processes and constraints in a call center, and how these affect overall productivity, rather than just calculating numbers.\nExcellent Response:\nAssuming there are some peak hours, the candidate can increase the number of attendants to 25 or 26. The candidate must comment about the variation of inbound call distribution: working days vs. weekends/holidays/sleep time, etc.\nThe candidate may propose intermediate solutions (7 days per week, but not 24 hour a day), since late night and early morning hours from 22h to 7h should have almost no inbound calls.\nInbound calls to the call center should include both current customers and potential customers (who call to ask for information but finally don’t become customers). Potential customers are not included in the above calculation.\nAs time/call is assumed to be 5 minutes, no unproductive or administrative time is considered and therefore might be a concern raised by the candidate.\nAfter calling with a customer, some additional work may be required for the call center attendant, such as entering data to the system, etc. This has not been considered in the above calculation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: increase revenues.\nConsulting Firm: PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Advisory first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: software, information technology (IT); mass media & communications.\nCase Interview Question #00848: It’s early 2003 and you are staffed at AOL Inc. (previously known as America Online), a leading Internet service provider (ISP). AOL originally provided dial up internet service to millions of Americans. At the height of its success it purchased the media conglomerate Time Warner. As dial up rapidly lost ground to broadband internet in the early 2000s, AOL’s fortunes significantly retracted and it lost the vast majority of its value.\n2003 has been a dismal year with declining profits for this company and the CEO of AOL has recently announced that 2003 will be reset year and that they are looking forward to 2004 being a rebound year with aggressive revenue growth. The CEO has been getting mixed messages from 3 camps within the organization. One camp thinks AOL should focus only on content and ditch the dial-up service offering. Another thinks they should focus on connectivity alone and a third camp thinks that the best strategy to grow revenues in 2004 is to focus on both. We’ve been asked by the CEO of AOL to recommend some actions. We are at the first team meeting, what issues do you think we should look at to assess the situation and come up with a recommendation?\nAdditional Information: to be provided to candidate after relevant questions\nThe discussion was fairly high level and did not involve any numbers (at least none that were used in calculations). The goal was to develop a high level approach and some ideas for revenue generation for the ISP.\nInformation Given:\n• The client AOL offers connectivity through a dial-up service only, and provides content to its customers.\n• The client AOL has considerable proprietary content.\n• New content takes 6-12 months to create.\n• The competition in the dial-up internet service space has been fierce and has been driving prices down.\n• Our client AOL currently charges on average $20/month for its dial-up service.\n• They currently have 27 million customers.\n• 17 million customers have left this year (2003) alone.\nCustomers can be categorized by age and value drivers:\n• < 20 years – driven by price, looking for cheap internet connectivity • 20-45 years – has wider bandwidth needs • > 45 years – convenience and simplicity\nTwo options are currently being considered:\n• Partner with local DSL/Cable service provider to offer their service with a broadband version of the content.\n• Our client chooses the right connection (DSL/Cable) for its customers and what’s located in their area.\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate: In order to make sure I understand our client AOL’s revenue model, I would like to know what specific products and services it provides.\nInterviewer: OK, our client AOL offers internet connectivity through a dial-up service only, and provides content to its customers.\nCandidate: Do they develop all of their own content or do they partner with other content developers?\nInterviewer: They develop content as well as partner with others to provide content.\nCandidate: OK, now that I have a clearer understanding of what our client does, I’d like to look at the reasons why profits have been declining? First, I’d like to start by understanding our current revenue streams. Has there been significant price decline in the past year?\nInterviewer: Yes, the competition in the dial-up space has been fierce and has been driving prices down. Our client AOL currently charges on average $20/month for its service.\nCandidate: So, it looks that at least part of the profit decline has come from decreased revenues due to pricing pressure. Now, I’d like to look at the customer base and understand the trends there. Has our client AOL been losing a significant number of customers?\nInterviewer: Yes, they currently have 27 million customers, but in 2003 so far, 17 million have left.\nCandidate: I’d like to learn more about the segmentation and value drivers of the client’s customers. Have the customers that they have lost come from a specific segment?\nInterviewer: Well, we can separate customers broadly by age groups:\n\n< 20 years – driven by price, looking for cheap internet connectivity\n20-45 years – has wider bandwidth needs\n>45 years – convenience and simplicity\n\nCandidate: I would guess that our client AOL is losing a lot of customers from the 20-45 age group due to the competition from broadband internet providers. Has our client thought about developing a broadband product offering?\nInterviewer: Yes, we think that our client should focus on the broadband opportunity to see how it can prevent losing customers from this segment. What considerations do you think they need to make to assess this opportunity?\nCandidate: Well, they would need to assess the costs of offering the new broadband service vs. the potential revenue they would be able to generate by stopping current customer churn as well as attracting new customers. They could either develop their own broadband service or focus on content and allow customers to choose their own broadband service.\nInterviewer: What do you think are some of the costs that would be associated with developing a broadband product offering?\nCandidate: I think that the following costs would need to be considered:\n\nTechnology: building/leasing new infrastructure, partnerships\nContent Development: content for broadband\nAdvertising: to attract new customers and retain current customers\nAdditional Overhead: customer service staffing and training costs\n\nInterviewer: OK, let’s talk about how they would provide the broadband internet service. They basically have 2 options: (1) Partner with local DSL/Cable service provider to offer their service with a broadband version of the content; (2) Our client chooses the right connection (DSL/Cable) for its customers and what’s located in their area. Which one do you think they should choose?\nCandidate: They should probably choose the one that will allow them the most control over their costs. I think that would be to have our client choose the internet connection for their customers.\nInterviewer: OK, so, we’re now in 2004 and we are looking for some quick revenue generation ideas. Keep in mind that most content takes 6-12 months to develop internally. Do you have any ideas for other products and services that our client AOL could generate revenues?\nCandidate: Entertainment and Education products such as: On-line music, providing news and traditional TV programming via the web, children’s educational games such as partnering with Leap Frog learning systems for buying or downloading educational games, etc.\nInterviewer: You are in a meeting with the CEO of AOL and he wants to know what we have found so far, what do you say to the CEO?\nCandidate: I think the best route to increasing revenues for 2004 would be to focus on the segment of your customers where the majority of churning is happening, that is the 20-45 age group whose value driver is greater bandwidth. We should look at partnering up with some broadband service and content providers to develop a product offering for this segment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Suggested Framework\nThere are many ways to go about solving this problem, e.g. the 3C’s framework (Costs, Customers, Competition). Key points to bring up in a framework include:\n\nWhat is happening with OVS’s revenue and costs? The interviewer can ask interviewee: “what do you think are the major cost buckets for a firm like OVS?” Examples: Delivery costs, Cost of goods sold (COGS), Selling, general and administrative (SG&A), etc.\nCustomers – Are wants and needs being met?\nCompetition – How is the competition doing? Are there new entrants? Big rivals? Substitutes?\n\n2. Key slide take-aways\nExhibit 1 – OVS revenues have been decreasing for the past 2 years; rate of revenue decrease is increasing; Down 8% from ’96 –’97; Down 13% from ’97 – ’98. The interviewee should begin to think about what the drivers of the revenue decrease\nare and may ask for if a revenue breakout is available.\nExhibit 2 – OVS costs have been decreasing for the past 2 years as well; rate of cost decrease is increasing, but is not keeping pace with the rate of revenue decline; Down 4% from ’96 – ’97; Down 7.5% ’97 – ’98. The interviewee should begin to think about where the cost reductions are coming from and what the drivers are. May ask for a cost breakout for OVS.\nExhibit 3 – Volume of deliveries are dropping over the past few years. What is the driver? Can have the interviewee speculate.\nExhibit 4 – Average price per delivery has remained stable; so revenue per delivery has not dropped.\nExhibit 5 – OVS is the dominant player in market but has been losing market share – 20% over the past 2-years. The interviewee should be able to estimate the competitors’ market size, as well as the percentage of the market OVS currently has.\n\nOVS Revenue: $200M (40% of market)\nVend International Revenue: $130M (26% of market)\nCandy & Pop Revenue: $110M (22% of market)\nOther Revenue: $60M (12% of market)\n\nIt is also important for the interviewee to see that Vend International has grown the fastest at 40%. It will be important to understand how Vend International has grown – what does Vend International do well that has allowed them to be so successful over the past few years?\nExhibit 6 – Should see what attributes are important to customers and how OVS ranks versus their competitors. The top 2 for customers (Price and Delivery Reliability) are where OVS scores the lowest. Conversely, Vend scores the highest in these two categories. Additionally, OVS scores very well in Product Variety and Machine Service/Repair, yet these are not nearly as important to customers. The interviewee should begin to make links between what has allowed Vend to grow (meeting customer needs) while OVS loses market share.\nExhibit 7 – Same as Exhibit 6, just in graphical format; same key information should be obtained.\nExhibit 8 – There are many take-aways form this slide.\nFirst, the interviewee should see that OVS’s COGS, SGA and Repair costs are significantly higher (roughly 100%) than the competition. Additionally, OVS’s costs for delivery are in line with their competitors, despite higher market share – which would correlate to the poor customer satisfaction when it comes to delivery. This may begin to suggest that OVS could reduce costs in COGS (reduce product variety since it isn’t as important to customers; get better prices if buying larger volumes of fewer products), reduce repair costs (again, not as important to customers) and reallocate some of this to delivery to increase customer satisfaction. SGA may also see a slight reduction as complexity in ordering, labor and other line items as fewer products are ordered and repairs are reduced.\nAlso, the interviewee can calculate each firm’s profit margin in order to compare them in a more direct manner.\n\nOVS: (200-200)/200 = 0%\nVend International: (130-117)/130 = 10%\nCandy & Pop: (110-98)/110 = 11%\n\nThis clearly shows that OVS’s profit margin is non-existent and that their competitors are running a more efficient operation.\nExhibit 9 – OVS’s cost per delivery is 9.5% higher than the competition. Also, the breakout of the overall costs within each delivery differs:\n\nOVS’s COGS and SG&A per delivery are higher (roughly 70% of total delivery cost versus 50%)\nOVS’s delivery bucket of the overall cost per delivery is roughly half the cost of the competition – again, not meeting customers’ need and spending less than other vendors.\n\nExhibit 10 – OVS has been reducing costs across the board, but the largest reduction has come from deliveries – which is clearly impacting the overall business. The small decreases in the other large buckets, has not significantly impacted overall costs.\n3. Conclusion\nWhat is the overall issue with OVS’s profitability?\na. OVS’s profit margin is current 0% compared to 10% and 11% for two largest competitors.\nb. OVS is reducing costs, but revenue is dropping faster than costs are\n\nOVS has reduced costs significantly in Delivery, yet this is the most important attribute to customers.\nOVS has not reduced costs much in COGS, yet Price is very important to customers.\n\nc. Not meeting customers’ needs:\n\nPrice and Delivery are the most important but OVS scores lowest in these categories; competitors are meeting customers’ needs and are stealing share away from OVS.\nOVS’s spending on Product Variety and Repair are significantly higher than the industry spends and are in areas that customers do not value as much – need to reallocate and reduce.\n\nPotential course of action to improve profitability:\na. Look to reduce COGS, SG&A and repair costs\n\nA reduction in product variety could decrease COGS through economies of scale – OVS would purchase higher volumes of fewer products, lower cost/unit.\nReduction in variety may also reduce costs of delivery as there would be fewer products to carry in vehicles (more deliveries possible) and may reduce the time/complexity of refilling a machine.\n\nb. Increase spend on delivery to improve customer satisfaction (more research needed!)\n\nMore drivers\nBetter vehicles\nMore efficient delivery routes\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

In order to do it, we need to investigate the followings:\n\nAdditional revenues coming from the implementation of the program (they can come from additional customers, additional spending from a customer each time they visit the store, more visits per year from one customer)\nAdditional costs necessary to implement the program (operational costs regarding the program, additional costs generated by additional meals sold, cost of the movie tickets)\nCompetition and how they would respond to the implementation of the program by our client; It seems like a very easy program to implement, so it might be very easy to copy by competitors.\nConsumers and how they will respond to the new promotion or more important what their needs are because while we are spending energy implementing this program competitors might address other needs of the consumers that might be more likely to determine them to move to competition.\n\n2. Cost–benefit analysis\na. Benefit: additional revenue coming from the implementation of the frequent diner program:\n\n\n\n\n# customers\n# customers enrolling the program\nAdditional revenue\n\n\nFrequent customers\n20,000*40% = 8,000\n8,000*20% = 1,600\n1,600 * 6 times/year * $10 = $96,000\n\n\nOccasional customers\n20,000*60% = 12,000\n12,000*5% = 600\n600 * 3 times/year * $10 = $18,000\n\n\nTotal additional revenue\n\n\n$114,000\n\n\n\nb. Costs: additional costs of the extra meals sold + cost of the movie tickets redeemed\nCosts = (1-30%) * $114,00 + $5 (movie ticket) * 20% (redemption rate) * (1,600 * 36 times/year * $10 + 600 * 12 times/year * $10) / $50\n= $79,800 + $12,960\n= $92,760\nAdditional profits from the frequent diner program = $114,000 – $92,760 = $21,240\nA good candidate will now make a final recommendation.\nI recommend the client should go further with the frequent diner program as it provides the company ~$21,000 additional profits per store per year. However, there are some risks involved that needs to be investigated before the actual implementation like:\n\nImplementation costs (frequent diner cards, staff to help people signing up, purchasing and handling of movie tickets, filling reports, etc.)\nLonger waiting lines due to the additional tasks\nIf profit margins decrease, the frequent diner program may become unprofitable (e.g. 10% profit margin)\n\nWe would need to investigate these aspects before going further with the implementation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: reduce costs.\nConsulting Firm: A. T. Kearney first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: automotive, motor vehicles.\nCase Interview Question #00835: Our client General Motors Company (NYSE: GM) is a multinational automotive company headquartered in Detroit, Michigan, United States, that designs, manufactures, markets and distributes vehicles and vehicle parts. General Motors produces vehicles in 37 countries under ten different brands, including Alpheon, Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, Cadillac, Holden, HSV, Opel, Vauxhall, etc.\nVolkswagen (VW) is a German car manufacturer headquartered in Wolfsburg, Lower Saxony, Germany. Established in 1946, Volkswagen is the top-selling and namesake marque of the Volkswagen Group, and is now the second-largest automaker in the world.\nThe CEO of General Motors attended the Detroit Auto Show recently. He was surprised to see that all the models of Volkswagens seemed to have the same steering wheel. They seemed similar in all respects – shape, size, and materials. General Motors, on the other hand, has many different steering wheels for its many cars. The CEO of GM feels there was merit in reducing the steering wheels on GM cars to one model. He wants you to find out how that can be done. What would you do?\nAdditional Information: to be provided to candidate after relevant questions\n1. Manufacturing process\n• The steering wheel manufacturing process has three distinct stages – Design, Sourcing/Manufacturing, and Assembling.\n• There is virtually no difference in material requirement for each type of steering wheel.\n• The same injection molding manufacturing process is currently used to make the different steering wheels.\n• There is virtually no difference in the engineering design requirements for each steering wheel. Therefore, from engineering perspective, the same steering wheel could be used on all cars.\n• There is no difference in assembly process for the different types of steering wheels.\n2. Customer needs\n• There is no market requirement (customer driven or company promoted) to have different steering wheels on different cars. Steering wheels do not serve as product differentiators.\n3. Cost\n• GM has 10 lines of cars, each with a different type of steering wheel.\n• GM purchases all of the 10 types of steering wheels from the same supplier.\n• Each year 100,000 steering wheels are bought for each line.\n• The steering wheels cost $10 each.\n• The supplier gives a 5% discount for every doubling of an order size.\n• GM also thinks that by consolidating the steering wheels to one type, they can buy all wheels from one vendor. In that case, the vendor will give GM a 20% discount on the steering wheel.\nPossible Solution:\nSince GM’s business is making and selling cars not steering wheels, they were probably looking at this to save costs. So that covered the company’s point of view. However, I wanted to make sure that steering wheel types don’t give GM a competitive advantage or effect consumer demand. That took care of competitors and customer part of the picture. The final piece was financial cost savings. My approach was to verify these thoughts and put together a plan to realize maximum cost savings.\nI recommended that the client GM consolidate the steering wheel types to one type and source the steering wheels from one vendor only. This will help the client realize cost savings of at least 32%. However, before executing this plan the client must make sure that:\n• There are no peculiar engineering requirements that make the steering wheel unfit for a car type.\n• The steering wheel type does not adversely affect sale of cars.\n• The vendor has sufficient capacity to make at least 10MM steering wheels and more as per predicted growth in demand.\nThere may be other areas like headlights and tail lights, moon roofs, and dash board components that could also be consolidated across the different cars types. Our team will be willing to explore those areas of cost savings for the client as well.\nThe interviewer was looking to see how well I could gauge a business I knew nothing about. He said that he knew I didn’t have prior auto industry experience and that was why he gave me this case. He wanted to assess if I could:\n• identify the key issues\n• structure the problem in the context of the overall business\n• make necessary recommendations.\nArriving at the answers was easy. The interviewer also wanted to see how I arrived at my recommendations, and then apply the lessons learnt to other parts of the business.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

(NASDAQ: AAL), a major airline headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, United States. Operating an extensive international and domestic network, American Airlines is the world’s largest airline by fleet size and revenue, and the second largest by number of destinations served, after United Airlines.\nYou are just informed that the price of oil has dropped to nearly $0. Basically, consider the idea that you can acquire oil as easily as you could water. Assume that there are no significant costs in transporting the oil, acquiring it, etc. Who are the first three people you would call within your organization as the CEO? Explain your motivations for contacting each of these people and what you hope to accomplish just having received this information about the price of oil.\nAdditional Information: to be provided to candidate after relevant questions\nWould competitor airlines have access to the same low cost fuel? –Yes.\nPossible Solution:\nThere are many solutions to this case, a good solution will have a solid upfront framework (touching on most of the major issues) and show some creative thinking.\nCandidate: The 3 individuals I would contact are:\n1. CFO – The goal would be to understand how our oil/fuel costs play into larger cost structure per flight. If oil were a significant portion of costs per flight, would there be an opportunity for us to lower costs and allow us to offer more competitive pricing on certain routes. Also, I know we have been taking losses on flights, so would lower costs allow us to increase capacity in order to increase revenues? Is there some difference in fuel costs between direct flights and indirect flights (1-stop or 2-stop)? Perhaps we can now afford to fly more direct flights between long distances because of lower fuel costs and gain an edge against competitors.\n2. Head of Marketing Department – To better understand the current level of consumer demand for the industry and to see if there are any opportunities to add additional flights on existing routes or new routes in order to raise revenues. I would want to better understand the perceived value of direct and indirect flights and if there is opportunity for us to provide lower priced direct flights out of Chicago since that is our hub.\n3. Head of Scheduler/Operations Department – To understand where exactly, in terms of our current flights and destinations, we could add flights and what cities we could better serve. Any operational aspects of our system that is inhibited by fueling costs.\nInterviewer: Okay, let’s focus on your first conversation with the CFO. You mentioned that you would consider lowering your prices with your lower fuel costs. However, your competitors can then lower their prices as well and you could potentially get into a price war, further depleting your revenues. Are you sure about this? What else might you consider?\nCandidate: That’s a good point, since competitors would have access to same low cost fuel and assuming they have a similar cost structure. One possibility would be to differentiate our service. For example, some competitor airlines out of Chicago likely have lower airfares than us for certain destinations, but they have 1 to 2 stops in between. American Airlines, on other hand, offers all direct flights out of Chicago (because the city is our main hub) for a slight premium. Perhaps, we can now lower our prices to compete with indirect flights prices but with the added value of a direct flight. It serves to our advantage that Chicago is our hub and one of the busiest airports in the country because this will give us huge volumes of direct flights.\nAnother possibility would be to consider the Southwest model for American Airlines. Now that oil is cheap, does it become economical for us to operate flights very short distances such as a Chicago to Detroit and offer a more convenient option to driving, other modes of transportation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

As of 22 April 2015, Trader Joe’s had 457 stores, approximately half which are in California, with the heaviest concentration in Southern  California. The company also has locations in 40 other states and Washington, D.C.\nTrader Joe’s is a market leader in organic and fresh food groceries in Southern California. They have been enjoying good profits and great results, though in the last 2 years they have seen a slowdown in the growth of the market share and the profits and same store sales have gone down. As a matter of fact, retail giant Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) has opened two stores exactly two years ago and 3 more in the past two years in the client’s main geography – California.\nOur client Trader Joe’s also started, five years ago, to open smaller stores closer to where there is a high density of people. We have been tasked with helping them overcome their current issues. How would you go about it?\nPossible Solution:\nQuestion #1: Interviewer: What can be the reasons behind their low performance lately?\nPossible Answer:\nElements to be discussed in the brainstorming session:\nMarket share decrease can be coming from several reasons:\n\ndecrease in revenues due to customers spending less in our store and more in other stores,\ncustomers moving from our stores to another stores,\nan increase in the market size that is not captured by our client\n\nProfit decrease can come either from revenue decrease or from cost increase\nDecreased revenues due to:\n\nCompetition: need to assess the entry of new competitors of significant investments from the existing ones that might have stolen the consumers from our stores.\nChange in consumer needs that were not spotted by ous client and have affected the traffic in the store(e.g.: focus on organic products, need for additional services to be provided by the store, etc)\nChange in pricing(specifically increase ) that might have decrease the spending of the consumers or determined them to go to another competitor.\nChange in the assortment of the store that might have determined some loyal customers to look for those products in another place.\nChange in the promotions that the client used to have(e.g. reduction of promotions, elimination of loyalty programs, etc)\n\nIncreased costs due to:\n\nOpening of new smaller stores have a lot bigger costs per unit sold than the old stores\nA reduction in prices that provides lower profitability\nA change in the mix of products sold ( e.g. now the customer is selling more low margin products)\n\nQuestion #2: Interviewer: How can they address the threat of Wal-Mart and the other competitors?\nAdditional Information: to be provided upon request\n\nWal-Mart carries 75% of the grocery items our client Trader Joe’s has at much lower prices.\nStudies have showed that consumers perceive the prices in our client’s store as being higher than both the ones in Wal-Mart and the ones in another close competitor.\nThe reality is that they are 20% higher than the ones in Wal-Mart and equal to the ones in the other competitor.\n\nPossible Answer:\nI do not think the Wal-Mart is a real threat based on the number of stores that they have yet (5 as opposed to ~200 of our client in California). But Wal-Mart can become a real threat once they expand. Then it is very important to differentiate versus Wal-Mart. Our client will not be able to compete on low prices with Wal-Mart but they can perform a market research and identify other needs that customers have and Wal-Mart cannot provide and work on those attributes.\nAs for the other competitors, our client has to work on building its pricing image. There is clearly a problem coming from the fact that they are perceived more expensive than the next competitor. Maybe their prices are not following a good pricing strategy. They should probably conduct a price sensitiveness analysis in order to properly identify the products that should have low prices and the ones that can carry higher margins.\nQuestion #3: Interviewer: As a strategy to overcome their problems they decided to reduce the prices by 15%. Based on the information below how many new stores should they open in the next 2 years to break even?\n\nSales per store: $40M\nStores older than 5 years: 160\nStores opened in the last 5 years: 40\nProfit margin per store: 30%\n\nThe sales/store for the stores opened in the last 5 years is lower than the sales from the older stores. For the simplicity of the calculation we consider the stores equal. (This information should help the candidate assess the validity of the price reduction)\nPossible Answer:\nSales / store after the price decrease = 85% * $40M = $34M\nProfit / store:\n\nBefore price decrease: $40M * 30% = $12M\nAfter the price decrease: $34M * 30% = $10.2M\n\n⇒ Profit loss = $12M – $10.2M = $1.8M\nTotal profit loss = $1.8M * 200 stores = $360M\nNumber of new stores to open in the next 2 years to break even = $360M / $10.2 = ~36\nThis number is not feasible as they only opened 40 stores in the last 5 years and these stores are supposed to have fewer revenues than an average store.\nQuestion #4: Interviewer: They have performed another study to see the customer perception over a series of factors. Based on this information, what do you think they should do?\n\nPossible Answer:\nA good candidate will recognize that the closeness to home is the factor that they can work on as our client is a better performer than its competitors. It looks like on the fresh/organic assortment it has an advantage but a good candidate will recognize that this advantage is easy to be copied by competitors. This should constitute a base for a recommendation for the client.\nExample of Recommendation:\nBased on the findings so far, I think that for our client Trader Joe’s it is critical to start concentrating on the attributes where it has an advantage versus competition and that are also important to consumers (closeness to home) and build its marketing campaign and future communication strategy on those identified strengths. Another current advantage is the fresh/organic assortment. But because it can be easily copied, it will be difficult for the client to differentiate here. The risk is in the short term as building a new brand image is not something that can be achieved very quickly but it will be critical to help them recover the lost market share.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Berkshire has developed specific industry experience in several areas including consumer products and retail, business services, industrial manufacturing, transportation and communications.\nBerkshire Partners recently invested in a train engine manufacturing company named Electro-Motive Diesel Inc. (EMD). EMD designs, manufactures and sells diesel-electric locomotives and diesel power engines in North America. This company has been losing money, but the client Berkshire Partners thinks there is potential to turn it around. They would like to see a turnaround as early as one year. I have to meet with  the private equity firm two days from today. Can you form an agenda for us?\nAdditional Information: to be provided to candidate after relevant questions\n• There are only two locomotive engine manufacturers in North America.\n• Electro-Motive Diesel’s customers are the big North American railroads, there is only one other competitor and they make engines similar to the ones built by EMD. Price is the only differentiator.\n• The cycle from manufacturing train engine to selling takes over one year. Since the sales cycle is over one year, any increase in revenues will not be realized before one year. Only cost savings would be immediately discernible.\n• 60% of the costs are for raw materials used in building a locomotive engine.\nPossible Solution:\nSuggest Framework: Profits = Revenues – Costs\n1. Reduce Costs\nFirst, I focused my attention on raw materials. I looked at the demand forecasting currently employed by this business.\nI then looked at the supplier market. Since there are only two locomotive engine manufacturers, I think that this company EMD may have more bargaining power than the raw material suppliers. The company should be able to negotiate a better deal if this is indeed the case.\nI enquired about the capacity utilizations of the suppliers to make sure that they are well positioned to satisfy increased demand from this company.\nThen I looked into new technology, new engineering designs that may help the company reduce its raw material costs.\nFinally, I looked at the remaining cost buckets for this company – manufacturing, and sales. Though I suspect that the savings here would not be as pronounced as in raw materials, there may be immediate cost savings available from these activities as well.\n2. Increase Revenues\nAfter a discussion of cost savings, I would discuss options to increase revenues of the business:\n• Perhaps we can look at shorter manufacturing time.\n• Perhaps the company EMD can introduce new engine models in existing markets, or new and existing models in new markets.\n• The company EMD could enter the market for engines for different railroad gauges (meter gauge etc.).\n• They could also introduce steam engines, coal engines and electric engines for new markets like Latin America.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The name—Benelux—is formed from joining the first two or three letters of each country’s name. The word Benelux is now used more generally to refer to the geographic, economic and cultural grouping of the three countries.\nOur client is a cardboard manufacturer based in Benelux. It has two plants for which we gathered the following data:\n\n\n\n\nPlant A\nPlant B\n\n\nSales\n$45 MM\n$75 MM\n\n\nCost of Paper\n64%\n63%\n\n\nCost of Other Goods\n6%\n5%\n\n\nLabor Cost\n19%\n13%\n\n\nOther Manufacturing Cost\n6%\n5%\n\n\nDepreciation\n3%\n3%\n\n\nProfit\n2%\n11%\n\n\n\nWhat does this data tell you?\nYou have been hired in by the cardboard manufacturer to improve the performance of Plant A to similar levels as Plant B. What would you suggest?\nAdditional Information: to be provided to candidate after relevant questions\n• The industry is manufacturing of cardboard boxes for packaging.\n• Both plants are in Benelux, owned and operated by a central headquarter division. Each plant has completely delegated authority and is its own profit center. Each plant manages its own sales and its own customers.\n• Both plants have similar manufacturing processes: Print – Cut – Fold – Glue. The last step is optional and is only needed for the premium customers.\n• Both plants have similar equipment.\n• The average salary in each plant is the same – $45,000/person. Assume that everyone gets paid this amount.\n• In Plant A: 15% of the total workforce is in sales; 35% of the workforce is represented by full time employees (management, maintenance); 50% of the workforce is represented by shift operators.\n• Morale in Plant A is very low. If we could improve the morale of Plant A, we could save 10% of the shift costs.\n• All we know about Plant B is that they have 35 sales people.\n• Each plant has different customer mix, but it is not important for this case.\n• Plant A is not very good at forecasting demand and as a result the average production run at Plant A is much less than at Plant B. Changing production runs is a very labor intensive step.\n• We could bring the number of product changes at Plant A in line with Plant B. We could cut Plant A operators by 10% and full time staff by 20%.\nPossible Solution:\nNote to Interviewer: This case has a lot of math. The interviewer should put the candidate under pressure to nail the math quickly. Allow them to approximate, but keep them under pressure.\nFrom the data table, the first observation is that Plant A has much lower profit margin than Plant B: 2% vs. 11%. Also, Plant A has significantly higher labor cost than Plant B: 19% vs. 13%. If we need to improve the performance of Plant A to similar levels as Plant B, we will have to reduce labor cost from 19% to 13%. A 6% cost reduction is around $45M * 6% = $2.7M.\nA. The total labor cost for Plant A is around $45M * 19% = ~$9M. With an average wage of $45,000, then Plant A has about 200 people, of which 15% or 30 people are sales staff. This is very high compared to Plant B.\nIn Plant B the 35 sales people sell approximately $75M and in Plant A the 30 sales people sell approximately $45M. Therefore each sales person in Plant B sells approximately $2M of product. If Plant A’s sales people did the same, we would only need 20 people. We could layoff 10 people for Plant A and save $450,000 in labor.\nB. Plant A has 200*50% = 100 operators and 200*35% = 70 full time employees. By bringing down the number of product changes we could then cut Plant A’s operators by 10% and full time staff by 20%.\nThis would save (200*50%*10%) = 10 shift operators and (200*35%*20%) = 14 full time staff, a total of 24 staff, or around 24*$45,000 = $1.1M.\nC. If we could improve the morale of Plant A, we could save 10% of the shift costs. That is another 10 shift operators or $450,000 saved. So, we have now identified around $450,000 + $1.1M + $450,000 = $2M of savings, which is the majority.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

What opportunities do you see and what advice can you give to the client?\nAdditional Information: to be provided to candidate after relevant questions\n• Value chain: R&D -> Sourcing -> Manufacturing -> Distribution -> Sales (+HR/Finance & IT) \n• Plant A manufactures products selling for $500 Million at $300 Million cost. By transferring production to Plant B they can manufacture the same products for $200 Million. However they would have to incur a shutdown cost of $50 Million and Plant B expansion cost of $200 Million.\nPossible Solution:\nAs soon as I knew this was a Post-Merger Integration case I followed the standard structure of evaluating synergies in value chains and highlighting risks and risk mitigation strategies. I examined three things:\n• Value chains of both companies\n• Synergies in value chain that would provide Cost Savings and Incremental Revenues\n• Cultural Integration issues.\nOpportunities for Cost Savings:\nR&D\n• Patents\n• Combining Research Staff and cutting costs on Labs.\n• Knowledge transfer on existing projects.\nSourcing\n• Supplier consolidation : Higher buying power.\n• Access to new supply sources.\n• Knowledge of supplier previous contracts (transparency) with the other entity.\nManufacturing\n• Economies of scale\n• More optimum capacity utilization ( if current plants were under-utilized)\n• Knowledge exchange on production best practices\nDistribution\n• Access to new distribution channels and new markets\n• Cross-Selling opportunities\n• Higher supplier power\nConsolidating plants\n• We would increase our profitability by $100 Million per year at an additional investment of $250M ($200M + $50M).\nOther issues we will have to consider if we shutdown Plant A.\n• Labor union issues.\n• Any Government Regulations/Labor Laws\n• Cultural integration.\nOther issues: There are also significant pricing advantages that can be gained through this merger.

You are called in by the CEO of Liebherr Group to reduce the cost associated with outsourced Engineering Services.\nQuestion #1: What would be your original hypotheses for the client to reduce the spend of outsourced Engineering Services? Which strategies can the client use to reduce their expense related to outsourced Engineering Services?\nPossible Answer:\nBrief overview: This case is an outsourcing case which requires to candidate to analyze the benefits and costs of outsourcing different business functions.\nSupplier relationship development:\n– Develop selected strategic partnerships/evaluate M&A opportunities\nDemand management/reduce need for external spend:\n– Understand spend drivers for need for external suppliers\nService specification improvement:\n– Reduce number of specific service or skill levels\n– Reduce complexity of services required (e.g., standardize engineering requirements across plants)\n– Substitute skill sets\nIn-source / Outsource (“Make versus Buy” decision) engineering services\n– Total cost analysis\nVolume concentration:\n– Consolidate number of suppliers\n– Pool volumes\nGlobal sourcing:\n– Expand geographic supply base\n– Move more work to lower cost countries (offshore)\nBest price evaluation:\n– Negotiate rates or move more volume to lower-cost suppliers\n– Understand total costs & develop should cost model\nQuestion #2: We found out that the client Liebherr Group purchased Engineering Services from 60+ suppliers, of which 20 suppliers constituted 80% of the spend. We decided to primarily explore leveraging engineering services providers in low-cost countries such as India and Eastern Europe, which we had deemed to be the most promising.\nLet’s explore this offshoring opportunity a bit more in depth. One of the key reasons for moving work offshore is obviously costs – lower wage. What could be other factors driving forces and obstacles – for moving more work offshore?\nPossible Answer:\n1. Obstacles:\n• Legal risks (intellectual property)\n• Political risks (bad PR, political situation of low-cost countries)\n• Learning curve effects\n• Cultural differences, time zone differences and distance\n2. Driving forces:\n• Benefits of off-shoring go beyond cost reduction\n\n\n\nBenefit\nKey Drivers/Examples\n\n\nProductivity improvement\n24×7 availability of resources; “Follow the sun” schedule\n\n\nService quality improvement\n“Hungry” suppliers/partners; intense competition\n\n\nAddtional capacity\nFlexible, large low cost workforce\n\n\nExpanded skills and capabilities\nDeep and large technology expertise\n\n\n\n• Reasons for Offshoring to India\nHistoric Reasons:\n— Primarily wage arbitrage\nNew Reasons:\n— Efficiencies from improved productivity\n— Improved quality levels from offshore service providers (SEI CMM Level 5, COPC, PCMM, ISO9001:2000)\n— Flexible workforce and capacity\n• What additional benefits besides cost savings has your company realized or do you expect to realize as a result of your offshore initiatives?\n\nQuestion #3: After we have established what the key driving forces and obstacles are for moving more work offshore, let’s explore the cost and savings side.\nIn 2014, the client’s facilities purchased 500,000 hours of Engineering Services from third-party suppliers, 10% of which was done offshore. What would be the total savings for moving all the work offshore?\nFollow-up question: are there any other cost factors you would consider?\nAdditional Data: to be provided if probed\n• Onshore supplier rates are on average $40 per hour.\n• The average billing rate of an engineering services supplier in India (assumed to be the best candidate) is $15.\nPossible Answer:\n1. Quantifiable:\n• Additional time needed to (a) before work: package information and write statement of work, (b) during work: communicate, correct, (c) after work: correct and redo work:\n— If supplier proposes Onsite Liaison: 20% today at $40 => 500,000 hours x $40/hour x 20% = $4M\n• Learning curve effects:\n— The candidate should propose 2 learning curve effects:\n(a) For the supplier: Engineering time in low-cost countries supposed to be equal to that in the U.S. after a brief period of adjustment\n(b) For the client organization: additional time needed will come down to 10% => 500,000 hours x $40/hour x 10% = $2M\n• Telecommunications: negligible\n2. Difficult to quantify:\n• Poor quality of work due to new supplier can lead to quality problems during assembly and lead to increased warranty costs\n• How could this be quantified? E.g., warranty costs, number of defects, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: merger & acquisition (M&A); organizational behavior.\nConsulting Firm: A.T. Kearney final round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: software, information technology (IT); manufacturing.\nCase Interview Question #00814: You have been contacted by the client officer responsible for M&S Manufacturing Company to lead a new project. M&S Manufacturing Company has been a solid client since its merger was completed. The client partner calls you after an earlier meeting with M&S’s CIO and CFO. The entire situation at M&S is changing and the client has asked our firm to help. The following information is provided.\nA joint venture, the M&S Manufacturing Company, was established two years ago and is now operating at $4 billion annual revenues with a 25% gross margin and 10% operating margin worldwide based on its ability to generate 15% return on its project investments. Most of the company’s operations and sales are based in North America, however, the company has locations in many countries around the globe. Resources for the joint venture were supplied as follows:\n• Miller, a large manufacturing and distribution company, supplied most of the people, mainframe-based applications and current IT infrastructure, and facilities.\n• Smith, a manufacturing company, supplied cash and patents.\nThe company is now designing a new shared services and IT infrastructure to combine various administrative processes and replace the legacy systems provided by Miller. The scope of the processes to be included in the shared services center includes Finance and Accounting, Procurement, Human Resources, Real Estate and IT which account for 70% of the company’s SG&A expenses.\nShared services allow organizations to consolidate redundant support functions, such as accounts payable, for disparate business units. By leveraging economies of scale from a common IT infrastructure, such a group is able to market specific services to its business units.\nIn bringing together the five processes into the shared service center, M&S believes a specific focus on improving the IT infrastructure should be top priority. The current IT infrastructure can barely handle the current volume of transactions as they are disparate legacy systems mainly built in-house with some of the best programmers at the time. The scope of the IT redesign includes worldwide data communications networks integrating corporate functions with field operations, manufacturing and distribution sites.\nIssues:\nThe company’s CFO has been challenged to find answers to the following questions:\n• How can M&S develop an effective shared service center and a 3-year IT Strategic Plan? How should it be approached?\n• What functions should be included in shared services? Who should run the shared services group?\n• How can M&S align its business and process goals and strategies?\n• How can M&S use shared services to gain a competitive advantage?\n• How should M&S finance and justify the cost of the new shared services and IT infrastructure?\n• What parts of the infrastructure (if any) should be outsourced? How should M&S decide what to outsource and what to retain?\n• What is the right level of IT expenditure for M&S?\n• What SG&A cost reduction trends may have an impact on M&S’s strategies and business performance?\n• What organizational, technological and management strategies should be followed to provide an effective and responsive IT solution for M&S’s rapidly changing needs?\nOur previous shared services work at clients show finance and accounting and HR typically drive 3-4 times the benefits of the other functions. Our initial estimate is to improve operating margin to 12%.\nInternal attempts to resolve these issues have been unsuccessful. As a result, the CFO is looking for outside assistance. The CFO is coming under increased pressure from the business units to address the issues. Some division heads are even talking about coming up with their own solutions if “something isn’t done soon to control cost and improve service levels.” The division heads have formal business plans for the company’s growth but are telling the CFO that the administrative process and IT functions are not well linked to these plans. Additionally, the division heads currently each manage their own support functions within their divisions, while the CFO manages all of the corporate support functions.\nYour Assignment:\nAssume that you have the responsibility to manage the project and provide recommendations to respond to M&S’s needs. A meeting has been set up for you to provide initial insight and general approach for the project. You will have 30 minutes (maximum), including questions and answers. Assume that the ultimate audience for approving your approach includes both IT and non-IT executives. You will need to:\n• Provide an overview to demonstrate your understanding of M&S’s needs and key issues to be resolved.\n• Describe the critical factors to be considered in developing an effective shared service and IT strategy.\n• Provide a project overview describing what your firm will do and what will be delivered.\nSome items to consider:\n• Make reasonable assumptions you feel are appropriate to M&S’s situation.\n“Convenient” assumptions, such as M&S has just completed a benchmark study with ‘XYZ benchmarking company,” will be deemed unacceptable.\n• Do you have enough information to propose a solution? If not, what kind of information will you need to collect?\n• What kind of analyses do you expect to perform?\n• How/when will you interact with your client?\n• What conflicts or difficulties, if any, do you expect? What steps can be taken to prevent or deal with them?\n• What are the benefits of your proposed solution?\n• State any assumptions you used to develop your answer.\nYour recommendations will be evaluated based on organization, approach, rationale and your communication skill, not graphic style. The materials need not cover all of M&S’s issues, but should deal with at least several major areas. You should cover sufficient detail to show your appreciation of consulting challenges and demonstrate your specific skill set.\nPossible Answer:\nBrief overview: This case is an example of a final round case offered by A.T. Kearney which will require the candidate to review material, develop insights and make a presentation.\nFirst, the candidate should provide a “high level overview” to demonstrate their understanding of the issues and desired outcome.\n• A Strategic Plan should be constructed to address the many complex issues involved — not just technology issues but also strategy, organization, management, outsourcing, and investment/operating costs.\nThen, the candidate should provide a “description of the critical factors” to be considered in developing an effective shared service and IT strategy.\n• International — M&S’s new infrastructure has to support the international operations in many countries — with many different host-country languages, currencies, business practices, government regulations.\n• Manufacturing — M&S’s legacy IT infrastructure is a patch network of home-grown solutions rather than an integrated solution to enable manufacturing processes and labor to run more efficiently can currently.\n• Business Plans — M&S’s management has formal strategic business plans for company’s growth; but they have told us that the current infrastructure is not linked as well as it should be with the business plans.\n• Urgency/Prioritization — M&S has expressed a great sense of urgency about moving forward with this project however it is important to show prioritization of tasks and deliverables.\nNext, the candidate should provide a “project overview” touching on key factors.\n• Business Plans — The team will review M&S’s plans for worldwide expansion, new business units, new product lines, acquisitions — all of which would determine the infrastructure needed to support growth.\n• Competitive Advantage — Shared services can increase competitive advantage by being able to speed up processes, add agility to react to market conditions faster, provide a lower cost basis than competitors and increase productivity through consolidation.\n• Financial Outlook — The team will review M&S’s 3 to 5 year financial projections to evaluate how best to finance the new infrastructure along with using past studies to leverage work already done.\n• Executive Information — The team will determine exactly what kinds of information and administrative support the combined company really needs for strategic planning as well as managing day-to-day operations of a modern manufacturing company.\n• Economic Study — The team will conduct an economic feasibility study of the various alternative scenarios for the new shared services center including cost-benefit analyses.\n• Processes — The team will identify roles, processes, and technology before and after the merger for compatibility, redundancy, and costeffectiveness.\n• Legacy Systems — The team will evaluate the legacy IT systems / software, and determine how much longer the existing computer hardware, software, client/servers, networks, and PC workstations will be serviceable.\n• Technology Assessment — The team will take inventory of M&S’s existing IT infrastructure to determine what requirements need to be kept. Given patch-work of networks, packaged systems need to be assessed.\n• Outsourcing/Off-shoring — The team will explore potential M&S’s outsourcing programs with the leading service providers to identify which processes and functions to outsource, and which to retain in a shared service center environment.\n• Sourcing Strategy — The team will assess benefits, costs, and risks for each service area to be outsourced; establish criteria for selection of service providers; define different types of contracts and how to manage them.\n• IT Function — The IT function needs to be integrated with each of its customers. For each business unit, processes need to be translated into IT solutions.\n• Organization Model — The team will help to design a new organizational model based on the new Shared Services structure.\n• Governance Structure — A PMO (Project Management Office) should be set up to help drive the process.\nAlso, the candidate should provide a “Cost/Benefit Analysis” as shown in the calculation table below:\nTable 1. Current SG&A expenses (billions):\n\n\n\n\nCurrent\nFuture\n\n\nRevenue ($B)\n$4.00\n$4.00\n\n\nGross Margin (%)\n25%\n25%\n\n\nGross Profit ($B)\n$1.00\n$1.00\n\n\nOperating margin (%)\n10%\n12%\n\n\nOperating Profit ($B)\n$0.40\n$0.48\n\n\nOperating Expense ($B)\n$0.60\n$0.52\n\n\nShare of shared services centers of total operating expense (%)\n70%\n70%\n\n\nShare of shared services centers operating expense ($B)\n$0.420\n$0.364\n\n\nReduction in expense\n$0.420 – $0.364 = $0.056\n\n\n\nSavings %\n0.056/0.42 = 13.3%\n\n\n\nROI required (%)\n15%\n\n\n\nMax Total investment ($B)\n$0.056/15% = $0.373\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: market entry; math problem.\nConsulting Firm: McKinsey & Company first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: entertainment; mass media.\nCase Interview Question #00816: Bollywood is the nickname for the Hindi language film industry, based in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. Bollywood is one of the largest film producers in India and one of the largest centers of film production in the world. Therefore, the term “Bollywood” is sometimes used as a synecdoche to refer to the whole of Indian cinema.\nOur client, BollyFlix Inc., is an Indian media company providing DVD rentals by mail, as well as movie and TV streaming services, to the Indian market, both under a subscription model. The company serves content made in India for the Indian market (known as “Bollywood” content), and currently has no international operations.\nRecently, driven by the explosive growth of Indian immigrant and Indian American citizen populations in the United States, as well as the increasing popularity of Indian movies among non-Indians around the world, BollyFlix began to consider launching operations in the United States.\nShould the client company BollyFlix enter the U.S. DVD rental market, the online streaming business in the U.S., neither, or both?\nAdditional Information: (to be provided upon request)\n\nThe client BollyFlix provides only movies and television content made in India (Bollywood) for the Indian market.\nMajor U.S. competitors (like Netflix, Blockbuster, etc.) do not serve any Bollywood content. BollyFlix does not serve any non-Bollywood content currently.\nThere are outlets, in both traditional retail and online, that sell such content, but none offering a rental /streaming model in the US at this time.\nBollyFlix operates their DVD and streaming businesses separately.\nBollyFlix’s only goal is to establish a profitable business.\nNote that this is a longer case in terms of time.\n\nPossible Answer:\n1. Market Sizing\nA good candidate will recognize that a proper market sizing is an essential first step to this “market entry” problem. If they do not, steer them toward this exercise with a question like “Who do you think might be the target customers for such a business?”.\nLet the candidate brainstorm as to what inputs they would like.\nGood answers might include (but are not limited to) requests for data on:\n\nSize of the American and Indian American population\nSegments within these populations\nData on non-Indian consumption of Bollywood content\nData on current patterns of non-Bollywood content among target populations\n\nNext, the interviewer should provide them with the data below and ask them what the market for both their DVD subscription service and video streaming subscription service would be.\nAdditional Information: (to be provided upon request)\n\nThe population of the US is about 300M, and about 1% (~3M) claim Indian descent.\n70% of those who claim Indian descent were born outside of the US. 30% were born in the US.\nBased on demographics and market research, we believe that of those born outside the US, 30% would be likely customers. Of those born in the US, 10% are likely customers. These numbers hold for both lines of business.\n0.1% of non-Indian US residents are interested in Bollywood content and are likely to become customers.\nBollyFlix plans to charge $100/year for their DVD rental subscription service, and $50/year for a subscription to their online streaming service.\n\nMarket Sizing Calculations:\nMarket sizing calculations are shown in the table below. Tell the candidate to assume that we capture 100% of likely customers. Suggest to round to 1M customers and $150M in revenue if they do not ask.\nU.S. Population = 300M\nIndian descent population within U.S. = 3M\n\n\n\nSegment\n\nPopulation\nLikely Customers\nTotal\n\n\nIndian descent\nUS born\n900K\n10%\n90K\n\n\n\nForeign born\n2.1M\n30%\n630K\n\n\nNon-Indian population\n\n297M\n0.1%\n297K\n\n\n\nTotal market (population) 90K + 630K + 297K = 1,017,000\nTotal market (DVD) 1,017,000 * $100 = $101.7M\nTotal market (Streaming) 1,017,000 * $50 = $50.85M\nTotal market size $101.7M + $50.85M = $152.55M\n2. Cost Analysis\nHaving established a market size, the next step is to determine what it would cost to operate in the U.S. market.\nAsk the candidate what sorts of costs a company like BollyFlix are likely to encounter.\nGood Answers may include:\n\nContent rights fees (streaming)\nIT infrastructure/bandwidth (streaming)\nShipping & postage\nCosts to establish and operate distribution centers\nPurchase of DVDs\nSG&A\nMarketing\n\nAdditional Information: (to be provided upon request)\n\nFor DVD customers, our variable costs would be: $60/year/customer to purchase DVDs and cover overhead; $20/year/customer to cover shipping costs.\nIt costs $4M/year to lease and operate a Distribution Center in support of the DVD rental business.\nNationwide coverage for DVD distribution would require 6 distribution centers.\nRights to stream Bollywood content in the U.S. would cost the client $20M.\nIT Infrastructure, bandwidth and other overhead within the streaming business would cost $8M.\n\nCost Calculations:\nThe candidate should compute roughly the numbers below. They should conclude that given available information, the DVD rental business is not viable, whereas the online streaming business has very high margin.\nTable 2. Projected Profits\n\n\n\n\nDVD\nStreaming\n\n\nProjected Revenues\n$100M\n$50M\n\n\nCost of DVDs\n$60M\n$0\n\n\nCost of Shipping\n$20M\n$0\n\n\nCost of Distribution Centers\n$24M\n$0\n\n\nContent License Fee\n$0\n$20M\n\n\nIT Infrastructure\n$0\n$8M\n\n\nProjected Profits\n-$4M\n$22M\n\n\n\n3. Regional Analysis\nNext, tell the candidate that we have engaged in a market segmentation study, and come to realize that concentrations of our target population vary considerably by region within the United States. Show them Exhibit 1 and ask for their immediate takeaways.\nExhibit 1. Distribution Center Service Regions\n\nNote: Assume that likely customers include 0.1% of the general population, and 20% of the overall Indian population.\nIf the candidate does not suggest such an analysis on their own, ask them to determine if the DVD business might be viable on a regional basis, if not a national one. To ease calculations, you may remind them that 80% of DVD revenues are immediately eaten up by variable costs (cost of DVDs $60/customer + cost of shipping $20/customer), leaving $20/customer in potential profit, and that the cost to serve a region is $4M (the distribution center cost).\nGiven time, a strong candidate should be able to produce roughly the following calculations.\n\n\n\nRegion\n\nPopulation\nLikely Customers\nTotal Customers\nTotal Revenue\nMarginal Cost\nProfit per Region\n\n\n1\nNon-Indian\n60M\n60K\n276K\n$5.52M\n$4M\n$1.52M\n\n\n\nIndian\n1.08M\n216K\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\nNon-Indian\n70M\n70K\n126K\n$2.52M\n$4M\n-$1.48M\n\n\n\nIndian\n280K\n56K\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nNon-Indian\n70M\n70K\n196K\n$3.92M\n$4M\n-$0.08M\n\n\n\nIndian\n630K\n126K\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nNon-Indian\n40M\n40K\n64K\n$1.28M\n$4M\n-$2.72M\n\n\n\nIndian\n120K\n24K\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\nNon-Indian\n10M\n10K\n16K\n$320K\n$4M\n-$3.68M\n\n\n\nIndian\n30K\n6K\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\nNon-Indian\n50M\n50K\n230K\n$4.6M\n$4M\n$0.6M\n\n\n\nIndian\n900K\n180K\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n\n908K\n$18.16M\n$24M\n-$5.84M\n\n\n\nIf serving only Region 1 and Region 6, total profits = $1.52M + $0.6M = $2.12M\nNote to Interviewer: Revenue here assumes $20 per customer (what is left over after subtracting $80 in per-customer fixed costs). General population numbers are rounded.\nThe candidate should recognize that it is profitable to serve Regions 1 and 6, and very close to profitable to serve Region 3. Ask them what might change in region 3 that could effect this in the future.\nGood Answers could include:\n\nA reshaping of the region so that it better encompasses target populations.\nGrowth in the Indian population, either organically or via immigration.\nGrowth in demand for Bollywood content among either the Indian or non-Indian population (either natural or spurred by increased marketing).\nPricing changes that drive revenue or volume.\nConsumption via DVD could increase (or decrease) overall.\n\n4. Recommendations/Risks\nThe candidate should conclude that the client BollyFlix should enter the streaming business in the United States immediately, and enter the DVD rental business on a regional basis.\nPotential Risks\n\nChanges in demographics or consumer preference could have a large effect on this business.\nThe business may be easily copy-able by competitors.\nSlim DVD margins could disappear overnight.\nHigh margins in the streaming business could attract competition, driving up content prices and pressuring consumer pricing power.\n\nNext Steps\n\nBegin setting up infrastructure to open the content streaming business.\nMove to open warehouses and begin marketing DVD rental business in Regions 1 and 6.\nExamine potential levers to move Region 3 DVD rental business into profitability.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Founded as the Metal Office Furniture Company in 1912, Steelcase currently is one of the largest office furniture manufacturers in the world. It has facilities, offices, and factories in the Americas, the Middle East and Australia.\nSteelcase produces metal parts such as metal bases that are used to manufacture revolving office chairs. Steelcase primarily sells these metal parts to U.S. based office chair manufacturers. The company has enjoyed rapid growth for the past 10 years. Recently, however, they are facing declining revenues. The CEO of Steelcase has asked us to evaluate the problem and suggest corrective measures. What would you do?\nAdditional Information: to be provided upon request\nIf the candidate asks, tell them that there are no specific financial targets.\nGive the three Exhibits below only when the candidate asks for the relevant data.\nExhibit 1 – Steelcase Sales of the past two years (FY 2010 and 2011)\n\nExhibit 2 – Steelcase vs. Competitor cost\na.

Steelcase Costs\n\nExhibit 3 – Manufacturers of Finished Chairs selling in U.S.\n\nPossible Answer:\n1. Insights from Exhibits\nExhibit 1 – Sales Volumes have decreased and so have unit prices (from $500M/50M = $10 to $380M/40M = $9.5). Ask the candidate why he/she thinks the price must have gone down. The most logical answer should be that since this is a close to commodity product, prices for the entire industry have fallen down and Steelcase had to respond. Competitors might have become more cost competitive because their operations are located outside U.S.\nExhibit 2 – Competition has significant cost savings in material and labor. The most logical reasons are that they are based in low wage counties such as China, Indonesia and that they are using an inferior/cheaper metal.\nExhibit 3 – Steelcase customers are moving geographically away which explains the drop in volume despite the drop in price.\n2. Additional Questions to Steer Discussion\nAfter seeing Exhibit 1, the candidate should make an observation that both prices and sales volume are decreasing and both these issues need to be addressed.\n\nWhy did Steelcase have to decrease prices? Because competition has decreased prices.\nWhy did competition decrease prices? Because metal parts are a commodity and they might have a lower cost structure than us.\nWhy do you think our competitor has a lower cost structure? Material and labor could be the two major reasons.\nWhy is our client Steelcase loosing unit sales despite decreasing price? Because their customers are moving to low cost countries.\nCan the client Steelcase reduce costs? Our client is already very efficient and cannot decrease their costs without shifting operations to Asian countries like China, Indonesia etc.\n\n3. Conclusion\nRecommendation – To become cost competitive and gain proximity to customers (chair manufacturers), the client Steelcase has to shift manufacturing to Asia.\nRisk – Downsizing in U.S. will lead to a PR backlash.\nNext Steps – Analyze which country has low cost base, high proximity to customers and low barriers (regulations, etc.) to set up manufacturing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

How would go about this case?\nAdditional Information: to be provided upon request \n\nThe PE firm Baring Vostok wants to see growth of 20% in the first year to justify this purchase.\nThe target company Molds R Us only plays in the Russian market and the PE firm is not interested in expanding across borders.\nThe target company is the only player in plastic moldings.\nMoldings are used where walls meet the ceiling to add a decorative appeal to houses and are only used in residential buildings.\nAll housing starts require moldings in the year they are started, and are all completed by the next year.\nMolding Product Mix (see Exhibit A)\nMarket Size and Competitive Landscape (see Exhibit B and C)\n\nExhibit A: Types of Moldings in the Russian Market\n\n\n\nMolding Options\nNo Moldings\nPVC Plastic Moldings\nRubber Moldings\nWood Moldings\nPlaster Moldings\n\n\nPrice per 10 Meters\n0\n1 Ruble\n1.5 Rubles\n5 Rubles\n15 Rubles\n\n\nInstallation Requirements\nNone\nNeed Contractor\nDIY\nNeed Contractor\nNeed Contractor\n\n\nReplacement\nNone\nEvery 5 years\nEvery 7 Years\nEvery 10 Years\nEvery 25 Years\n\n\n\nOther Important Information:\n\nA contractor can lay down 1000 feet of molding per hour\nA contractor makes, on average, $50 Rubles per hour\nDIY: Do it yourself or self installation\nThe average house in Russia has 4,000 Meters of walls\n\nExhibit B: Moldings Used in the Russian Market\n\nExhibit C: Number of Residences and Housing Starts in Russia\n\n\n\nYear\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n\n\nTotal Residences\n29,689,297\n30,145,394\n30,696,939\n31,375,374\n32,170,804\n33,122,149\n\n\nHousing Starts\n456,097\n551,545\n678,435\n795,430\n951,345\n1,245,890\n\n\n\nPossible Answer:\n1. Market Sizing\nOnce the candidate lays out a framework and asks the relevant questions, the interviewer should give them Exhibits A, B and C.\nAfter the candidate analyzes the two exhibits, ask them to calculate their estimate for the number of meters of plastic moldings being sold in year 2011. This can be done by multiplying the market share of plastic moldings for 2010 by the number of residences in 2011 (2010 residences + 2010 starts) plus the projected housing starts in 2011 (~1.5M). This gives the expected number of houses using plastic moldings in 2011. Given that plastic moldings are replaced every 5 years, the candidate should realize that only 1/5 of existing households will be replacing their moldings in year 2011.\nCalculations:\n\n33.1M Residences + ~1.2M Starts = ~34.3M houses in 2010\n34.3M Residences + ~1.5M Starts = ~35.8M houses in 2011\n34.3M Residences * 25% market share of plastic moldings = 8.6M houses\n8.6M Residences / 5 years (replace moldings) = 1.72M existing houses replacing moldings in 2011\nProjected 1.5M Housing starts in 2011 * 25% market share = 0.38M\n\nSo, 1.72M existing houses + 0.38M starts = 2.1M Houses in 2011 using plastic moldings.\n2.1M * 4,000 meters of wall per house = 8.4 billion meters of plastic moldings being sold in 2011.\n2. Estimating the growth opportunity\nAfter reviewing Exhibits B and C, the candidate should notice the stagnant pace of the market share of plastic moldings. A good candidate will begin to calculate the overall changes in market size to see if there is enough growth to make this deal worthwhile.\nEither way, ask the candidate to calculate the overall market growth rate from 2005 to 2011. This will begin to clue the candidate into the major issue, that the growth rate will not be high enough for the PE firm to move forward with the investment.\n\n\n\nYear\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\nAverage\n\n\nTotal Residences\n29,689,297\n30,145,394\n30,696,939\n31,375,374\n32,170,804\n33,122,149\n34,368,039\n\n\n\nExisting homes growth rate\n\n1.54%\n1.83%\n2.21%\n2.54%\n2.96%\n3.76%\n2.47%\n\n\nHousing Starts\n456,097\n551,545\n678,435\n795,430\n951,345\n1,245,890\n~1.5M\n\n\n\nNew homes growth rate\n\n20.9%\n23.0%\n17.2%\n19.6%\n31.0%\n20.4%\n22.0%\n\n\n\nThe key here is for the candidate to recognize that the market of plastic moldings for existing homes (about 82% of market) far outweighs housing starts (about 18% of market – see calculations earlier: 1.72M vs. 0.38M) and thus recognize that overall market growth will fall well short of required 20%. Actual growth rate < 10%.\nOnce the candidate recognizes low growth rate, ask them for their final recommendation to the PE firm.\n3. Conclusion\nRecommendation\n\nThe PE firm should not purchase Molds R Us for two main reasons:\nPlastic molding market share is stagnant among all moldings sold.\nThe overall growth in housing does not make up for the stagnant growth and they will not grow revenues by 20% in their first year.\n\nNext Steps\n\nThe PE firm should look at rubber molding companies to see if there is an opportunity to purchase an organization because of high growth of market share in the market.\nThey should look at the sales and marketing of Molds R Us to see if there is opportunity to spurn sales to increase growth by investing in marketing, distribution, or sales channels.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The company was founded in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1860 as John Wyeth and Brother. It was later known as American Home Products before being renamed to Wyeth in 2002. Its headquarters moved to Collegeville, Pennsylvania, and Madison, New Jersey.\nThe client Wyeth manufactured over-the-counter (OTC) drugs Robitussin and the analgesic Advil (ibuprofen) as well as prescription drugs Premarin and Effexor. Wyeth recently undertook a benchmarking exercise. They observed that one particular plant in the US had very high per unit costs. This plant produced only one type of cough and cold drug named “Robitussin” in three different types of packaging. This drug “Robitussin” requires a unique manufacturing process. It is an OTC drug.\nThe Wyeth management is trying to figure out what is driving such high unit costs and then what could be done about it.\nAdditional Information: to be provided to candidate after relevant questions \n1. General Information\n• This particular Wyeth plant is located in New Jersey.\n• Wage rates in New Jersey are higher by about 40%.\n• Utilization in the New Jersey plant is about 33% of capacity.\n2. Cost Data for anomalous plant\n• Total cost is at least double of the other plants.\nVariable Cost\n• Variable costs are estimated to be at least 40-50% higher.\n• Cost of direct labor was 40% higher than other plants.\n• Worker productivity was comparable.\n• Other costs (Direct material, administrative, transportation costs, etc.) are comparable.\nFixed Cost\n• The New Jersey plant utilization was 33% against an average of 70%. Cost allocation used total fixed costs proportioned to the produced lot.\nPossible Answer:\nThe basic framework that I laid out initially was:\n• Compare cost structure of the anomaly New Jersey plant and the other plants\n• Process specific questions\n• Capacity utilization\nAfter figuring out that cost overruns were caused by labor and capacity issues the interviewer pushed me for potential cost cutting solutions.\nPossible Cost Cutting Solutions:\n• Manufacture other drugs on the same line\nNot possible since the equipment is set up uniquely for this Robitussin drug and other drugs produced by the company cannot be manufactured at this plant.\n• Sell New Jersey plant, outsource production to competitor\nThe interviewer said that the Wyeth management was not in favor of this since they did not want to lose control of manufacturing.\n• Enter a joint venture with some other pharmaceutical company where they sell the New Jersey plant but tie up close to 40% of the capacity captive to their requirements in the contract. So unit costs are lowered.\nThis last one, the interviewer told me, was what the client company actually did: Wyeth later entered a merger agreement with Pfizer.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Originally founded in 1982 by Ken Hendricks and Diane Hendricks, the Hendricks Holding Company now includes numerous enterprises that span the fields of industry, transportation and logistics, insurance, financial services, real estate and construction, recycling, consumer products, restaurants, and the film industry.\nAs a large, global diversified holding company, currently Hendricks is organized in a matrix fashion, with operating units reporting to both business line heads and country managers. However, the operating units have developed considerable autonomy and often play the country managers off the business line heads. As a result, the Hendricks Holding Company is operating as 200 independent companies.\nDiane Hendricks, current Chairman and owner of Hendricks Holding, wants to reorganize the company into “Natural Business Units” or functional silos. However, she wants to know:\n(1) how she can ensure that synergies across business units are still leveraged (because there are some), and,\n(2) how she can convince her managers to work together to extract synergies.\nAdditional Information: to be provided to candidate after relevant questions \nExhibit 1.

One method to identify them is to evaluate customers of each business unit. If customers are similar (i.e., both the Steel Unit and the Financial Services group make loans to medium size businesses) then there are some likely synergies.\n\nIn order to create buy-in and sell this to the executives the CEO must show the benefits of cooperation to his executives:\n\nPotential savings from common functions\nPotential increased revenue/profits from bundling (for example) products with other business units\n\n2. Define Metrics\nThese may need to be subjective or 360-degree reviews from other business units\n3. Incentives\nPerformance against “synergy metrics” must be included in executives’ compensation in order to give the new structure and synergy promotion teeth.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Dow AgroSciences is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Dow Chemical Company specializing in not only agricultural chemicals such as pesticides, but also seed technologies and biotechnology solutions. The company is based in Indianapolis, Indiana, in the United States.\nScientists at Dow AgroSciences have recently found a way to double the carbohydrates and proteins content in corn using genetic engineering methods. The client believes this new technology has huge commercial value. They have hired your consulting team to determine if the product has value and to whom. Additionally, it is your job to determine how much value it has. How would you go about helping the client set a price for their new corn product?\nAdditional Information: to be provided to candidate after relevant questions \n\nThe client Dow AgroSciences is looking to enter the U.S. market only (which is also its production location).\nR&D costs are sunk.\nNo money has been spent yet on commercializing the product (i.e., manufacturing, selling, etc.).\nThe additional carbohydrates and protein are the only differences between the new and old corn.\nCustomer segments of corn: 10% human consumption, 10% industrial production, and 80% animal feed.\n\nMajor value drivers by customer segment:\n\nHumans: taste and nutritional content\nIndustrial production (extracting starch to produce ethanol products): carbohydrate content\nAnimal feed: nutritional content\n\nThe following information on nutritional requirements was given:\nTable 1. Animal Feed Information\n\n\n\n\nCarbs\nProtein\nPrice/bushel\n\n\n“Old” corn\n50g/bushel\n25g/bushel\n$2.50\n\n\n“New” corn\n100g/bushel\n50g/bushel\n???\n\n\nSoy\n0g/bushel\n50g/bushel\n$3.50\n\n\nDaily Requirement\n1000g/day\n1000g/day\n\n\n\nPossible Solution:\nCandidate: Before structuring my approach, I would like to ask a few questions to understand my client better. Where are we considering producing this product and what is our geographic market?\nInterviewer: Good questions. We are only targeting the U.S. market, which is where we are considering production as well. Consumer preference for corn varies by geographic location, so this is an important point.\nCandidate: Is the only difference between our product and traditional corn the additional carbohydrates and proteins?\nInterviewer: Yes.\nCandidate: Okay, this is how I would like to approach this problem. I would like to segment the market and look at value drivers for each customer segment. Once we determine consumer preferences, we can look at the key drivers of our product to determine which segments they add value to. We can then look at market size, growth, and competitive landscape for the targeted segments to understand our revenue potential. Finally, we need to understand the bottom-line profitability by looking at pricing strategies.\nInterviewer: Sounds reasonable.\nCandidate: I would think that the primary consumers of corn are people and animals. Does this seem accurate and are there any other major consumers?\nInterviewer: There are three categories of consumers of corn: humans (10%), industrial proteins (10%), and animals (80%).\nCandidate: (While my interviewer was talking, I drew a table with the consumer segments by column and possible value drivers by row.) Okay, for each consumer segment, I’d like to evaluate consumer behavior and value drivers for each. Humans probably purchase corn based on taste and nutritional value. Industrial production is based on starch content, so carbohydrates would be the main driver. For animals, I would think that nutritional content is very important to keep the animals healthy.\nInterviewer: That’s correct. However, human consumption of corn depends on vitamin & mineral content versus carbohydrate & protein content. Animal feed, contrarily, requires a certain number of carbohydrates & protein.\nCandidate: Interesting. What this tells me is that our target segments for our new corn product would be industrial production and animal feed. Given that animal feed is 80% of the market, I would like to focus on this segment first.\nInterviewer: Sounds good. Currently, animal feed consists of two main products: corn and soy. Farmers determine mix by choosing the lowest priced combination. We have the following information on current content, pricing, and daily requirements.\n\n\n\n\nCarbs\nProtein\nPrice/bushel\n\n\n“Old” corn\n50g/bushel\n25g/bushel\n$2.50\n\n\n“New” corn\n100g/bushel\n50g/bushel\n???\n\n\nSoy\n0g/bushel\n50g/bushel\n$3.50\n\n\nDaily Requirement\n1000g/day\n1000g/day\n\n\n\nHow would you price the new corn product to push the old corn product out of business?\nCandidate: Let’s consider how much a farmer would pay for an old corn and soy mixture.\nIn order to satisfy the 1000/day carb requirement, you would need 20 bushels of “old” corn to satisfy 1000g/day of the Carbs requirement, which would cost $50/day and also provide 500g/day of protein. Because soy is cheaper per unit of protein ($3.50 for 50g versus $2.50 for 25g), the farmer would purchase 10 bushels of soy to satisfy the remaining 500g/day protein requirement. This would cost $35/day. Therefore, the total cost to the farmer is $50+$35 = $85/day.\nIn order for the farmer to be indifferent between new and old corn, the new corn should cost $50/day. Because the farmer would only purchase 10 bushels to satisfy the carb requirement, the price for the new corn would be $5.00/bushel. However, in order to encourage switching from the old to the new corn products, you would have to provide incentives to the farmers, e.g., charging $4.99/bushel\nInterviewer: Is this the profit-maximizing price?\nCandidate: Let’s think about this. Revenue = Price x Volume.\nDepending on how elastic demand is, we can gain volume by pricing lower. How could we gain volume? Well, we could encourage farmers to purchase our new corn product alone to satisfy the daily animal feed requirements, therefore pushing both the soy and old corn producers out of the market.\nIf we priced at $3.50, farmers would be indifferent between our product and soy in terms of protein value. We would earn sales of $70 (20 bushels x $3.50/bushel to satisfy both requirements using new corn), which is higher than the previous scenario of earning $50/day. Additionally, farmers would be better off because their total cost is now $70/day versus previously $85/day.\nInterviewer: Good job. What else would you consider?\nCandidate: Given that this new technology is easily replicable, we would need to focus on R&D to maintain our head start in the industry. Once other competitors see that we have created a “monopolistic” situation, they will jump on this opportunity to enter this business. Additionally, when we consider pricing strategies, we need to account for switching costs for our customers and factor this into pricing.\nInterviewer: Sounds good. Do you have any questions about our company?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: business turnaround.\nConsulting Firm: Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) first round summer internship interview.\nIndustry Coverage: automotive, motor vehicles.\nCase Interview Question #00832: Our client Chrysler is an automobile manufacturer headquartered in Auburn Hills, Michigan, United States and owned by holding company Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. Chrysler is one of the “Big Three” American automobile manufacturers. It sells vehicles worldwide under its flagship Chrysler brand, as well as the Dodge, Jeep and Ram Trucks.\nIn the 1960s the company expanded into Europe, creating the Chrysler Europe division, formed from the acquisition of several French, British and Spanish companies. Its Europe division is responsible for selling cars to Europe. Recently, the Chrysler Europe division is making a huge loss. In 2015, their total loss was USD $1.1 Billion. They want to learn the reasons for this loss and what they need to do to turnaround the Europe division. What would you do?\nAdditional Information: to be provided to candidate after relevant questions\n• Our client Chrysler’s Europe division sells directly to car dealers.\n• There’s no material change at the cost side.\n• Revenues have declined for the last 3 years from USD $5.5B in 2012 to $4B in 2015.\n• Average price of a Chrysler vehicle sold in Europe has declined from $25K (in 2012) to $20K (in 2015).\n• Quantity sold in Europe has also declined from 220K (in 2012) to 200K (2015).\n• Our client Chrysler’s cars are mostly preferred by a niche segment who likes big and high-end cars. Our niche segment is comparably small but it was profitable.\n• Demand is still strong for our cars in Europe and we have a loyal customer base there.\n• There is no information on competitors or competitor pricing.\nPossible Solution:\nTip: In this case, “one of the Big Three American automobile manufacturers” is the most important statement. As we know, Big 3s have very broad customer base and different automobiles. Starting the case aware of this point prevents you asking irrelevant questions. Rather you can focus on the other important statement, like: “selling cars to Europe”.\nFirst, I talked about a couple of ideas specific to the automobile industry and the nature of demand in Europe in order to find the real problem. The interviewer liked all of them; however none of them were the real problem causing the decline in the price. Then I found the real cause, which was a currency issue.\nCurrency changes. In 2012, 1 Euro was $1.3 on average, and in 2015 it was $1.1 on average. Our average price was USD $25K, or 19.2K Euro in 2012, it is USD $20K or 18.2K Euro now. Approximately 15% decline in the value of dollar makes us worse of while selling in Euro.\nRecommendation\nWe found that our client Chrysler has been making loss because of the currency effect, more specifically dollar’s declining value against Euro. Since our client Chrysler is one of the big 3 auto manufacturers, then it has manufacturing facilities also in Europe. I recommend our client to produce cars in Europe to sell to the European market. Therefore our client doesn’t suffer from the currency effect.\nRisk\nOf course, capacity is an issue here, too. If the client’s European facilities are not enough to handle additional capacity, then our client should decide, based on a cost-benefit analysis, whether the costs of increasing capacity can be compensated by the increasing revenue. Since this is longer term solution, in more short term, our client should try to make agreements with the local dealers to increase the price or to receive the payment in terms of dollars. Since switching costs are higher for the dealers, they may be willing to make an agreement according to their margins. Besides, our client should expand its sales to other segments rather than high-end niche segment. Then there might be serious volume advantage.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

(NYSE: CTL) is large telecommunications service provider headquartered in Monroe, Louisiana, United States. It provides communications and data services to residential, business, governmental and wholesale customers in 36 states. The company operates as a local exchange carrier and Internet service provider in U.S. markets and is the third-largest telecommunications company in the United States in terms of lines served.\nIn the past the telecom industry has enjoyed a monopoly as various regional telecom companies established monopolies under government protection. Recently the U.S. government has passed a new law that allows competitors to enter other regional areas where there is already an incumbent present. The competitor (new entrant) can lease incumbents infrastructure and target incumbent’s customers. The incumbent will have to charge the price set by the government. The client CenturyLink has seen some cannibalization in their regions so they set up a new division to penetrate other regions. However, for the last 2 years that new venture/division has been unprofitable. The CEO wants your judgment before he makes a decision to shut the new division down. What recommendation would you give to the CEO of CenturyLink?\nAdditional Information: to be provided to candidate after relevant questions\n• Number of current customers signed up by the new venture/division: 1 million.\n• The average price per customer per month charged by the new division is $38.60. It is 10% less than the competition.\nCost structure\n• Selling, General & Administrative Expense (SG&A) is $5.10 – half of which is Fixed Cost and other half is Variable Cost.\n• The client believes that they can reduce SG&A by 10% at most without affecting quality of business.\n• Government has set a price of $36.90 that the client has to pay to the competitor per customer per month.\nPossible Solution:\nCandidate: First, I would like to understand the revenue structure of the client. Can you tell me how many customers does the new division have?\nInterviewer: 1 Million.\nCandidate: I think that client has done really well by gaining 1MM new customers in just 2 years in a new territory. Seems like the client has good service offerings.\nInterviewer: The client offers a very good quality service.\nCandidate: What about prices? Is there also a standard price for each customer or is there some price discrimination?\nInterviewer: You are right, there is some price discrimination but I have the average price per customer per month of $38.60. This price is 10% less than the incumbent player.\nCandidate: Why is client charging 10% less than the incumbent?\nInterviewer: What do you think?\nCandidate: I think this is an aggressive pricing policy to penetrate a new region.\nInterviewer: Sounds good.\nCandidate: Let me go to the cost drivers now. Could you tell me the Fixed Cost and Variable Cost drivers? Obviously the government set price will be a big factor.\nInterviewer: SG&A is $5.10 – half of which is Fixed Cost and other half is Variable Cost. Also, the government has set a price of $36.90 that client has to pay to the competitor per customer per month.\nCandidate: OK, it looks like the client is not even making money at an operating level. I.e. ignoring Fixed Cost the client is still losing money per customer. Obviously, the $36.90 that client pays to incumbent cannot be changed because it is set by the government policy. I’d like to look at SG&A and understand whether the client is operating at industry average or not.\nInterviewer: Good point. The client believes that they can reduce SG%A by 10% at most without affecting quality of business.\nCandidate: OK, reduction of 10% on $5.10 of SG&A does not even let the client break even. You mentioned that there is some price discrimination and the price you gave me was an average price. Could you tell me more about customer segments?\nInterviewer: Yes, there are non-business consumers and business consumers.\nCandidate: Probably the price to business customers is higher as compared with non-business, because of peak load pricing and inelastic nature of business consumers.\nInterviewer: Yes, you are right.\nCandidate: Could you tell me what percentage of client customers are business vs. non business?\nInterviewer: 90% non business and 10% business.\nCandidate: So the client is heavily relying on a very price sensitive segment of the market and thus pressured to reduce margins. I would recommend that the client should not close the non-business part of the new division but try to switch from targeting non-business to targeting business consumers and create an opportunity to charge higher prices.\nInterviewer: Very good! This is what BCG actually recommended the client. Thank you.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Exam glove segment:\n• 15-20 competitors\n• Client is market leader with 30% market share\n• Company A has 20% market share\n• Company B has 10% market share\n• 15 smaller players, most of them new entrants, control the rest of the market.\n• Price has been falling somewhat, margins are being squeezed 7-8% growth.\nImportant: growth comes from new customer segments (police department, fire department, etc. who have a need for such gloves given increased fears of HIV and other diseases, new safety standards).\n4. Surgical glove segment:\n• 3 major players\n• Client is market leader with 50% market share\n• Company B has 30% market share (same company B as above)\n• Company C has 20% market share (they do not sell exam gloves)\n• 2% growth\n• stable prices\n• Both company B and C are growing faster than us.\nImportant (do not give this piece of information away unless specifically asked): not all surgeons have the same needs when it comes to gloves. For example, some need thicker gloves (e.g. bone surgeons) than what is currently available, so they use 3-4 pairs of gloves, one in the other.\n5. Client’s Cost Structure:\nVariable costs\n• Raw materials is 60% of variable cost. This is mostly the cost of latex, which is a commodity. The client has maximized any purchasing economies of scale due to its size.\n• Labor is 20% of variable cost.\n• Overhead is 20%.\nFixed costs\n• We have a plant in Malaysia, where we produce the gloves, similarly to competitors.\n6. Manufacturing issues:\n• Surgical gloves are more difficult to produce because they need two molds instead of one, the fingertips need to be bent, sterilization is a bigger issue and thickness is higher.\n7. Sales issues:\n• We sell to all major hospitals in the US and we have reasonably far-reaching operations abroad.\n• We have good relationships with the hospitals we sell to.\n• Hospitals have need for many different accessories, not just gloves: gowns, tablecloths, masks, needles, scissors, etc.\nPossible Solution:\nFirst, state how (by what measure) you will maximize shareholder value and list the factors impacting that measure that you will have to look at.\nImportant (many people miss this): Prioritize which product segment to look at first by calculating the current profit made in the exam glove segment ($4.5 M) and the surgical glove segment ($25 M):\n• Surgical glove segment: 200 M * $0.50 * 50% * 50% = $25M\n• Exam glove segment: 1 B * $0.05 * 30% * 30% = $4.5M\nIdentify the key issues that need to be addressed in each segment (with a greater focus on the surgical glove segment):\n• Surgical glove segment: we are not leveraging our dominant position and good relationships in this market. Growth is lagging behind our competitors.\n• Exam glove segment: our margins are being squeezed and we are not serving the new growth segment that is outside hospitals.\nRecommendations:\nSurgical glove segment:\n• Innovate with existing products. E.g. do a survey of surgeons and assess their needs. Introduce product modifications, e.g. a thicker gloves for bone surgeons.\n• Cross-sell new products (e.g. masks, tablecloths, gowns) with high profit potential by forming alliance with or acquiring manufacturers of these items. Talk about trade-offs of such a diversification strategy (management time, organizational issues, cost-accounting with SKU proliferation).\nExam glove segment:\n• Sell to the new growth segment of police and fire departments through established distribution channels.\n• Consider out-sourcing manufacturing of exam gloves to increase management attention on profit-making business and perhaps even cut manufacturing costs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Originally founded in 1969 to deliver documents between San Francisco and Honolulu, the company expanded its service throughout the world by the late 1970s. Currently they operate in the United States and 60 other countries.\nThe client DHL Express has significant international air freight shipping market share, but a much smaller share in the U.S. domestic market. Recently, some larger domestic competitors, such as FedEx, UPS, Ship USA, and Express Ship, have entered the international market. Our client DHL Express has had only marginal profits. And with the recent new entrants into the international air freight shipping market, they are concerned that they may not be able to break even this year. What should they do?\nAdditional Information: to be provided to candidate after relevant questions\nAfter the interviewee develops a clear framework and asks appropriate questions, provide them with the following Exhibits.\nExhibit 1. Client’s Market Share in domestic and international market\n\nExhibit 2. Client’s Cost Structure vs. Competitors\n\nOther additional information:\n• Our client DHL Express recently reduced their retail prices to compete with lower prices competitor Ship USA. However, this move did not increase their market share significantly.\n• Retail prices provided in the cost structure slide are typical of U.S. rates.\n• Competitor Express Ship has lower delivery costs because it has significant market share in the U.S. ground business, which our client DHL does not compete in.\n• International growth is expected over the next 10 years.\n• The client DHL has optimized variable costs. There are no major cost savings (direct the interviewee away from this area if they mention it).\nPossible Solution:\nGross Profit calculations:\n\nOur client DHL: $1.20 – $0.80 – $0.30 – $0.10 = 0\nShip USA: $1.30 – $0.60 – $0.40 – $0.10 = $0.20\nExpress Ship: $1.15 – $0.70 – $0.20 – $0.10 = $0.15\n\nIt is important to recognize that our client DHL will not be profitable in the express air business because it does not have domestic scale (only 15% share), which is still key for the shipping business. Even with growth in the international business they will have significant difficulty competing, especially as new entrants come in.\nRecommendation:\nAttempt a merger or partnership with Express Ship. Our client could provide international shipping service and Express Ship could provide domestic services. The interviewee should address the risks associated with this merger plan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: improve profitability.\nConsulting Firm: Ernst & Young first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: entertainment; mass media.\nCase Interview Question #00826: Our client Sony Music Entertainment Inc. (sometimes also known as Sony Music or SME) is an American music corporation managed and operated by Sony Corporation of America (SCA), a subsidiary of Japanese conglomerate Sony Corporation. Headquartered in New York City, Sony Music is one of the largest music companies in the U.S.\nAs a large national retailer of music, the client Sony Music has historically been very profitable. However, with the rise of online music streaming, the music CDs retailing segment of their business has seen declining profits over the last couple of years. Your consulting team has been hired in by the CEO of Sony Music to help deal with this problem. How would you go about analyzing this case?\nAdditional Information: to be provided to candidate after relevant questions\n• The client Sony Music’s annual profits used to be $80M, now it’s running minimal profit.\n• Suppliers supply directly to us. There are no logistics costs. \n• There are 4 other big players in the market: Universal Music Group, Warner Music Group, EMI Group, Bertelsmann Music Group. Competitors are of similar size to us, we do not know if they are making money. 2 are similar large retailers and 2 are specialized music suppliers.\n• The market size for music CDs has been shrinking over the last couple of years.\n• The client Sony Music holds both new releases and catalog CDs.\n• The price of a New CD is 12$ and the price of a catalog CD is 15$. The cost to us of either type of CD is 10$.\nIncome Statement:\n• Revenues from New CDs $704M\n• Revenues from Catalogs $444M\n• Total COGS $900M\n• Store rental overhead $150M\n• Labor expense $90M\n• Profit: $8M\nNote to Interviewer: Allow the candidate to approximate in their calculations, but keep him/her under pressure.\nPossible Solution:\nCandidate: Having established that the music CDs market is shrinking and we have already seen consolidation to a few big players, it is going to be hard to capture any additional market share through acquisitions or marketing ploys.\nI assume that the cost we pay for a CD is similar to other players, and that we hold minimal inventory?\nInterviewer: Correct.\nCandidate: I would like to look at the profitability of each part of this business. Do we have any data on how the overhead costs are allocated?\nInterviewer: What do you think?\nCandidate: I expect that the costs will be allocated by square foot space occupied. Can you tell me how much space we have dedicated to New CDs and Catalog CDs?\nInterviewer: 90% of our space is catalog CDs and 10% is used for new CDs.\nCandidate: Interesting, in which case we can actually allocated those costs better and carry out an ABC analysis on each part of the business. I will assume that the labor costs are similar to each and can be divided by the number of CDs we sell.\nNote: ABC analysis (or Selective Inventory Control) is an inventory categorization technique. ABC analysis divides an inventory into three categories- “A items” with very tight control and accurate records, “B items” with less tightly controlled and good records, and “C items” with the simplest controls possible and minimal records.\nThe ABC analysis provides a mechanism for identifying items that will have a significant impact on overall inventory cost, while also providing a mechanism for identifying different categories of stock that will require different management and controls.\nInterviewer: Sounds a good assumption.\nCandidate: We have $704M revenues of new releases. At a unit price of $12, this means we sell around $704M/$12 = ~60M new CDs and around $444M/$15 = ~30M catalog CDs. Hence:\n\n\n\n\nNew CDs\nCatalog CDs\n\n\nRevenues\n$704M\n$444M\n\n\nVolume\n~60M\n~30M\n\n\nCOGS\n$600M\n$300M\n\n\nSpace overhead\n$15M\n$135M\n\n\nLabour\n$60M\n$30M\n\n\nProfit\n704-600-15-60 = $29M\n444-300-135-30 = -$21M\n\n\n\nSo the New CD business is profitable for us, but the Catalog CD business is unprofitable.\nInterviewer: OK, what are your recommendations to the client?\nCandidate: The reason we are not making large profits in this segment of your business is that the Catalog CD part of the business is loosing money. The New CD business is still profitable and over the coming weeks my team is going to look at the following issues:\n\nwhether we can optimize the space used for catalog CDs,\nwhether we would lose any cross selling opportunities if we reduced/removed the catalog CDs,\nwhat product we can best place in the space previously occupied by catalog CDs.\n\nInterviewer: Very good. Thank you! \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: growth.\nConsulting Firm: A.T. Kearney first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: restaurant & food service; small business, startups.\nCase Interview Question #00827: Our client had an antique store in downtown Chicago that could not meet the sales targets. Therefore, in order to attract customers, the owners of the antique store (a young couple in their early 30′s) have started to make home made sandwiches and begin selling sandwiches in their antique store.\nAfter a while the home made sandwiches have become more and more popular around the area, so they have increased their profits and they kept going. Currently, they want to expand their business by opening new stores, but they do not know whether it is a good strategy. They want you to develop their strategy to grow regarding the cost and the business drivers. What are your thoughts?\nAdditional Information: to be provided to candidate after relevant questions\n• The Chicago antique store mostly serves sandwiches during the lunch time. 75% of the revenue is generated by lunch with the rest after 1 pm.\n• The antique store is fully utilized during lunch and under utilized at other times.\n• Sandwiches are 50% of the revenues, desserts 10%, chips 10% and drinks 30%.\n• Variable costs: raw materials, labor and processing.\n• Fixed costs: rent, SG&A, insurance and depreciation.\nPossible Solution:\nAlthough it was a first round case, it was given by an A.T. Kearney partner. He barely gave any data, therefore I made assumptions most of the time to proceed. He continuously asked for creative and reasonable ideas. Since the partner did not speak at all, I put down my structure and followed it. Therefore, this case interview was not a dialogue. During the case, it was hard to understand whether he liked my structure and ideas, but he gave very good feedback at the end. The key in such cases is to keep confidence, stick to your structure and proceed with reasonable assumptions. And a creative recommendation would be a great final.\nFirst, I put some effort to understand the competition and the customers’ value drivers that would give me a direction to focus about the direction and the mode of the growth that I could recommend for my client. Here are some of my findings and assumptions:\n• Competitors are the restaurants around serving mostly from 11:30am – 1:30pm.\n• Rents are high in downtown Chicago and the new stores need to breaking even soon to enable further growth opportunities.\n• Most customers are working people who want a quick lunch and some non-working people and the students.\n• Currently there is no delivery service, this can be another option to generate additional revenue.\n• They need to keep the reputation of serving home made delicious sandwiches in an antique decorated atmosphere.\nAfter that, I focused on the direction and the mode of the growth applicable for my client. Starting with the option of opening new stores, I have listed the alternatives and evaluated each one briefly.\nMode of growth:\n• With internal resources\n• Alliances\n• Merger & acquisition (M&A)\nDirection of growth:\n• Internal business\n• Vertical integrations\n• Diversification (related and unrelated businesses)\n• New geographic areas\nThere is no right answer and no conclusion to be reached in this case. You need to be comprehensive enough while finding out the best growth strategy for the client regarding the prioritization because it is not possible to cover everything in detail in just 25 minutes.\nI found out that our client can open new stores in very limited numbers in Chicago because of the difficulty of finding available store locations in downtown Chicago and the high rents.\nHowever, our client might try to expand by not keeping the original format (not antique decorated big store) in Chicago. Also they can make the sandwiches for the groceries and other fast food stores. Delivery might increase their customer base and also they might keep the store utilized after rush hours.\nBy keeping the format, they can open new stores in strategic locations of other big cities like NYC or Los Angeles. One but very profitable store in each big city might be good enough for our client (I could not make a break-even calculation because I did not have any data). Products might be expanded according to the location and the customer base. Why only sandwiches?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: growth; merger & acquisition (M&A).\nConsulting Firm: McKinsey & Company 1st round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: apparel, clothing & textiles; retail.\nCase Interview Question #00805: Our client is Saks Fifth Avenue, an American chain of luxury fashion stores for women’s apparel. Its flagship store and corporate headquarters are located on Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. Competitors in the U.S. have historically included Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus, and Bloomingdale’s.\nWith a 50% market share in its segment, Saks Fifth Avenue has had strong growth in revenues and profits over the last few years via geographical expansion and opening of new stores. The management believes that through their current strategy, Saks Fifth Avenue has reached critical mass of the rich people who fall in their target customer segment. The CEO, Mr. Saks, has retained McKinsey to help formulate strategies for future growth. How can Saks Fifth Avenue grow?\nPossible Answer:\nIn most McKinsey style interviewer-led cases, the interviewer directly starts asking questions after reading the background. Let the candidate ask for time to note down the important facts from the background, if he or she feels the need to do so.\nQuestion #1: What are the key avenues for growth for Saks Fifth Avenue? \nPossible Answer:\nAn excellent response will include a candidate taking a minute to draw up a structure and frame the question with the three following alternatives for growth:\n\nOrganic growth\nGrowth via acquisition\nPartnerships and strategic alliances\n\nA candidate might start by suggesting growth by acquiring new customers segments, new markets, new channels or new products. These are all great thoughts, but can fit under each of the above mentioned avenues for growth – organic, acquisitions or partnerships.\nIf the candidate mentions other ideas, try to steer him or her towards thinking about growth strategies at a macro level – organic, acquisitions or partnerships.\nQuestion #2: After reviewing the three paths for growth, the management of Saks Fifth Avenue ruled out the partnerships and strategic alliances with other players. However, they liked the idea of acquisitions and organic growth. What about Saks Fifth Avenue’s business would suggest that acquiring other players might be a good strategy for them?\nPossible Answer:\nAn excellent response will include:\n\nSurplus Cash\nStrong financials and balance sheet\nPotential Synergies in Revenue Expansion and/or Cost Optimization\nTrack record of successful integration post acquisition\n\nQuestion #3: What are the different types of synergies possible in this business?\nPossible Answer:\nA few possibilities are:\n\nGaining new customers\nNew lines of products\nNew channels\nComplementary strategic locations in retail outlets\nReduction in overheads and G&A expenses\nIncreased buyer power to source products\nTax deductions due to possible debt\n\nQuestion #4: After some due diligence, the McKinsey case team identified “Lord & Taylor” as an acquisition target. Lord & Taylor has 20% market share and a huge potential to grow. There was an 80% customer overlap between Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor. What is the growth percentage in the number of customers that Saks Fifth Avenue can expect from this acquisition?\nPossible Answer:\nThis is a quantitative question designed to test the numerical ability of the candidate, and the candidate is expected to ask for relevant information and make reasonable assumptions. The candidate should come up with analysis similar to the following:\n\nLet us assume that the total number of customers in our target segment is 100.\nLet us also assume that the spending per customer is similar in both Lord & Taylor and Saks Fifth Avenue (and across the industry) so that our market share in terms of $s also translates into market share in terms of the number of customers.\nThus, Saks Fifth Avenue has 50% market share, or 50 customers; Lord & Taylor has 20% market share, or 20 customers.\n\nBecause there is an 80% customer overlap between Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor, after the acquisition Saks Fifth Avenue would get 20 * (1-80%) = 4 additional customers; which would mean an increase of 4/50 = 8% in the customer base.\nThis, of course, assumes that all 20% of Lord & Taylor customers who do not shop at Saks Fifth Avenue will become Saks Fifth Avenue’s customers. That seems like an aggressive assumption.\nQuestion #5: Are there any risks in this strategy or in the acquisition of Lord & Taylor that you would like the CEO to be aware of?\nPossible Answer:\nThis is an open-ended question designed to test the candidate’s critical thinking. A few risks could be:\n\nCustomer retention: In this analysis, we have assumed that Saks Fifth Avenue would attract 100% of Lord & Taylor’s customers. This might not happen, so one could suggest building a few scenarios to test the result under different situations.\nMismatch of organizational culture between Lord & Taylor and Saks Fifth Avenue. In a business targeting the premium high-end consumer, customer service is a key element and this can be negatively impacted if the employees of the combined firm do not work well together.\n\nQuestion #6: Your team presents the CEO, Mr. Saks, with the proposal to acquire Lord & Taylor and its associated benefits and risks. The CEO, in consultation with the board, agrees that this is a feasible solution and will look into implementing it. At the end of the meeting, Mr. Saks says, “I like the work you’ve done here, but it is not enough to meet our growth targets. What other ideas could we consider?”\nPossible Answer:\nThis last question is to test the attentiveness of the candidate and his or her creative thinking.\nThe candidate should remember that the CEO had also liked the idea of organic growth, as was suggested in the beginning of the case. Thus, this could be a great starting point to talk about how the company could grow organically to supplement growth from acquisitions. Brainstorm and discuss on various ideas for this with the candidate.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The company was known as Corning Glass Works until 1989, when it changed its name to Corning Inc. The company is headquartered in Corning, New York.\nThis case is about Corning’s mirroring business unit. Corning Inc. has 3 divisions within its mirroring business unit: Large Surface, Custom Cut and Mirroring. Large Surface produces large surfaces of simple flat glass. Custom Cut cuts the large surfaces in smaller forms. Part of the glass produced by Large Surface or Custom Cut goes to external customers; part of it goes to the other business division(s). The Mirroring Division makes custom made mirrors for furniture producers. Mirroring gets the specific glass shapes from Custom Cut, adds the mirror surface through a chemical treatment and finishes them.\n3 years ago Corning’s Mirroring division was break-even and last year (2015) the division made a loss of $6 million. What is happening and how could we solve this?\nPossible Answer:\nNote to the Interviewer or Case Giver: This is a profitability case, and we are looking for the 3 major reasons why the Mirroring division profitability has declined. This case is meant to be very interactive and you need to ask the candidate very often what he or she thinks is happening. We also want the candidate to come up with these 3 reasons and let him/her elaborate on them. In the initial structure the candidate should touch upon these.\n1. Revenues, Costs, and Profits\nThe candidate should ask for this additional data. Do not give unless asked.\n1.a. The cost components\n\nWe assume that there are only 2 major costs: labor and cut glass, and both were 50% of total cost in 2012.\nThere was a lot of capacity addition in the cut glass industry and cut glass prices dropped by 30% from 2012 to 2015.\nThe client has also been investing in technology and through higher efficiency labor costs have decreased by 20% from 2012 to 2015.\n\n1.b. The sales & revenue data\n\nSales were $60 million in 2012 and $39 million in 2015.\nThe company’s Mirroring division broke-even in 2012 and made a loss of $6 million in 2015.\nIn volume terms sales were stagnant at 3 million square feet over this period (from 2012 to 2015).\n\nIf the interviewer provides the candidate with the profit, sales and selling price, the candidate should be able to come up with the price and the cost per unit. If he or she does not, ask him/her to calculate it.\nThe candidate should come up with a calculation table like the following one:\n\n\n\n\n2012\n2015\nChange\n\n\nSales ($ million)\n60\n39\n-35%\n\n\nSales (million square feet)\n3\n3\n0%\n\n\nProfit ($ million)\n0\n-6\nN.A.\n\n\nPrice ($ / square feet)\n20\n13\n-35%\n\n\nTotal Cost ($ / square feet)\n20\n15\n-25%\n\n\nLabor ($ / square feet)\n10\n8\n-20%\n\n\nCut Glass ($ / square feet)\n10\n7\n-30%\n\n\n\nConclusion: From this calculation table we can conclude that prices have fallen by 35% while costs have decreased only by 25% and this is the reason for the losses. We can also conclude that the drop in the cost of glass explains a drop in price of $3/sq ft and the drop in labor costs explains another $2/sq ft. The break-even price should be $15/sq ft. We, therefore, need to analyze why the price dropped more than costs.\n2. Competitive Landscape\nImportant: let the candidate ask the right questions.\n2.a. Market structure and market share\n\nOur client Corning is operating in a market where there are at least 15 competitors.\nThere are 3 big players in the market with each about 20% of the market, the rest are all small shops.\nOur client Corning is one of the big players.\n\n2.b. Competitors detail\nOne of our big competitors is located in just across the border in Mexico.\n\nCost advantage in labor: The labor costs in Mexico are 40% cheaper.\nWith this information, the candidate should do the following calculation and conclude: This is a big deal: labor costs are about $8 /sq foot for us, so this means our competitor can produce the glass at 7 + 8*(1-40%) = $11.8/sq foot.\n\nThe candidate should try to determine if there are any other costs incurred: For being in Mexico they incur extra shipping costs of about $1.20/sq foot.\nConclusion: One of our main competitors has a labor cost advantage of 40% and can produce and transport the glass at $13/sq ft. This might explain another $2/sq ft in price decrease to $13/sq ft. But margins, even for our competitor, are extremely thin – we need to evaluate who our customers are and what their bargaining power is.\n3. Customers\nAlso in this area the candidate should try to find out what is going on, let him/her ask the questions.\n\nIn 2012 we sold 80% of our products to 5 clients.\nBecause of a crisis in the furniture industry, there have been 2 mergers, so that we now supply 80% of our sales to 3 clients.\nThese 3 clients make up about 75% of the industry sales.\n\nConclusion: The bargaining power of our customers has gone up significantly and they squeeze our margins and those of the competitors. We should evaluate if there are other customer segments that we can sell to without significant investments.\n4. Wrap Up\nAsk the candidate to summarize the factors that influence the price decrease between 2012 and 2015.\nSample Summary:\n\nOur client’s price has dropped by 35% which can be explained in part by the fact that costs have gone down by 25%.\nA competitor is located in Mexico and has a significant labor cost advantage and is able to price lower than us.\nThe increased bargaining power of customers, as a result of consolidation in the industry, drives margins down close to 0.\n\nPossible options to be analyzed:\n\nFurther improvement in efficiency.\nMoving manufacturing to a proximate low cost location like Mexico.\nLobbying government for support (subsidies, etc) to prevent job losses to Mexico.\nDiversifying the customer base\nConsolidation\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

CTA is the operator of mass transit within the City of Chicago, Illinois and some of its surrounding suburbs, including the trains of the Chicago ‘L’ and CTA bus service. The CTA is an Illinois independent governmental agency that started operations on October 1, 1947 upon the purchase and combination of the transportation assets of the Chicago Rapid Transit Company and the Chicago Surface Lines streetcar system. Today, the CTA is one of the three service boards financially supported by the Regional Transportation Authority.\nThe CTA has just received $300MM funding from the Regional Transportation Authority and want us to identify which of the 20 different technology projects should be implemented and in which order. Currently, they have a 30 year old IBM Mainframe system. They have written bridge and translation code to interface with some of their newer IT systems. However, everything is controlled by this old IBM mainframe. How would you advise them?\nAdditional Information: to be provided to candidate after relevant questions\n• CTA is a public service operator. They may take on negative net present value (NPV) projects if it serves the public. They may also prioritize based on public, not financial, needs.\n• CTA does not want to fire any of its employees.\n• Almost all CTA technology employees know only old mainframe systems.\n• No one knows the original code for the mainframe system. Bug fixes are being done by people who only know bits and pieces of the system.\n• CTA has enough money to do all 20 technology projects.\n• The IBM mainframe system in use is from 1970s and there are not many people who can support it. However, almost all systems are controlled by this mainframe system.\n• There are two high profile projects – Enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, and Smartcard for toll booths.\nPossible Solution:\nFirst, I analyzed the mainframe core. I would first assess the impact of each project on three areas of CTA’s technology infrastructure:\n• Impact on the core mainframe system.\n• Impact on the translation/bridge software.\n• Impact/requirement for new IT system.\nI would then assess the person hours needed to implement the project. I would then organize the projects using the following criteria:\n• How critical is the project to public needs?\n• Does the project impact critical systems of existing infrastructure?\n• Economic impact of project – measured in dollars and person hours.\n• Personnel training required for new system.\nI looked briefly into the two high profile projects, using the criteria above. I guessed that the Smartcard project is more critical and I would choose that over an ERP implementation.\nThis case was really about keeping the business goals of the client in mind. The most important issue was to realize that the client CTA’s goal is NOT to cut costs but to provide service. I was later told that CTA had enough money to do all the 20 projects. They were required to implement some money losing projects as well because as a public service operator they were legally obligated to implement them.\nThe interviewer also wanted to see what criteria I would use to prioritize different projects. He wanted to see if I could logically structure my approach, and assess the impact of my recommendations on the technology infrastructure and business goals of the client.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: investment; estimate.\nConsulting Firm: McKinsey & Company first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: non-profit organization; government, public sector.\nCase Interview Question #00806: You and your team have taken on a not-for-profit engagement with the Metropolis Art Institute (MAI). The MAI’s curator, Joe, has asked for your help to assist him in approaching the Metropolis government for additional funding of USD $5 Million in order to develop new programs.\nThe MAI was founded eight years ago with much of the funding coming from the Metropolis city government. Since the doors opened, the MAI has established itself as one of the Top 10 institutions of fine art in the world and has become a very popular tourist destination, drawing many visitors to Metropolis. Despite MAI’s success, Metropolis, like many other municipal governments, has limited funds and is only willing to offer additional money to MAI if it can show that it has already tangibly enhanced the city of Metropolis. In a meeting with Joe, the mayor said, “The city council will only give the MAI more money if we can see in concrete terms that the money we gave to build the MAI was money well spent.” This is what Joe would like your help with. Bear in mind the mayor and all the city council have MBAs with concentrations in economics so they will be able to detect erroneous arguments. How would you go about this case?\nPossible Answer:\nThis is a typical McKinsey-style interviewer-led case where a scene is set after which a broad question is asked which the interviewee must answer. As the interview progresses, more specific questions will be asked.\nQuestion #1: First of all, what areas might you look at to show the value the MAI has brought to the city of Metropolis?\nPossible Answer:\nThere are many answers to this broad question. The best answers will organize the benefits in some logical manner. One should also list derivative benefits (benefits which result from a direct benefit). A few examples might be:\na. Economic benefits\n\nMoney made directly by the museum via admission prices, restaurant, and gift shop.\nMoney brought into the economy by tourists to ancillary businesses like restaurants, motels, car-rental agencies, etc.\nEnhanced tax revenues due to an enhanced economy resulting from having a more-intelligent citizenry and city with a higher quality of life.\nLower costs on support services like police since due to lower crime rates which result from enhanced local economy.\nThe development of secondary industries needed to support the museum like art appraisers and restorers, security agencies, and frame makers.\n\nb. Non-economic benefits\n\nA happier citizenry due to the pride derived from having a world-class museum in their city.\nA happier citizenry because now there are more options of things in the city to do.\nA better-educated citizenry due to the educational benefits derived from the museum such as lectures and classes hosted by the museum (this will lead to smarter people which will draw better companies and better jobs).\nThe city’s reputation will be enhanced, allowing for other quality of life enhancements like sporting teams and other economic enhancements like political conventions.\n\nQuestion #2: One of the areas that Joe, MAI’s curator, would like to look at is the revenue that the MAI has directly contributed to the Metropolis economy. What in particular would you look at?\nPossible Answer:\nThis may blend in with the above answer.\n\nDirect areas of economic benefit would be admissions prices to the museum, and receipts from the restaurant and gift shop.\nIndirect areas but attributable to MAI’s visitors would be revenues from hotels, restaurants, rental-car companies, and gas stations which are used by tourists coming to Metropolis to visit the MAI.\nOther indirect areas would be other tourist destinations that people would visit on the same vacation to Metropolis such as sports arenas, other museums, amusement parks, movie theaters, shopping malls, etc.\n\nQuestion #3: The MAI’s curator Joe would like to estimate some actual economic-impact numbers which he can show to the mayor’s office. What information would he need?\nPossible Answer:\nGive all this information, but the interviewee should ask for it first.\nExhibit 1. Annual MAI Visitors (Total – 220,000)\n\nQuestion #4: How would you interpret this information and quantify actual economic impact?\nAdditional Information:\nBased on some surveying, Joe knows the ticket price for MAI is $5 and the average visitor spends $10 at the restaurant and $15 at the gift shop.\nFurther, day tourists will visit the MAI and then leave Metropolis for home. Overnight tourists will stay in Metropolis an average of two days, spending $110 on a hotel room per night (two to a room), $50 on meals per person, an $30 per day for rental cars (two to a car), and $40 on other attractions on the day they don’t visit the MAI.\nAdditionally, of all overnight tourists, 75% cited the MAI has their main reason for visiting Metropolis.\nPossible Answer:\nFirst off, no revenue should be associated with local visitors since they aren’t bringing any additional money to the local economy (they are just taking it from one area of the Metropolis economy and putting it in another).\nFor day tourists the calculation is 46% of 220,000 which is about 100,000 visitors. If each pays $5 + $10 + $15 or $30 at the museum that amounts to $3,000,000 per year.\nFor overnight tourists the calculation is more complex.\n\nFor direct museum revenues the calculation is similar to the day tourists: 18% times 220,000 which is about 40,000 visitors times $30 at the museum which amounts to $1,200,000.\nAdditionally, 75% of the 40,000 visitors would not have come to Metropolis if it weren’t for the MAI so the profits from their whole stay should be credited to MAI. This is 75% of 40,000 visitors or 30,000 visitors times $55 (hotel per person) plus $50 (meals) plus $15 (rental car per day) which is $120 per day. 30,000 times $120 times 2 (they stay an average of two days) is $7,200,000.\nAlso, on the second day these tourists will stay in Metropolis and spend $40 at other attractions like amusement parks, sporting events, theaters, etc. This adds another 30,000 times $40 or $1,200,000.\nNo additional revenue should be added for the 25% of overnight visitors who would be in Metropolis regardless of the MAI because they would spend the money anyway.\n\nAll told, the MAI adds $3.0 million + $1.2million + $7.2million + $1.2million, or a total of $12.6 million per year.\nQuestion #5: You had mentioned one of the non-economic benefits as the increase in the quality of life of the citizens of Metropolis. How could you try to demonstrate this to the Metropolis Government?\nPossible Answer:\nThis would be extremely difficult to show. One way could be to do a public survey, but this is unlikely to provide any useful information for us. An alternative could to use property values as a proxy to say that the increase in the quality of life is reflected in the increase in the property values since MAI opened.\nQuestion #6: Given this graph of property values (see below Exhibit 2), what advice would you give Joe, the curator of MAI?\nExhibit 2. Property Value in Metropolis vs. Years since MAI Opening (MAI Opening = 100%)\n\nPossible Answer:\nThe analysis from the previous question showed the economic impact of MAI while this type of analysis tries to get at the non-economic, quality-of-life impacts of MAI. Property values would probably be a good proxy for a lot of those difficult-to-measure characteristics like happiness of citizens, quality of education, and civic pride, and this graph substantiates our hypothesis. The problem is it is difficult to measure how much of the increase in Metropolis’ property values are attributable to the MAI rather than other factors like general economic prosperity of the nation or other investments that Metropolis has made to encourage the city’s prosperity. This could be solved by using a regression analysis to compare the change in property values of cities with characteristics similar to Metropolis’.\nQuestion #7: The curator of MAI Joe is satisfied that he has a good case to present to the mayor and the city council. However, before that, he would like to have a press release to be printed in the local newspaper making his case for the additional funds. What advice would you give Joe on how to present his case?\nPossible Answer:\nThere are many good answers here, but here is one possible solution. Break the story into three parts:\na. Outline where the city was 8 years ago when the city had the original idea to build the MAI.\nb. Summarize the economic and non-economic benefits that MAI has brought to the city.\nc. Offer ideas on the types of programs and investments the museum would make with the additional $5,000,000 and how they would benefit the city, both in economic and non-economic terms. Also, it might be good to give some ideas of what the programs could be; this gives you a chance to be creative and show a little of your personality.\nSome examples might be developing a world-class painting restoration facility where other museums could send their work, providing sculpture workshops for at-risk high school students, and working with archeologists at the local university who are excavating a pre-Roman empire site in Turkey which is believed to contain many wonderful examples of frescos and murals.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: reduce cost.\nConsulting Firm: L.E.K. Consulting first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: energy; utilities.\nCase Interview Question #00807: Our client EDF Energy is a recently deregulated UK based electric company. Headquartered in London, England, EDF Energy trades electricity contracts, and sells electricity to the urban household market throughout the United Kingdom. The company employs more than 12,000 people and handles  5.7 million customer accounts.\nRecently, the UK began deregulating the gas and electricity markets, to open them to competition. In this new environment, our client EDF Energy is facing pressures to cut down their costs. They have hired us to help them identify the potential areas for cost-cutting, and to provide specific recommendations to control these costs. How would you about this?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate if requested)\n1. Client’s business\nThe client EDF Energy only trades electricity contracts. The actual distribution of power is handled by independent distributor grids, and the onus of delivery is with the electricity contract sellers.\n2. Customers\n\nHouseholds\nPrice sensitive\nLow switching costs\n\nPossible Answer:\nThis case focuses only on costs. The calculations focus on two elements – the existing capacity utilization as well as productivity increase, and can get interesting given all the numbers and the short time available in case interviews. The case also has other elements that hold a great potential for open discussion, namely call center dynamics, and cost issues in such electric companies.\n1. Qualitative Analysis\nInterviewer: Ask the candidate to brainstorm the possible cost issues the client is facing and guide him / her to come up with the following.\nThe major cost-heads would be\n\nTrade transaction costs\nHedging costs\nServicing cost including customer complaints handling\nBilling costs\nDebt Recollection\n\nThe first two are not areas that will yield sufficient benefits. Discussion on the other areas holds stronger merit. The case will focus on the third element: Service Cost.\nAdditional Facts:\n\nThe client EDF Energy has 7 call centers to service its customers.\nThese call centers are all across the UK – Liverpool, Manchester, London, Gloucestershire, Leeds and Birmingham\nCustomers call a toll free number for this service.\nCustomer satisfaction surveys reveal that 60% of the times, the customer calls do not reach the correct agent, and 90% of the redirected calls are routed to the wrong agent.\n\nInsights:\nThe client EDF Energy seems to be incurring huge expenses in maintaining so many call centers. The locations, in particular do not seem to be cost-effective since London and Manchester are big cities. There also seems to be scope to improve call-flows and streamline internal processes.\nTherefore the client can control costs by:\n\nLeveraging economies of scale by having fewer, but larger call canters.\nThe client can also improve worker productivity in these centers by ensuring better training, and having good incentive structures in place that reward based on customer satisfaction.\nCustomer feedback should be gathered regularly to streamline processes.\nClear responsibilities should be assigned to call service agents: Specialist versus generalist model for servicing could be debated.\nThere seems to be some scope of automating the call centers such that some operations such as balance checking as well as bill payment can be done without human interface.\nBetter process design along with sound telephone technology could ensure more efficient call routing.\n\nOther valid arguments:\n\nOutsourcing / Off shoring – This will not go down well with the UK population that prefers to talk with UK service agents.\nCharging for customer calls – This is not an option as that is not industry practice.\n\nConclusion: The client should focus on increasing efficiency of call center operations.\n2. Quantitative Analysis\nInterviewer: Assume only 2 call centers for the client. Should the client close the London call center and invest £3M to automate the Birmingham call center given that automation brings about an efficiency improvement of 25%?\nAdditional Information: Give the facts below – verbally. The Candidate should develop the table and then do the calculations below.\n\n\n\nCall Center\nBirmingham\nLondon\n\n\nNumber of Employees\n1,000\n500\n\n\nCapacity Utilization\n80%\n100%\n\n\nSalary per person (£)\n25,000\n25,000\n\n\n\nAverage Call time in minutes: 4\nNumber of hours worked: 10\nNumber of days worked per year: 200\nRetrenchment costs (workers are not transferable): £10,000\nHiring costs: £5,000\nCalculations:\n\n\n\nCall Center\nBirmingham\nLondon\n\n\nNumber of calls per year per agent\n(60/4)*10*200 = 30,000\n(60/4)*10*200 = 30,000\n\n\nTotal calls/year\n30K * 1000 = 30 MM\n30K * 500 = 15 MM\n\n\nAdjusted for capacity (Total Calls/year)\n30 MM * 80% = 24 MM\n15 MM * 100% = 15 MM\n\n\n\nTotal calls required to be made: 24 MM + 15 MM = 39 MM\nTotal call capacity at Birmingham: 30 MM\nAdditional benefit of 25% increase in efficiency (calls): 25% * 30 MM = 7.5 MM\nShortfall in calls: 39 MM – 30MM – 7.5 MM = 1.5 MM\nRequired number of new recruits: 1.5 MM / 30,000 = 50\nSavings on salaries by closing London call center: 500 * £25,000 = £12.5 MM\nAdditional Hiring Cost: £5,000 * 50 = (£250,000)\nRetrenchment Cost: £10,000 * 500 = (£5 MM)\nNet Benefit: £12.5 – £0.25 – £5 = £7.25 MM\nInvestment in automation: (£3.00 MM)\nNPV (assume 1 year only): £7.25MM – £3MM = £4.25 MM\n3. Recommendation\nThe project for combining call center operations is a positive NPV one. Considering that retrenchment costs and hiring costs will be one time (only a percentage of hiring costs will be incurred in the subsequent years due to employee turnover), the project looks like an attractive one. The client EDF Energy should go ahead with this, however keeping in mind some of the risks involved in this.\n4. Risks\nThere may be following risks involved here\n\nTechnological risk could be overcome by observing successful call center technologies in the market.\nWorker morale may suffer with the closure of operations and the ensuing downsizing; this may need to be approached through careful corporate communication.\nThere may be some loss of productivity while the automation is carried out. A phased approach will ensure continuity of business during the ramp-up.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: business competition, competitive response; operations strategy\nConsulting Firm: IMS Health Consulting Group first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: healthcare: hospital & medical.\nCase Interview Question #00808: Our client is Cordis Corporation, a medical devices manufacturer headquartered in Fremont, California, United States. The company develops and manufacturers diagnostic and interventional products to treat patients who suffer from coronary and peripheral vascular diseases. It was founded  in 1959 in Miami, Florida, and today its North American operations are based out of the San Francisco Bay area. Their product lines include stents, distal protection devices, catheters, and guidewires.\nCordis Corporation’s main competitor Biosense Webster Inc. is in financial crisis. Firstly, if you were the CEO of Biosense, going through a financial crisis, what options do you have?\nPossible Answer:\nThe interviewee should ask for clarifying questions and frame some structure to approach the case, no specific framework is recommended but the interviewee should ask for additional information about both companies to understand the situation, e.g. “I would like to know a little more about the two companies and the circumstances of the financial distress”:\n\nDoes financial distress mean they are about to file for bankruptcy? Have they defaulted on their debt payments?\nWhat is the market size, market shares, who are our client’s competitors besides Biosense, is the market fragmented, etc. How has the market structure been changing? Is the market growing? What are the key success factors?\nWhy is the firm in financial distress? How does its financial performance compare with our client? What is the industry profitability like?\nAre there any legal/regulatory reasons for the financial distress of Biosense?\n\nThe interviewer should provide the information below based on whether the candidate asked relevant specific questions:\n\nBiosense Webster is part of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), a big pharmaceuticals and medical devices conglomerate and Biosense manufactures coronary stents.\nCordis has a market share of 50%; Biosense has a market share of 30% (sales volume). Give this information only if the candidate has had some conversation and explored the topic under discussion.\nCordis is dominant among the big hospital segment.\nBiosense’s parent company Johnson & Johnson currently is under SEC investigation.\nMany of the Johnson & Johnson conglomerates business units are experiencing declining market share and profitability including Biosense.\nThe parent company Johnson & Johnson has $15B debt to be paid in 10 months.\n\nThe interviewer should observe the candidate’s thinking process. Did the candidate process the information that has been given? Does he/she have a structured thinking process? Do not stop after one or two suggestions but see if the candidate can come up with at least 4-5 suggestions. Ideally, a strong candidate should bucket the options into long/medium-term and immediate options.\n1. Immediate Options:\n(1) Improve cash-flow\na. Improve working capital cycle\n\nImprove receivables, stretch payables\nLiquidate inventory (drive sales by lowering price / promotions if required, based on adequate financial analysis)\n\nb. Cut costs\n\nSynergies with Parent company – G&A, manufacturing & distribution, selling & advertising, etc.\nSee if you can cuts costs in labor, material, operations–probably more sticky and difficult to achieve in the short-run. Look at the cost structure of your business and ask the interviewer if he could provide more information.\n\nc. Review planned capital expenditures\n(2) Negotiate debt roll-over\n2. Long-term Options:\n(1) Business restructuring / Product portfolio rationalization – cut unprofitable products/businesses; divest or kill\n(2) Restructure manufacturing – outsourcing?\n(3) Focus on improving market position – retaining and growing market share:\n\nProduct differentiation & innovation\nCustomer focus: improve customer satisfaction by catering to their needs in time and improving customer service.\n\n(4) Explore a merger with / sale to a competitor like Cordis.\n(5) Declare bankruptcy and restructure the debt.\nQuestion #2: Now, if you were our client Cordis Corporation’s CEO, what opportunities and threats do you see?\nPossible Answer:\nSome of the opportunities for Cordis:\n(1) Acquire Biosense. That would give 80% market share to Cordis. but this might result in anti-trust issues from the government.\n(2) Buy only some parts of Biosense that are profitable and a strategic fit to Cordis.\n(3) Continue to compete as it did in past and drive Biosense out of business\n\nPoach sales force\nTarget Biosense’s customer base\n\nSome of the threats to Cordis:\n(1) Biosense could lower prices and put pressure on Cordis’s prices and profits. The Candidate should also mention that since Biosense is in financial crisis, we have to do contribution margin analysis to see if lowering prices really helps bottom-line of Biosense.\n(2) Biosense could leverage the parent company’s network to sell products to big hospitals and at the same time compete on prices and try to increase market share.\n(3) Biosense could choose to focus on only the most profitable products in its portfolio and compete aggressively for those accounts.\n(4) In a similar vein Biosense could choose to focus on only certain high volume customer segments and compete aggressively on price.\n(5) Biosense might merge with other companies in the industry and be a stronger combined threat.\nQuestion #3: Now, let’s do some calculations for Biosense. All numbers in the data table below are $ millions.\nRevenue: 100\nCost Of Goods Sold (COGS): 50\nCost of Sales: 15\nR&D: 5\nGeneral and Administrative Costs (G&A): 10\nGross Profit: 20\nProfit Margin: 20%\nIf Biosense’s revenue increases to $120 M, how does their Gross Profit and Profit Margin look?\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate should provide the following analysis:\nVariable Costs\n\nCOGS will increase to $60M (20% increase in COGS from $50M)\nCost of Sales will increase proportionally (20%) to $18M.\nTherefore, variable costs = $60M + $18M = $78M\n\nFixed Costs\n\nR&D: $5M\nG&A: $10M\n\nTotal costs = $78M + $15M = $93M\nGross Profit = 120 – 93 = 27\n% Profit Margin = 27/120 = 22.5\nTherefore profit margins will improve.\nRevenue: 120\nCOGS: 60\nCost of Sales: 18\nR&D: 5\nG&A: 10\nProfit: 27\nProfit Margin: 22.5%\nQuestion #4: If Biosense can achieve the additional $20M sales only by offering a 20% rebate on the $20M above $100M how will their profit margin look?\nPossible Answer:\nFor new $20M revenue we have:\nCOGS: $10M (COGS are 50% of revenue)\nCost of Sales: $3M (cost of sales is 15% of sales).\nNow revenues = $100M + 80% * $20M = $116M\nCOGS = $60M\nCost of Sales = $18M\nTotal costs are the same as above, which is $93M\nTherefore, Gross Profit = $116M – $93M = $23M\n% Profit Margin = 23/116 = ~20%\nRevenue: 116\nCOGS: 60\nCost of Sales: 18\nR&D: 5\nG&A: 10\nGross Profit: 23\n% Profit Margin: ~20%\nSo, even if the company Biosense offers rebate on some products, profit margins remain the same (20%). Even though the percentage margins are the same, the absolute margins are better after rebates ($23M with rebates vs. $20M without rebates). Therefore, the competitor Biosense definitely has an incentive to give rebates on prices and increase revenue. This is a threat to our client Cordis.\nQuestion #5: Our client Cordis’s CEO does not want to lower the price of his product in response to Biosense’s offering of rebates. What should he do?\nPossible Answer:\nThe candidate should give some creative ideas. This question tests whether the candidate can think out-of-the-box. Some possible answers could be:\n\nProduct differentiation\nImage marketing\nProvide even better customer service\nBundle portfolio of products that a hospital needs and sell them as a package\nTarget big hospitals with high volume of orders\nIncrease R&D and develop new products to keep competitive advantage\nCommunicate to customers that with Biosense being in financial difficulties they are taking a risk by buying from a company which may not be able to offer a good level of service and product innovation.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new product; growth.\nConsulting Firm: Roland Berger Strategy Consultants first round full time interview.\nIndustry Coverage: food & beverages; restaurant & food service.\nCase Interview Question #00799: Our client Tim Hortons Inc. (known internationally as Tim Hortons Cafe and Bake Shop), is a Canadian multinational fast food restaurant, known for its coffee and doughnuts. It is also Canada’s largest quick service restaurant chain; as of September 2014, it has 3,665 cafes in Canada, 869 in the United States, and 56 in the Persian Gulf region. Tim Hortons holds 62% of the Canadian coffee market, compared to Starbucks, in the number two position, at 7%.\nIn the last few years, Tim Hortons has had no growth and is facing strong competition from Starbucks, which has opened many new locations in Canada. The management of Tim Hortons is considering selling ice cream in their cafe. Do you think that Tim Hortons should add ice cream to their retail stores? Please also explore other growth opportunities for Tim Hortons.\nPossible Answer:\nThis is a very high-level strategy case in which the candidate is expected to evaluate a new product idea for the client. It is important to assess the impact of introducing ice cream product on Tim Hortons’ business strategy and operations.  Additionally, the candidate should be evaluated based on creativity and structure in proposing new growth alternatives for the client. The candidate must form hypotheses along the way as information is relayed from the interviewer to the candidate.\nA superior candidate will be able to use his/her framework in a structured manner to determine whether ice cream should be added. This discussion should go beyond revenue and cost, i.e. brand identity, operational issues, etc.\n1. Sample Framework\na. Customers\nHow are the customers at Tim Hortons different from customers at Starbucks?\n\nTim Hortons: higher end clients who appreciate the coffee and the ambience the stores provide\nStarbucks: lower income group and coffee on-the-go\n\nWho eats ice cream?\n\nHeavily consumed by children\n\nb. Tim Hortons’ Value Proposition\nWhat differentiates Tim Hortons?\n\nAtmosphere generated by the large stores and comfortable chairs (this is as important as the coffee)\nHigh quality coffee\nExtreme customization of products\nHigh quality customer service\n\nc. Business Issues\n\nA large number of kids in a store would damage Tim Hortons’ most recognizable quality, the ambience it provides.\nTim Hortons’ high margin product lines in frozen drinks and baked goods would be affected by the introduction of ice cream leading to possible cannibalization of profits.\n\nd. Operational Issues\n\nFinding and dealing with a new supplier.\nCurrent stores are not equipped to store ice cream with freezers which would require major renovations, and could mean a smaller seating area.\nTim Hortons baristas would need to learn new processes for handling ice cream.\n\nInitial Recommendation\n(The candidate should summarize in 30 seconds): The client Tim Hortons should not sell ice cream in its stores because of potential profit cannibalization, conflicts with its current business model, and the need for major operational changes.\nAt this point, the interviewer should keep probing the candidate for more growth alternatives for the client Tim Hortons. Possible other growth opportunities:\na. Introduction of other new products\n\nIntroduce a non-specialty coffee (Starbucks has now done this with Pike Place Roast) as a special offer during tough economic times to compete with Starbucks.\nBegin selling ice cream in retail channels but not in their coffee shops (this is already being done).\n\nb. Expansion into new geographic areas\n\nAdditional suburban areas, slightly further semi-rural areas in Canada.\nSelective cities internationally, for instance, in Asia or Latin America.\n\nKey Takeaway:\nThe client Tim Hortons has some additional alternatives to explore growth that will fit its value proposition and leverage the competencies it has developed over time.\nSample Conclusions & Recommendations\nGiven the conflicting target market, potential profit cannibalization and major operational challenges between Tim Hortons’ business model and ice cream selling, it is not recommended that it starts selling ice cream product in its stores. Next steps include:\n\nAnalyzing the other suggested growth opportunities, and pick one or two that would meet Tim Hortons’ bsiness model.\nDevise how these new alternatives would solve Tim Hortons’s growth problem as well as help the company fight the competitors’ strategic move.\n\nPotential Risks\n\nThere is a risk the market migrates towards selling ice cream in cafes.\nThe new alternatives may not be enough to set Tim Hortons back on the growth track (not big enough, not profitable enough, or simply to not meet their expectations).\nTim Hortons’ growth issue is beyond new products and rest on more structural problems (excess of stores, growing lines and increasing costs of customization).\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Your consulting team has been hired by the CEO of Silverado to investigate the cause of their recent revenue decline. Also, he’d like your team to suggest possible corrective course of actions so that the company can restore its previous levels of growth. How would you go about it?\nAdditional Information: (to be handed to the candidate when requested) \nExhibit 1. Market share and growth trends \nAnnual Revenues in Millions of Dollars\n\n\n\n\n\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n\n\nCompetitors ($M)\n376.1\n393.2\n403.2\n417.3\n435.1\n\n\nSilverado ($M)\n23.9\n30\n37.8\n45.7\n52\n\n\nMarket total ($M)\n400\n423.2\n441\n463\n487.1\n\n\nSilverado annual growth (%)\n\n26\n26\n21\n14\n\n\n\nPossible Answer:\nThis is a case that the candidate will need to lead with the use of some directive questioning. The goal is to determine the cause of declining growth and provide suggestions to restore growth. Guide the candidate to begin with exploration of market size and Silverado’s market share relative to competitors.\nA strong candidate will quickly interpret the Revenue and Growth charts and recognize that the primary reason for slowing growth is that the market is maturing. The candidate should also be able to generate additional hypotheses regarding declining revenue growth if asked. A superior candidate will use estimated % growth rates for luxury vs. generic silverware to support their claim that growth in generic silverware is slowing, perhaps due to market saturation. The candidate should also benchmark the growth associated with additional revenue from a price change in the luxury market with historical revenue growth rates. A superior candidate will recognize though that the increase in revenue due to price will only improve the growth rate for one year, after which it will return to the lower rates. At the conclusion, the candidate should brainstorm other creative ideas to grow revenue such as introducing a middle tier product line or via an acquisition.\nQuestion #1: What are some potential reasons as to why Silverado’s revenue growth is declining despite increasing market growth?\nPossible Answer:\nOverall market is mature, with very low growth which is only likely to decline further in the future\n• Although Silverado’s growth is slowing, it is still outpacing the market\n• Any gains in excess of the market are zero sum gains from competitors\nSilverado’s market share has nearly doubled since 2007 and this growth is unsustainable\n• Increased competition is making it more difficult for Silverado to grow market share\n• Incumbent competitors are likely to retaliate and price war may be causing Silverado to lower prices or lose market share\nAdditional Information: (to be handed to the candidate)\nProducts\n\nSilverado has been selling luxury silverware for many years.\n5 years ago, Silverado created a new division and started selling generic brand silverware.\n\na. Revenue and cost by product mix\n\n\n\n\nPrice per unit\nUnits sold\nCOGS\n\n\nLuxury\n$150\n180,000\n13,770,000\n\n\nGeneric\n$25\n1,000,000\n19,750,000\n\n\n\nb.

As a result, the client should not realistically expect to realize the same rapid growth again as it has in the past. The client can generate substantial revenue growth by increasing the price to $240 (per unit) for luxury product segment, but this change will only inflate growth for one year and will be below peak growth rates over the last 5 years.\nPotential Risks\n\nInaccuracy of price elasticity report (may lose more customers)\nCost of additional capacity necessary for increasing generic output may not be economical\nSaturation of generic portion of the market may cause generic margins to go down\nOverall market growth for silverware may slow further, putting additional pressure on growth targets for Silverado.\n\nOther Possibilities\n\nIncreasing the price for the luxury segment is only a one-period solution for raising growth rates (by the next year growth will stabilize back at lower levels).\nGiven the wide price difference between luxury and generic segments, Silverado can consider creating a middle tier product brand to capture this segment.\nSilverado may want to consider acquisitions to restore previous revenue growth rates.\nGiven strong brand equity, Silverado may wish to explore other higher growth adjacent markets, e.g., cooking ware, appliances, where it can leverage the brand name.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: growth.\nConsulting Firm: KPMG Consulting first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: automotive, motor vehicles.\nCase Interview Question #00801: The client, Holley Performance Products, is an auto parts manufacturer based in Bowling Green, Kentucky. The company produces a single specific part in the car engine like carburetor. Holley, when based in Michigan, was one of the major producers of carburetors, being supplied as standard equipment on many Detroit-built automobiles.\nA carburetor is a device that blends air and fuel for an internal combustion engine. This is a simple and homogenous component. This product can be fitted in any car or make and it is an essential product with no substitutes in the market today. The client Holley Performance Products is doing OK. However, they are looking for growth opportunities.\nWhat opportunities should the client explore for growth? (They are looking specifically for both Revenue and Profit Margin growth – don’t say this upfront – see if the candidate asks for it and then give it to the candidate!). Ask the candidate to brainstorm around ideas for revenue growth. Ideally, the candidate would come up with 4 or 5 good ideas.\nAfter identifying the opportunities, please ask the candidate to explain the rationale for choosing these opportunities (or prioritize them) and list the ways in which we can execute these recommendations.\nPossible Answer: \n1. Relevant Questions and Data (Wait to see if the candidate asks for this relevant information before giving it to them).\nMarket:\n\nMarket Size: 100M units\nGrowth: Steady Growth (not relevant for case, but good question)\nTarget Segment: Mainly after market (used and new)\nGeography: North America Only\n\n2. One of the most critical factors for success in this business is efficient supply chain and strong distribution channel. Ignore supply chain for now and focus on the potential sales channels. Ask the candidate to brainstorm again about what the potential distribution channels are (they are listed in the table below). Ask the candidate to comment on the profit margins he/she expects to see in each channel.\nChannel Details (Let the candidate identify the key channels) – it is a good idea to print out the below table separately and show it as a slide)\n\n\n\nChannels\nSmall Mechanics\nCar Dealers\nMass Merchants\nAuto Parts Stores\n\n\nMarket Share (Units)\n40%\n20%\n20%\n20%\n\n\nMarket Price\n$85\n$70\n$50\n$60\n\n\nShare of Client’s Total Sales (Units)\n70%\n10%\n10%\n10%\n\n\nClient Production Cost\n$45\n$45\n$45\n$45\n\n\nClient Distribution Cost\n$10\n$5\n$5\n$5\n\n\n\nAs noted ask the candidates what they expect the price, distribution cost, and production cost to be across the different channels before giving the data. Purchasing power for Mass Merchants is clearly going to be higher and hence a lower price and margin for our client.\nIn the small mechanics we have higher distribution costs, since small mechanics are scattered, but if we create brand loyalty we can tend to charge higher prices. Continue to brainstorm around this subject for a couple minutes. The real test here is for the candidate to create a relationship with the interviewer. They should take this opportunity to demonstrate energy, creativity, and strong business skills.\n3. Continuing the case problem, good candidates will ask about and get the following additional information:\na. Client (Macro):\n\nShare Overall (Units): 30%\nBrand Image: Good, comparable to other big player in the market\nSales Incentive: Base salary plus a fixed % of $ sales\n\nb. Client (Operational):\n\nManufacturing: 3-4 plants, all in the U.S\nSuppliers/Raw Materials: All U.S. suppliers\n\n(the candidate should get bonus points if they suggest cost cutting measures by identifying opportunities for off-shoring the manufacturing facilities like competition. This is not directly relevant to the case question, so if suggested note it but push the candidate forward)\nc. Competition (One large player, the rest is fragmented):\n\nLarge player share (units): 30%\nSales Channels: Same as client\nManufacturing: Most plants in a low cost foreign country\nChannel Share: Not relevant\nBrand Image: Similar to client\n\nNote: there is no real brand awareness among customers and they only care about the product quality and service. Both our client and the other large player in the market are comparable in these aspects.\nd. Other Relevant Information:\n\nSmall mechanics value service more; Large channel customers don’t care about service as much\nService Definition (let the candidate brainstorm here): timely delivery, quick parts replacement, assistance with technical questions (from end customers and mechanics).\n\n4. Relevant Analysis and Answer Discussion\n\nIdentify the client’s unit sales and the market unit sales in each channel\nIdentify the profit/unit (price minus total cost) for each channel\nIdentify the client’s penetration in each channel (using market unit sales and client’s sales by channel)\nIdentify that the small mechanics channel is the most profitable and is only ~50% penetrated by the client. So, this is #1 priority for growth. Identify Car Dealers as the next most profitable channel and so on\nDevelop an effective way to increase penetration in the small mechanics channel\n\nSales incentive: Increase commission for sales to the small mechanics or tie the sales commission to the margin generated by the sale rather than just the revenue (which is the current incentive structure – the candidate should ask for this)\nIncrease training to sales to provide good service to the small mechanics\n\n\n\nCalculation Table:\n\n\n\nChannels\nSmall Mechanics\nCar Dealers\nMass Merchants\nAuto Parts Stores\n\n\nMarket\n40M\n20M\n20M\n20M\n\n\nMarket Price\n$85\n$70\n$50\n$60\n\n\nClient’s Sales (Units)\n21M\n3M\n3M\n3M\n\n\nUnit Margin\n$30\n$20\n$0\n$10\n\n\n\nExample Analysis:\n\nClient’s total sales: 30% of 100M Market = 30M units\nClient’s sales (units) in small mechanics: 70% of 30M = 21M units\nClient’s Unit Margin: $85 – $45 – $10 = $30\n\nThe rest of the answers the candidate should work out on his/her own. They are simple and working them out will help you prepare both as interviewer and, if applicable, as a candidate as well.\n5. Good Approaches:\n4P’s would be ideal approach – the key is to identify that the distribution is the focus area and drill deeper in this area.\nAfter identifying the channel to focus on, form clear recommendations (identify key business insights like purchasing power of Mass Merchant stores like Wal-mart, distribution cost differences across channels, and change to sales incentives).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: merger & acquisition (M&A).\nConsulting Firm: Strategy& (formerly Booz & Company) first round job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: building materials; manufacturing.\nCase Interview Question #00789: Your client CEMEX Espana, S.A. is a leading concrete manufacturer headquartered in Barcelona, Spain. Together with its subsidiaries, CEMEX Espana engages in the production and sale of cement, concrete, and mortar. It is also involved in the extraction commercialization of sand and gravel. It serves construction, residential, and industrial customers, as well as distributers primarily in Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Hungary, Germany, France, the United States, Egypt, Colombia, and Israel.\nRecently, the client CEMEX Espana, S.A. is considering acquiring Compañía Valenciana de Cementos Portland, S.A., a small local firm which is also very active in the concrete manufacturing industry. What factors should be considered in this acquisition case? After considering these factors, would you recommend the acquisition? Why or why not?\nAdditional Information: only provide if asked\n1. Client information\n\n20% profit margin\nBarcelona based\nEconomies of scale in operations\nCustomers are big construction companies – commercial buildings, infrastructure, etc.\n\n2. Target company information\n\nBarcelona based\n10% profit margin (expected to remain 10% post acquisition)\nCustomers are small business, local owners, contractors of individual houses, etc.\nHas a strong network of loyal customers\nSales are expected to double post acquisition\n\n3. Market\n\nCommercial market is highly saturated\nSmaller house-hold construction market is growing rapidly\n\n4. Financing the acquisition\n\nThe acquisition will be completely financed by a major bank\nBank financing will be at an interest rate of 10%\nAcquisition price will be at 3 times the annual sales of the target firm pre-acquisition\n\nPossible Answer:\n\nAcquisition Price = 3 × Annual Sales (pre-acquisition)\nInterest paid to the bank = 10% (interest rate) * Acquisition Price = 30% pre-acquisition Sales\nExpected Profits of target company = 10% (profit margin) * 2 * Sales = 20% pre-acquisition Sales\n\n1. Financial Perspective:\nInterest paid to the bank = 10% * Acquisition Price = 30% of Target Sales before acquisition. However, Sales are expected to double post acquisition and the profit margin of target company remains 10% of Sales after acquisition, which means that the profit margin of the target company would not be big enough to cover the full interest payment.\nSince the interest payment will be worth 30% pre-acquisition Sales, with the target’s margin of 20% of its pre-acquisition Sales, 10% of pre-acquisition Sales worth of interest payments will not be covered by the target’s profit margin. Hence financially the acquisition does not look attractive because the expected profit is not enough to cover interest expenses, even with expected doubling of sales post-acquisition, unless:\n\nThe client manages to renegotiate the loan with better conditions. In particular he needs to calculate the maximum interest rate in % he would be willing to pay. Critical point will be when Expected Profit >= Interest Payments\nThere are improvements in sales due to economies of scale and economies in processes from the client, which could make the economics different.\n\n2. Strategic Perspective:\nFrom a strategic perspective, our client CEMEX Espana, S.A. can leverage the target company’s networks: access to raw materials and to final customers is very critical. Additionally, process and technology can bring additional efficiencies in terms of fabrication costs. Geographical proximity and cultural similarity are added advantages and can ease the integration process. With all these reasons, on a strategic perspective the acquisition could be recommended, as it would allow diversification in the customers and revenues.\n3. Economic Considerations:\nHowever, market competitiveness and especially economic cycles or downturns should be carefully considered, analyzing both the future perspectives for both lines of incomes: (1) commercial buildings and infrastructure business, and (2) the individual houses business.\n4. Recommendation\nIf the acquisition was to happen in 2009 after the global financial market crisis, the recommendation would be NO. If it were today, maybe (depending on your optimism about economic recovery).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "title": "Buenos Aires to Build a New Bridge for Commuters",
        "url": "http://www.consultingcase101.com/buenos-aires-to-build-a-new-bridge-for-commuters/",
        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: pricing & valuation.\nConsulting Firm: Deloitte Consulting first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: government, public sector; transportation.\nCase Interview Question #00802: Buenos Aires is the capital and largest city of Argentina, and the second-largest metropolitan area in South America. It is located on the western shore of the estuary of the Rio de la Plata, on the continent’s southeastern coast. The population of Buenos Aires was 2.9 million according to 2010 census data.\nThe Buenos Aires city transportation system currently operates only one bridge, used primarily by commuters, to cross the main river that connects outlying areas to the downtown city area. Due to traffic congestion, the Buenos Aires city transportation authority is considering building an additional bridge to remedy constant one-hour or more waits in each direction during peak times. The new bridge would be ten miles away from the existing bridge, and, unlike the existing bridge, would charge a toll.\nYou have been asked to work with Buenos Aires Bridge Building Company to determine if the Buenos Aires city transportation authority should build the new bridge or not. If yes, what toll should it charge?\nAdditional Information: (to be handed to the candidate) \nSlide 1. Current Bridge Usage Statistics By Time of Day and Day of Week\n\nSlide 2. Spatial Map of Buenos Aires Bridge Area\n\nSlide 3. Peak Motorist Willingness to Pay (in dollars per crossing)\n\nSlide 4. Other Motorist – Daily Average Willingness to Pay (in dollars per crossing)\n\nPossible Answer:\nThis pricing and valuation case requires that the candidate gather as much numerical data as possible about the expected costs of building and maintaining the bridge, as well as information about the motorists who would use it. After data gathering, the candidate must construct a logical method to value the project. Answers to potential questions are as follows:\nA good candidate will engage the interviewer in a dialogue that bring out all the below information. However, since it is a great deal of information the interviewer should at times simply give out sections of it in a rapid style to test the candidate’s ability to think quickly and respond in a professional manner to fast input.\na. Cost of Building Bridge\nBasic – $10 million initial investment\nBasic – $3 million per year to maintain\nBasic – $0.50 per crossing variable/operating cost (includes estimated cost of labor and additional maintenance and training of staff , etc.)\nBetter – 10 year intended ROI/timing of break even point\nBest – Assume no taxes for all calculations\nBest – Assume no government subsidies toward the cost of building the bridge\nb. Toll Considerations\nBasic – Toll would be charged in both directions\nBasic – Toll must be charged in whole dollar amounts\nc. Commuter Considerations\nBasic – 190,000 bridge crossings each week on current bridge\nBasic – On existing bridge, 32,000 crossings each weekday, 15,000 crossings each day on weekends\nBetter – Hour-long waits occur only during peak times: 6AM-6PM on weekdays (show Slide 1).\n\nSlide 1 shows 20,000 weekday peak time crossings, thus 10,000 peak time motorists\nSince there are no waits below levels of 4,000 motorists, there are no weekend waits\nKey inference is that willingness to pay at peak times may be different than for non-peak times.\n\nBetter – Net time savings of commuter (do not answer — show Slide 2)\n\nSlide 2 shows a scaled spatial map of the area which includes both bridges and shows the distribution of where current bridge-users live/work.\nKey insight is that the new bridge is significantly less convenient distance-wise than the current bridge for the majority of the people who would use it, which may result in negative net time gain.\nThe candidate may be tempted to quantify average net time savings, but this would be impossible given the deliberate absence of certain data. Thus the candidate should be discouraged from this.\nThe only purpose for this slide is to test the candidate’s ability to interpret strange-looking graphical representations. Nothing shown in this slide is needed to properly value the project. It might lead candidate to explore how many motorists would be willing to use the other bridge at different times and toll levels, which IS needed to properly value the project (show Slide 3)\n\nBetter – Willingness to pay (show Slide 3)\n\nSlide 3 shows peak time motorists’ willingness to pay—specifically\n40% of motorists are unwilling to pay toll\n30% of motorists are willing to pay up to $1 per crossing\n20% of motorists are willing to pay up to $2 per crossing\n5% of motorists are willing to pay up to $3 per crossing\n5% of motorists are willing to pay up to $5 per crossing\n\nKey insight is that motorists willing to pay up to $5 per crossing are also willing to pay at the $3, $2, and $1 levels. Therefore, a total of 60% of motorists are willing to pay $1, 30% are willing to pay $2, 10% of are willing to pay $3 and 5% are willing to pay $5\nBest – Who other than peak time motorists is willing to pay to use the bridge? (show Slide 4)\n\nSlide 4 shows willingness to pay of non peak motorists. It tells us that\n5000 daily average of non-peak motorists are willing to pay up to $1 per crossing\n3000 daily average of non-peak motorists are willing to pay up to $2 per crossing\n2000 daily average of non-peak motorists are willing to pay up to $3 per crossing\n500 daily average of non-peak motorists are willing to pay up to $4 per crossing\nKey insight is that motorists willing to pay higher tolls are also willing to pay lower tolls\n\nThe candidate should notice that this is a daily average, based, therefore, on a seven day week\nMathematical Calculations\na. Cost of Building the Bridge\nThe “Cost of Building the Bridge” will be equal to the total fixed costs for each year until the desired break-even point.\nThe variable cost per crossing is best deducted from anticipated toll revenues, which are calculated in another section.\nCost of Building Bridge = Initial Cost + (Cost of Maintenance * # years before desired ROI)\nCost of Building Bridge = $10M + ($3M/year * 10 years) = $10M + $30M = $40M\nConclusion: Bridge must generate $4M per year in net revenues from tolls to reach desired ROI.\nb. Anticipated Motorist Usage\nThese calculations are designed to determine the total expected toll revenue per year. The basic formula for net toll revenue is as follows:\nToll Revenue = M * (t-0.5) * c * 50, where\n\nM = # of motorists willing to pay at a certain level\nt = dollar amount per crossing\n0.5 = deduction for $0.50 variable cost per crossing\nc = # of crossings per week\n50 = weeks per year (tell the candidate to use this number, as it is easier to work with)\n\nFrom Slide 1, we should have deduced that there are 10,000 peak time motorists, and we know that 40% of them are unwilling to pay toll (Slide 3). We can deduce from what we know from Slide 3 that:\n6000 motorists * net of $0.50/crossing * 10 crossings/week * 50 weeks/year = $1.5M/year\n3000 motorists * net of $1.50/crossing * 10 crossings/week * 50 weeks/year = $2.25M/year\n1000 motorists * net of $2.50/crossing * 10 crossings/week * 50 weeks/year = $1.25M/year\n500 motorists * net of $4.50/crossing * 10 crossings/week * 50 weeks/year = $1.125M/year\nThe thorough candidate has asked about the willingness to pay of non-peak motorists (Slide 4). We can deduce from what we known from Slide 3 that:\n5000 motorists * $0.50/crossing * 14 crossings/week * 50 weeks/year = $1.75M/year\n3000 motorists * $1.50/crossing * 14 crossings/week * 50 weeks/year = $3.15M/year\n2000 motorists * $2.50/crossing * 14 crossings/week * 50 weeks/year = $3.5M/year\n500 motorists * $3.50/crossing * 14 crossings/week * 50 weeks/year = $1.225M/year\nRemember that Slide 4 specifies that data is shown as a daily average, per motorist, which means that this calculation is based on a seven-day week, and that each motorist will logically make a two-way trip for a total of 14 crossings.\nc. Value of Bridge Project\nWe know the bridge must bring in $4M/year in net revenues in order for the project to go ahead.\nBy totaling customer willingness to pay at each level, we can determine whether the $4M net revenue goal can be reached, and, if it can be reached at more than one toll level, which one would be most profitable.\nTotal Revenue @ $x Toll = Revenue @ $x Toll for Peak Motorists + Revenue @ $x Toll for Others\nTotal Revenue @ $1 Toll = 1.5M + 1.75M = $3.25M/year\nTotal Revenue @ $2 Toll = 2.25M + 3.15M = $5.4M/year\nTotal Revenue @ $3 Toll = 1.25M + 3.5M = $4.75M/year\nTotal Revenue @ $4 Toll = 0 + 1.225M = $1.225M/year\nTotal Revenue @ $5 Toll = 1.125M + 0 = $1.125M/year\nCase conclusion is that yes, the bridge project can be profitable, and that the profit maximizing toll-level would be $2 per crossing.\nAnswer Discussion\nCertain points listed under “Possible Answer” section are labeled “Basic, Better, or Best”. Candidates who understand the question but lack depth of insight will mostly limit themselves to “Basic” items. Candidates who dig deeper, but not as deep as the most sophisticated set of questions and calculations limit themselves to “Better”. Candidates who cover most items under Basic and Better, and follow through toward completing a logical valuation can be classified as “Best”, though there is only one “Best” item. Because this case has a finite answer, candidates who display the “Best” qualities will incorporate additional insights that may not be pertinent in this case but that show thoroughness in logic and breadth of thinking. Examples of this would be asking about discount rates, NPV, taxes, government or regulatory issues, etc. The best candidates will pay attention to details such as legends on graphs, etc.\nThis case requires no specific framework. However, the more key issues candidates can identify by name, and the faster they can do so, the better we can say they have done on the case. Key issues and terms that should be identified in conjunction with this case include: valuation, fixed costs vs. variable costs, profitability, willingness to pay, profit-maximizing level, return on investment (ROI), volume of traffic, frequency of usage, peak/off-peak.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Records Inc. currently has an eclectic mix of bands on its roster, but is looking to expand more into heavier (metal) music.\nThe bands sing in English and display top notch musicianship.\nThe bands don’t have a problem with touring in the U.S. and are currently signed to small local labels in Scandinavia.\n\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate: I would like to start by evaluating how attractive the U.S. market for Swedish Melodic Death Metal is by estimating the market size and evaluating future growth.\nI would then do a net present value (NPV) analysis or if we do not have sufficient data to do that at this stage, calculate the break-even volume to estimate the market share we would need to garner and check if that is feasible.\nTo evaluate the feasibility of attaining the desired market share I would analyze the competition and the advantage our client’s company would have.\n1. Market Sizing (Provide the following information)\n\nTotal Number of Albums sold in the U.S. each year: 135 Million units\nTotal number of Metal Albums sold: 15% of Total = ~20 Million Units\nThere are three metal consumer segments\n\n\n\n\nMetal Consumer Segment\n% of Total Metal Consumers\nAverage Metal CDs purchased each year\n% of CDs they buy that are euro/death\n\n\nLoyal Fan (Igor)\n20%\n4 CDs\n60%\n\n\nMedium Fan (Tommy)\n30%\n2 CDs\n40%\n\n\nCasual Fan (Brad)\n50%\n1.2 CD\n0%\n\n\n\nCandidate:\n\nAssuming there are 100 consumers, then (20*4 + 30*2 + 50*1.2) = 200 CDs are sold.\nLoyal fan will purchase 80/200 of the CDs, equating to 40% of total metal CDs;\nThrough the same method, the medium fan will purchase 60/200 = 30% and the casual fan will purchase 30% of total metal CDs.\n\n\n\n\nSegment\n% Metal CDs\nUnits of Metal CDs\n% of CDs purchased that are Euro/Death\nUnits of Death/Euro CD\n\n\nLoyal Fan\n40%\n8 MM\n60%\n4.8 MM\n\n\nMedium Fan\n30%\n6 MM\n40%\n2.4 MM\n\n\nCasual Fan\n30%\n6 MM\n0%\n0 MM\n\n\n\nTherefore the total market for this “Swedish Melodic Death Metal” genre is ~7.2 million albums per year.\n2. Break-even Analysis\nCandidate: Having calculated the current market size for this genre, I would like to find out how much penetration will be needed in order to break even. Profits = Revenues – Costs.\na. Revenues\n\nWe will assume that the only revenue that the record label Warner Bros. Records will realize is from CD sales, and merchandise/concerts go straight to the band.\nWe will assume a current average price (at the end channel) of $12/CD.\n\nb. Costs: (give each of these following costs only when asked directly for by the candidate.)\nb.1. Fixed Costs\nRecording and production would usually be a cost, but we will assume that there is some excess capacity on studio time and production hours. Therefore these costs will not be significant.\nPromotion and Advertising are a fixed cost and there are three campaign “options”.\n\n\n\nPromotion Type\nCoverage **\nCost\n\n\nMinimum\nInternet\n$2 MM\n\n\nMedium\nLate Night MTV shows (i.e. Headbangers Ball)\n$5 MM\n\n\nMaximum\nRadio, Prime Time MTV\n$10 MM\n\n\n\n** Each promotion level is inclusive of lower level coverage plans. For example, medium promotion includes both Internet and Late Night MTV coverage.\nb.2. Variable Costs\n\nManufacturing (includes stamping, cases, artwork, etc) will be $2/CD.\nDistribution will cost $3/CD. (This will hold for online and record store distribution)\nBand Royalties that are usually paid on this label are $3/CD.\n\nCandidate: To evaluate the campaign options I would like to understand how our target segment makes its purchase decision – i.e .the effectiveness of each option.\nInterviewer: Give the candidate the following information\n\n\n\nSegment\nPurchase Decision Media\n\n\nLoyal Fan\nInternet\n\n\nMedium Fan\nLate Night MTV\n\n\nCasual Fan\nRadio, Prime Time MTV\n\n\n\nAfter this channel matching has been done, the candidate should calculate break-even values for each of these promotion plans.\n\nFirst begin by calculating the Contribution Margin: Price – Variable Costs = $12 – ($2+$3+$3) = $4/CD.\nNow the break-even values can be calculated by dividing each fixed cost option by the contribution margin.\n\n\n\n\nPromotion Type\nBreak Even Volume\nAudience Captured\n% Penetration Required\n\n\nMinimum\n$2MM/$4 = 500,000 Units\n5 MM Units\n10.0%\n\n\nMedium\n$5MM/$4 = 1.25 MM Units\n7.5 MM Units\n16.7%\n\n\nMaximum\n$10MM/$4 = 2.5 MM Units\n7.5 MM Units\n33.3%\n\n\n\nCandidate:\n\nIt’s obvious that the maximum promotion doesn’t benefit the situation and can be rejected outright.\nThe minimum plan is the safest option and goes after the fans that are most interested in the genre currently.\nThe next question to ask is how likely is it to get these rates? Intuition should not really be used here, and the candidate should ask more information about the competition and growth of the customer base in the future.\nThe candidate should ask about opportunity cost (especially if these fixed promotion costs can yield greater returns in other genres), but acknowledge the concern positively and make the assumption that it isn’t a factor in this case.\n\n3. Competition and Growth Analysis\nCandidate: Having analyzed that the market size is big enough for the economics to work out, I would like to evaluate the macro industry scenario and competitive landscape.\nInterviewer: (the following information can be given as asked)\n\nAs pointed out earlier, the current melodic Euro / Death CDs being sold in the U.S. are from European independent labels.\nThey are imported to the US currently, and thus carry a premium charge.\n\nThe candidate should probe the differences between the current availability of euro/death and what this new major record label Warner Bros. Records can bring.\n\nThe label Warner Bros. Records will provide wider distribution (better shelf location in the record store), better quality production (a very important factor to the loyal fan), and a cheaper price since there are no import fees.\n\nThus, taking around 10% of the market should be attainable given the advantages we have over the current offerings.\nThere isn’t much growth information, except that interest in the metal genre is growing in the U.S. and the medium segment has the greatest growth of all three customer bases.\n4. Conclusion:\nThe decision to go after loyal or medium fans is a bit fuzzy, and the interviewee could make arguments for both cases. However, there is definitely some value for a major record label to sign these bands given the current competition and growth trends. Given the data, this is a definite “Go” decision.\n5. Bonus Follow-up Question: Is there any way we can lower these break-even volumes?\nThe candidate should recognize this can only happen by raising prices or cutting costs.\nThe $12/CD is standard in the industry, and although the competition is currently charging higher for their offerings, we will assume that the label Warner Bros. Records has a strict policy on keeping standard prices.\nManufacturing/Distribution/Promotion are all standard costs and don’t have much room for negotiation. Band royalties, however, can be negotiated. The candidate should ask if they were paid differently (on the independent labels) in the past. The answer is that they were ($1/CD vs $3/CD) and this can be leveraged to lower risk for the first year of releases.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The company’s network consists of six containerboard mills, 94 converting facilities, two white paper facilities, eight creative design centers, 11 packaging and supply centers, two training and resource centers and one technical center. It has over 13,000 employees, with operations primarily in the United States and a converting operation in Canada.\nThe CEO of Packaging Corporation of America (PCA) needs help to improve the company’s industrial packing unit profitability. Industrial Packing (IP) is a business of manufacturing and selling of steel barrels. Barrels are cylindrical in nature and mainly used for packing liquid products for transportation or storage of products. How would you go about this case?\nQuestion #1: What are the characteristics of Industrial Packing industry that help drive profitability?\nSuggested Approach:\nA good candidate should asses the drivers evaluating each of the elements that affects the profitability:\n\nProfit = Revenue – Cost\nRevenue = Price/Unit * Units\nCost = Variable Costs + Fixed Costs = Cost/Unit * Units + Fixed Costs\n\na. Revenue:\n\nWhat is the current price comparing to the market (premium/average/low cost)?\nWhat is the demand elasticity? What drives the demand?\nDoes the client PCA have any differentiated positioning/asset (patent/distribution channel)?\nDoes PCA have any volume fluctuation? Why?\nHow is the rivalry and entry barriers in this industry? Not a patented product, low capital expenditure requirements, easy access to raw material.\nCustomers: Want suppliers with an ability to meet flexible demands? Tendency to shift to light weight substitutes (easily available)? Are customers willing to pay premium for superior quality?\n\nb. Costs:\n\nVariable costs: What are PCA’s variable costs? Raw material (steel), shipping, energy?\nFixed costs:  What are PCA’s fixed costs? depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A), capital costs and R&D might be drivers.\nSupply: High fluctuation in steel prices, limited suppliers.\n\nThus, in Industrial Packing industry two of the main profitability drivers are:\n\nAbility to utilize capacity and manage demand peaks\nProvide high quality product and service\n\nQuestion #2: Your client PCA agrees with these profitability drivers. Now what are the important aspects that should be considered in the supply chain to manage demand fluctuations and maintain quality?\nPossible Answer:\nSupply Chain: Inbound Logistics -> Production -> Outbound Logistics -> Sales & Marketing -> Customer Support\nInbound Logistics\n\nStrategic alliance with supplier: long term contracts to hedge price fluctuations\nProximity to steel suppliers\n\nProduction\n\nAim for product quality certification\nSpare Capacity for peak seasons\nWarehouse cost optimization\n\nOutbound Logistics\n\nOwn transportation vehicles to manage demand\n\nSales & Marketing\n\nAbility to manage short notices to lower customer switching\nPromote the PCA brand\n\nCustomer Support\n\nDevelop customer loyalty programs to stabilize demand and price\nInvolve customer in product development to increase loyalty\n\nQuestion #3: PCA is particularly interested in prioritizing between costs of over stock to manage demand variability vs. reducing warehouse cost. Can you help them to decide?\nAdditional Information: only provide if asked:\n\nAverage demand per week = 10,000 barrels\nDemand fluctuation = +/-20%\nDemand varies twice per month\nBarrel Price = $10\nCost of production per barrel = $5\nCost of storage per barrel = $5\n\nAssume 60% out of lost customers (due to insufficient production) place the order next time (this means 40% orders that are not met are lost)\nSuggested Solution:\nThus, the monthly demand projections are as follows\n\n\n\nWeek\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n\nDemand\n10,000\n12,000\n10,000\n8,000\n\n\n\nScenario 1\n\nRisks: Loss of trust and reliability by customers, outperform by competitors\nScenario 2\n\nRisks: Production losses due to unsold stocks\nConclusion\nBased on the above scenarios currently it costs PCA more to produce barrels at peak capacity and store in-house rather than opportunity cost of loosing sales.\nRecommendation\n\nTo produce barrels at average demand level and develop customer loyalty programs to stabilize demand.\nCross-functional team – Marketing, Sales, IT and Operations to collaboratively forecast demand accurately.\nAim to reduce the inventory storage cost. A $1 per barrel i.e. 20% reduction of storage cost makes it more favorable option.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The company is one of the world’s main producers of nitrogen fertilizer, with daily production capacity of 3,600 tonnes of ammonia and 4,400 tonnes of urea.\nThe client FertiNitro owns and operates a large fertilizer factory located near the south border of Venezuela. This particular fertilizer factory has been running at full capacity in the last year. The current market growth represents a relevant opportunity to the business. The CEO of FertiNitro wants to take advantage of this market trend to grow the business, but he is concerned about the production capacity of their south border fertilizer factory and asks you for advice. What would you recommend him to do?\nQuestion #1: What are some of the investment options to grow the business?\nPossible Answer:\nInvestment Options:\n\nDo nothing\nIncrease current factory capacity\nBuild a new factory\nAcquire an existent factory\n\nPossible qualitative Insights:\n\nEfficiency at a factory level driven by high utilization rates\nRisk of options, no investment means lower financial leverage\nRealization of scale economies (is this a market with high or low scale economies potential?)\nLimited growth ->  Limited value\nToo small to compete?

Could be high because of the financial risk, or could be low from an operational perspective, since it involves acquiring a business which is already running (operations, clients, etc.), compared to building a new factory.\nThe candidate should recommend one of the alternatives to develop an additional high level analysis.\nQuestion #2: After this high level analysis, the CEO believes that “increase capacity” and “build new factory” are the two best options, so let’s run some numbers to decide what would be the optimal option. He wants your advice to weather increase the current factory capacity or to build an additional factory.\nAdditional Information: Only provide if asked:\nCurrent factory capacity: 750 ton/day\nWith an investment of $100,000, current factory capacity can be increased by 300 ton/day\nNew factory capacity: 750 ton/day\nMarket demand growth rate: 15%/year\nInitial investment of building a new factory: $300,000\nInitial investment of increasing current factory capacity: $100,000\nCurrent factory is located far from the customer market\nIncremental Variable Cost of current factory (logistic and transportation): $3/ton\nMarket share stays the same\nProduction variable costs are the same in both cases (apart from transportation ones)\nFinancial costs are not included in the calculation.\nSuggested Solution:\n1. Market size\nAt year 0, market demand = full capacity = 750 ton/day * 260 day = 195,000 ton\nMarket demand growth rate = 15%\n\nYear 0: 195,000\nYear 1: 195,000 * 1.15 = 224,250\nYear 2: 257,888\nYear 3: 296,571\nYear 4: 341,056\nYear 5: 392,215\n\n2.

Based on forecast of market demand, even after expanding the current factory, its full capacity (273,000 ton/year) will only be able to meet market demand up to Year 2. By building a new factory, the client will not reach its full capacity again until Year 5.\nConclusion\n\nThe candidate must recommend construction of a new factory.\nReasons: supply demand and reduced costs.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: finance & economics.\nConsulting Firm: Capital One first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: consumer products.\nCase Interview Question #00792: Price Chopper Supermarkets is a chain of supermarkets headquartered in Schenectady, New York. The chain opened its first supermarkets in New York’s Capital District in 1932, and changed its name from Central Market to Price Chopper in 1973. Currently Price Chopper operates 137 stores in Upstate New York, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire.\nRecently, a Price Chopper supermarket decides to offer a price promotion in a specific brand of milk powder for babies. The campaign will last for a week. The Chief Marketing Officer of Price Chopper affirms that the price reduction campaign will be a profitable initiative. His main reason is that the demand for baby milk powder is quite stable and there are several brands in the market. However, the CEO of Price Chopper suspects that the price promotion campaign is not a good idea and asks for your help to evaluate it. How would you go about this case?\nAdditional Information: Only provide if asked\n\nInitial price: $10/unit\nInitial sales volume: 150 unit/week\nDiscount: 25%\nAdditional sales volume due to the promotion: 150 unit\nInitial profit margin: 50%\nAdditional customer traffic does not lead to more purchase of other products of the supermarket.\n\nPossible Solution:\nThis case tests a candidate’s understanding of “Price Elasticity of Demand”. Price elasticity of demand (PED) is a measure used in economics to show the responsiveness, or elasticity, of the quantity demanded of a good or service to a change in its price. The candidate should consider the profitability analysis of the price promotion initiative:\n\n\n\n\nPrice (a)\nDiscount (b)\nProfit margin (c)\nUnit profit (d=a*c)\nCost (e=a-d)\nVolume (g)\nTotal Profits (h=d*g)\n\n\nRegular Scenario\n$10\n25%\n50%\n$5\n$5\n150\n$750\n\n\nPrice Promotion\n$7.5\n\n\n$2.5\n$5\n300\n$750\n\n\n\nAs the price is reduced, sales volume increases, and short-term total profits are the same for both options. The candidate should then explore additional pros and cons to assess the price promotion campaign:\nThe promotion will not increase the market volume for feeders due to the stable nature of their demand. Exceptions: if the promotion is able to shift demand to the feeders market, from one of its substitutive goods.\nProducts for babies have price elasticities much lower than average so the incremental sales volume of the promotion could be challenged.\nIf the promotion does not increase overall demand, it will have two different effects:\n\nSteal market share from competitors; in this case, there is potential for customer acquisition\nReduce future demand as consumers stock up, as consumers can foresee future product needs; In this case, short-term profits will be the same, but the promotion will cannibalize future sales, hence reducing mid-term profits.\n\nAdditionally, such a price promotion campaign would bring in additional costs (advertising, labeling, changes in billing systems, etc.)\nBased on the additional analysis, the candidate should conclude that the price promotion is not a good idea for the client.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

(NASDAQ: ASNA) is a large national retailer of women’s clothing headquartered in Mahwah, New Jersey, United States. Ascena owns the Dress Barn, Ann Taylor, Maurices, Justice, Lane Bryant, and Catherines clothing store brands, with revenues of about USD $6 billion in FY 2014.\nRecently the client has experienced declines in both revenue and profits. They attribute these declines to both changes in consumer tastes as well as decreased investment in several brands due to the desire to preserve capital during the recent downturn. There are two units they are interested in potentially divesting:\nAnn Taylor: a young women’s professional clothing retailer with sales of $500M last year (cater to 18-30 year old women).\nDress Barn: a fashion forward clothing retailer offering both professional and casual clothing at competitive prices, with sales of $675M last year (cater to 35-55 year old women).\nYou have been hired by the CEO of Ascena Retail Group to determine the most viable business unit to divest and plan for the separation of the unit from the firm, while maximizing shareholder value. Specifically, there are three questions for you to address:\n1. What things will the firm need to consider when selling one or more of their business units?\n2. Which business unit of the two initially decided upon should Ascena Retail Group consider selling to strengthen its cash reserves and deliver the most value to shareholders? What price should they target for each unit?\n3. To sell additional work to the client what ideas would you recommend to Ascena Retail Group to strengthen their business?\nAdditional Information:\nNote: the following tables are for the interviewer to provide upon problem statement clarification. No other data will be provided outside of the tables given. Assumptions are OK and encouraged.\nTable 1.

(continue to probe until the interviewee declines for exploration)\nPossible Answer:\nNote to interviewer: this should be a brainstorming session and focused on retail business, force the interviewee to continue to provide ideas until they say they have explored all they think they can.\nCulture/People Impact: Selling off assets can disrupt your employees and impact the image of the company. Retaining key talent is also very important to maintaining the strength of the company. Employees may worry about what will be sold next, and be less effective until they know better.\nImpact to Revenue: Although these units have been viewed as underperformers, it will be important for the firm to make sure they explain the impact to earnings to shareholders and think how decreased earnings could affect their borrowing options in the future.\nPotential Buyers: Need to understand who the potential buyers will be and what selling to them will do to the clients’ competitive position. Will this change give a competitor strength over the client?\nSeparation: Considering the separation issues that will occur is important. IT, stores, shared space in malls, distribution of products and suppliers are all important for performing a smooth transition to a buyer.\nQuestion #2: Which business unit of the two initially decided upon should Ascena Retail Group consider selling to strengthen its cash reserves and deliver the most value to shareholders? What price should they target for each unit? (Note to interviewer: Provide data sheet to the candidate)\nPossible Answer:\nBased on the data provided, the candidate should walk through the tables and determine:\n\nRevenues and profits have been decreasing at Ann Taylor while increasing at Dress Barn.\nA good answer is when the candidate simply takes the average Price-Earnings Ratio from each deal table they will determine that the implied potential price for Ann Taylor is $1.2B (16 P/E x $75M = $1.2B), and for Dress Barn $1.89B (14 P/E x $135M = $1.89B).\nA better answer will see that the P/E’s used to value similar firms to Ann Taylor most recently have been higher, at 20 and would yield a price of $1.5B (20 P/E x $75M = $1.5B). Similarly, the P/E has been declining for Dress Barn to 10, and would result in a price of $1.35B (10 P/E x $135M = $1.35B).\nThe other table will show that the Ann Taylor customer segment (18-30 year old women) is growing fast, while Dress Barn’s (35-55 year old women) is actually declining, but the revenue is actually projected to grow faster for Dress Barn than Ann Taylor. The number of competitors does not drive much of the analysis. (These facts should supplement their choice)\n\nThe candidate should decide which business unit they would select to sell and defend their choice:\n\nAnn Taylor: Higher price based on most recent P/E multiples, fast growing segment with increase spend could yield upside to a buyer and thus result in a higher price.\nDress Barn: Lower price based on recent P/E’s but if using average higher price. Revenues and profits have been increasing and revenue is projected to grow faster even with a slight reduction in spend.\n\nQuestion #3: To sell additional consulting work to the client, what ideas would you recommend to Ascena Retail Group to strengthen their business?\nPossible Answer:\nImproved Pricing\n\nCould examine their current pricing structure and ensure price realization is maximized\nPromotion strategy: when to promote, who to target, what to promote, etc\n\nNew Market Opportunities\n\nThey may be able to target new customer segments or sell new classes of products to existing customers\n\nAcquisitions\n\nCould use the proceeds from the sales of an underperforming unit to buy a smaller player in a different space to enhance the companies’ portfolio of brands\n\n4. Conclusion\nThe client should sell Ann Taylor for $XB or Dress Barn for $XB (Note to Interviewer: rationale should come from their defense earlier, either answer is reasonable, the key is to make them choose one and stick to it).\nAssist the client by:\n\nCreating a clear plan and strategy to effectively separate the businesses\nMaximize value to shareholders by attaining the best price\n\nRisks:\n\nSelling to a competitor and providing them opportunity to succeed at our expense\nNot calculating the right value\nLosing talent to attrition and fear of being sold\n\nNext Steps:\n\nIdentify potential buyers\nEstablish Day 1 and Day 2 plans for separation after client sale\nWork with client to sell additional work highlighted earlier.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new business; market sizing.\nConsulting Firm: Oliver Wyman first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: utilities; automotive, motor vehicles.\nCase Interview Question #00793: Iberdrola is a Spanish public multinational electric utility company based in Bilbao, Basque Country. Iberdrola has a workforce of around 31,330 employees in dozens of countries on four continents serving around 31.67 million customers. Since embarking on its growth and international expansion plan in 2001, Iberdrola has become Spain’s largest energy group by market capitalisation, the global leader in wind energy and one of the world’s largest utilities by market capitalisation. The company is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.\nYour client Iberdrola is a major provider and distributor of electricity in Spain. Recently, the CEO of the company wants to enter into the business of distributing energy to electric vehicles (cars and motorcycles) in Spain. Is this an attractive market to enter? What is the market size of the Spanish electric vehicle market?\nQuestion #1: How would you structure an analysis to see the business attractiveness and what elements or factors would you consider in this analysis?\nSuggested Solution: \nTo evaluate if a new business opportunity is attractive or not, both business profitability and growth should be considered. Specifically, the analysis can be structured into External and Internal factors.\n1. External Analysis\nCustomer\n\nMarket size of electric cars in Spain (current, growth, fleet renew)\nSegmentation and specific needs\nPrice elasticity\nPreferred distribution channel\n\nCompetitors\n\nNumber of competitors\ndegree of competition\ncharacteristics of the competitors (offering only power for cars or vertically integrated energy operators)\ncurrent market dynamics\npotential alliances\n\n2. Internal Analysis\nCompany\n\nCurrent capabilities on which to leverage (customer base, presence in distribution channels, brand, size, capacity to invest)\n\nProduct\n\nNature of the product\nStage of the life cycle\nIdentify substitutive and complementary products\nPotential for differentiation, etc\n\nQuestion #2: How many electric charging stations are needed to supply the Spanish electric vehicle market?\nAdditional Information: Provide only when asked\nThe interviewee should guess or estimate figures prior to data being provided.\n\nMany people have at home charging stations they use to charge their electric vehicles, on-road recharging stations are used sparingly as needed.\nSpanish population: 48 million\n60% of all people in Spain have a vehicle\n0.2% of all vehicles in Spain are electric vehicles\nOn average, each vehicle is charged every 5 days\nAverage number of plugs per charge station: 2\nAverage charge time: 2 hours\nRecharge station utilization: it’s estimated that plugs are only used at 30% capacity\n\nPossible Answer:\na. Estimate the total number of electric vehicles to be charged per day\n\nSpain population = 48 Million\nSpanish owning vehicles = 48M * 60% = 28.8M\nSpanish driving electric vehicles = 28.8M * 0.2% = 57,600\n% electric vehicles charged daily = 20%\n# electric vehicles to be charged daily = 57,600 * 0.2 = 11,520\n\nb. Estimate the number of electric vehicles charged per station per day\n\nAverage number of plugs per station: 2\nAverage charge time per plug: 2 hours\nRecharge station capacity utilization: 30%\n# vehicles charged per station per day = 24 hours * 30% * 2 plugs / 2 hours = 7\n\nc. total # electric vehicles / # vehicles charged per station = 11,520/7 = ~1,600 charging stations\nTherefore, approximately 1,600 electric car charging stations are needed in Spain.\nAn excellent candidate will also mention the fact that electric recharge stations are not as widely available as regular gas stations. If we assume that electric vehicles are only available in the 20 biggest cities in Spain, then charging stations are also not evenly spread among population. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: improve profitability.\nConsulting Firm: McKinsey & Company first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: banking.\nCase Interview Question #00819: Our client TD Bank, N.A., is a United States national bank headquartered in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. It offers retail banking services in 15 states and Washington, D.C. TD Bank has a large retail footprint and offers a mix of services to end customers (checking, debit cards, credit cards). They also have loan centers to sell mortgages in the same markets. The bank currently serves 15 million customers.\nOur client TD Bank has historically been very profitable, but increased regulation from the Federal Government and the recent downturn in the U.S. economy have caused the bank to see a sharp decline in profitability. The client has engaged McKinsey & Company to help determine the next steps for its business and has asked us to assess ways they can increase profits within the next 12 months. How would you go about this case?\nAdditional Information: to be provided upon request\nEnsure the candidate is familiar with how a bank earns its profits (e.g. the spread between what they lend money out at and borrowing costs, fees on various services).\nNote that this is a typical McKinsey style interviewer-led case. There are eight questions that the Interviewer will ask the Interviewee.\nQuestion #1: What are some of the ways the bank can increase profits in the next 12 months? \nPossible Answer:\nA good answer is structured and contains a comprehensive set of ideas to both reduce costs and boost revenues as well as clear examples. The interviewee should use a Profitability framework (Profits = Revenues – Costs) to approach this problem. Answers include but are not limited to:\nI. Reduce Costs\na. Fixed Costs\n\nReduce under-performing branches (close branches, lease branches to other banks)\nReduce workforce (e.g., push greater use of online channels for banking, outsource functions)\nConsolidate the branches and the loan centers\n\nb. Variable Costs\n\nReduce costs associated with transactions (paper free, decrease error rate)\n\nII. Increase Revenue\na. Quantity\nb. Current Customers\n\nCross-sell different products (home purchase mortgages, refinancing, credit card, debit card, money market, advisory services)\nChange product mix to higher revenue products\nGet rid of unprofitable customers\n\nc. New Customers\n\nIncrease Number of customers\nProduct Mix\nLaunch new products\n\nd. Price\n\nIncrease bank fees (Debit card fees, ATM fees, call center fees)\nRaise rates charged\n\nQuestion #2: We have worked with our client TD Bank to narrow down their options to two choices. The first is shutting down unprofitable retail locations, the second is a better customer segmentation strategy. Let’s explore both. First, what are some of the risks with shutting down branch locations?\nPossible Answer:\nThere are a number of ways to think this through – look for the structure in how the candidate responds. A good answer includes, but is not limited to:\na. Near Term\n\nPoor PR\nLegal/contractual complications\nExtra costs (severance)\nLose a portion of customers who bank through that branch\nSelling off assets could scare investors\n\nb. Long Term\n\nWhat happens when the market rebounds?\n\nQuestion #3: The second option the bank is considering is a better retail segmentation strategy: What segments do you think a retail bank has?\nPossible Answer:\nThis response could have a lot of answers. Look for clear delineation between customers who are profitable and unprofitable and then list characteristics of each (i.e. Segment 1 is mass affluent and is highly profitable, uses checking accounts, has a money market account, and has a mortgage with the bank; they are low cost as they generally use ATMs and the internet to manage their transactions; Segment 2 is lower income, keeps a small balance in checking, uses tellers and call centers often) etc.\nNote: Ensure the candidate does not spend too long on this question.\nQuestion #4: Can you take a look at the below chart and walk me through what the bank is experiencing? Please walk the interviewee through any questions they have on the chart in Exhibit 1.\nExhibit 1. Our client TD Bank has 5 distinct groups of customers (Annual $ per customer*)\n\n* 15,000,000 customers\nPossible Answer:\nKey insights include, but are not limited to:\n\nOnly 30% of the bank’s customers are currently profitable\n20% of the banks customers have low revenue potential and could be eliminated\nOur client needs to change the mix of products from group 1 and 2.\n\nQuestion #5: What is the average annual profitability of a customer?\nPossible Answer:\n\n\n\nCategory\nProfit ($)\nPercent of clients\nWeighted profitability\n\n\nGroup 1\n-5\n30%\n-$1.50\n\n\nGroup 2\n-25\n20%\n-$5.00\n\n\nGroup 3\n-5\n20%\n-$1.00\n\n\nGroup 4\n15\n10%\n$1.50\n\n\nGroup 5\n45\n20%\n$9.00\n\n\nTotal\nN/A\n100%\n$3.00\n\n\n\nAverage annual profitability of a customer = $3.00\nQuestion #6: What is the annual bank profitability?\nPossible Answer:\nTotal Customers = 15,000,000\nAverage Profit per customer = $3.00\nTotal Profit = 15M * $3.00 = $45M\nNote: If the interviewer decides to calculate each group out individually, push them to look for shortcuts.\nQuestion #7: Our client has decided to institute a $0.85 fee each month for all checking accounts. We have advised them that they will lose a number of customers. We expect the following % of customers to remain (read this chart to interviewee):\nPercent of customers that remain\n\nGroup 1: 60%\nGroup 2: 40%\nGroup 3: 20%\nGroup 4: 60%\nGroup 5: 50%\n\nWhat is the new annual profitability per customer?\nPossible Answer:\n\n\n\nSegment\nProfit ($)\n% of Customers\n% customers that will stay\n# of remaining customers\nProfit per group (without fee)\nProfit from fees (@$10 per year)\nTotal profit per segment\n\n\nGroup 1\n-$5\n30%\n60%\n15M*0.3*0.6 = 2.7M\n-$13.5M\n$27M\n$13.5M\n\n\nGroup 2\n-$25\n20%\n40%\n15M*0.2*0.4 = 1.2M\n-$30M\n$12M\n-$18M\n\n\nGroup 3\n-$5\n20%\n20%\n15M*0.2*0.2 = 600K\n-$3M\n$6M\n3M\n\n\nGroup 4\n$15\n10%\n60%\n15M*0.1*0.6 = 900K\n$13.5M\n$9M\n$22.5M\n\n\nGroup 5\n$45\n20%\n50%\n15M*0.2*0.5 = 1.5M\n$67.5M\n$15M\n$82.5M\n\n\nTotal\nN/A\n100%\nN/A\n6.9M\n$34.5M\n$69M\n$103.5M\n\n\n\nNew average Profit per Customer = $103.5M/6.9M = $15\nNote 1: If the interviewee is running out of time, help them along to ensure they get to conclusion, e.g. ask them for their approach.\nNote 2: Feel free to let the interviewee round off numbers here, e.g. suggest $0.85 per month should become $10 per year.\nQuestion #8: You are walking down the hall and run into the CEO of TD Bank, he wants to know your recommendation. What would you tell him?\nPossible Answer:\nA good answer includes, but is not limited to:\nConclusion: The client TD Bank should institute a bank fee in order to meet the initial goal of increasing profits. This is the quickest way to earn new streams of revenue, while segmenting out the unprofitable customers. By instituting a fee the client will be able to increase profit by 5x per customer on an annual basis.\nNote: The interviewee should include a detail or two on each group and how they are able to increase profits (e.g. Group 3 was losing $3M per year we are now earning $3M in profit from them on an annual basis).\nRisks\n\nBad PR\nHigh transaction costs as people try to figure out if they are affected\nEstimates could be off\nLose customers that could become profitable in the future\n\nNext steps\n\nMove forward with instating the fee\nLook at exempting certain groups from the fee.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Headquartered in the St. Paul exurb of Bayport, Minnesota, the company employs more than 9,000 people at more than 20 locations. Andersen’s product lines  offer 100, 200, 400, and A-Series windows.\nThe client company was named as the top window products brand in terms of brand familiarity, most used and quality rating by the Builder magazine in 2005. Andersen Corporation and the affiliates they comprise, are one of the largest window and door manufacturers in North America. The CEO of Andersen is looking to grow revenues and has asked for your help. What recommendations would you give him?\nAdditional Information: to be provided after relevant questions\nThe client Andersen Corporation manufactures three types of windows, all for residential buildings: (a) a premium window, (b) a mid-range product line, and (c) an economy line.\nBetween the three product lines there is not significant differentiation in actual quality, but the premium products do have additional features.\nOur client Andersen positions all of its product lines based on superior functionality.\nProducts are distributed by specialty retailers, hardware stores, and supercenters (such as Walmart, Home Depot).\nThe U.S. window market has 3 large players and a large number of small “mom and pop” manufacturers.\nOur client Andersen’s market share varies significantly regionally in the U.S.\n\n\n\n\nSouth\nNortheast\nMidwest\n\n\nPremium\n5%\n60%\n30%\n\n\nMidrange\n7%\n45%\n20%\n\n\nEconomy\n5%\n8%\n5%\n\n\n\nThe overall size of each of the segments is the same.\nCurrently the company only distributes its product in the US.\nThe company is profitable and has been for many years.\nPossible Answer:\nI began by trying to better understand the window industry and the client company. I was provided with additional information at this point about the three segments, but not market share numbers. I then further explored into the product lines and was given market share information.\nKey insights:\n• Many of the windows are designed with features that are usefull in cold regions not hot ones.\n• The client’s economy windows are still more expensive than the competitions.\nNext, I explored ways that the client company could grow revenues including:\n• International Expansion\n• Focusing on distribution and sales in the South\n• Increasing market share in the economy segment\nThe interviewer then asked me why we might have lower market share in the South and economy. It was then revealed that many of the features our client focuses on are designed for cold weather, not sun/heat. Additionally, our economy line windows are still more expensive than competitors that offer very few features.\nRecommendation:\nIn order for the client to grow revenues they should consider:\n1. Acquire a small player with strength in the South and economy segments: since there are so many small players and our client has been profitable this should be possible.\n2. Reduce features and reposition the economy product line: this should allow the company to reduce costs (with fewer features) and be able to compete better against economy competitors.\n3. Expand internationally: I suggested starting in Canada, since our windows are superior for cold environments.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: reduce cost; investment.\nConsulting Firm: McKinsey & Company first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: leisure & recreation; non-profit organization.\nCase Interview Question #00822: Your client is the British Museum which has an “encyclopedic” range of attractions. Established in 1753, the British Museum is a museum dedicated to human history, art, and culture, located in the Bloomsbury area of London. Its permanent collection, numbering some 8 million works, is among the largest and most comprehensive in existence and originates from all continents, illustrating and documenting the story of human culture from its beginnings to the present.\nThe British Museum is a not-for-profit non-departmental public body sponsored by the U.K. Department for Culture, Media and Sport. And as with all other national museums in the United Kingdom it charges no admission fee, except for touring exhibitions loaned to other museums. On average they receive 5 million visitors a year and currently break even with £50M of revenues and costs.\nDue to budget cut, the British government has just told them that they are withdrawing £5M of funding next year and the museum has hired McKinsey & Company in to look at some of their costs and revenues streams.\nAdditional Information: to be provided after relevant questions\n1. Touring Exhibits \n• One revenue stream is touring exhibitions. Each year the British Museum sends on average 12 exhibitions to another museum. The average cost per exhibition is £60K.\n• Revenues for touring exhibits over the last seven exhibitions: £80K, £70K, £70K, £60K, £40K, £40K and £50K.\n• Variable costs comprise most of the exhibits cost (insurance, traveling curator, transportation, etc)\n2. Capital Investments\n• Each year they get £6.0M the government to invest in capital projects and they want us to determine their returns.\n3. Previous year investments\n• £1.5M in building maintenance.\n• £3.0M in fixing the main courtyard and advertising that it was fixed (most of it was spent on advertising).\n• £1.5M on installing security cameras.\n4. The additional advertising brought in an extra 10% of visitors.\n• Each visitor brings in £3 in contributions from fees and £3 contribution from profits in the gift shop.\n• Assume visitors will not come again and will not tell any friends.\n5. The security cameras are part of a 5 year project where the same amount of money will be invested each year.\n• The British Museum saves £500K on security guards for the first 5 years and £1M per year afterwards.\nPossible Answer:\nInterviewer: First, let’s talk about their revenues streams. What are your thoughts?\nCandidate: Well, the total income over the last 7 exhibitions is £80K + £70K + £70K + £60K + £40K + £40K + £50K = £410K and the total cost is £60K * 7 = £420K. Hence on the average we lose money – ignoring any discount factor.\nInterviewer: OK, What do you propose?\nCandidate: An number of options:\n• Focus on the big exhibits (e.g. £80K and £70K exhibits) which make money and cut out the small, less profitable ones.\n• See if we can send exhibits to more than one location.\n• Only do exhibits in the good years, and store them during the bad years.\nInterviewer: OK, let’s focus on sending them to more than one museum. What do you think the costs are?\nCandidate: Obviously there will be some fixed costs to get each exhibit ready, but the main costs will be variable, in particularly insurance and specialized packing/transportation. So it may only be profitable to send to more than one location if the additional transportation costs are smaller than the net revenues.\nInterviewer: Excellent, they also send a curator along with each exhibit. The museum asked us to look at their capital budget. Each year they get £6M from the government to invest in capital projects and they want us to determine their returns.\nThis year they invested 1/4 of the £6M in building maintenance, 1/2 in fixing the main courtyard – but actually when we dove into the costs we found that the majority of the courtyard money was spend advertising to people that they had fixed the main courtyard – and 1/4 on installing security cameras. Let’s look at the three projects one by one.\nExtra Information:\nThe building maintenance is fixed and hard to calculate a return on.\nThe additional advertising brought in an extra 10% of visitors. Each visitor brings in £3 in contributions from fees and £3 contribution from profits in the gift shop.\nThe security cameras is part of a 5 year project where the same amount of money will be invested each year. We expect that during the installation we will save £500K on security guards and after the project is complete we will save £1M per year on security guards.\nCandidate: 5 million visitors * 10% = 500K extra visitors, 500K extra visitors * £6/visitor = £3M additional revenues.\nI was told to assume that these extra visitors will not come back and that they will not tell their friends. So, the courtyard project has an expenditure of £3M, and brings in £3M additional revenue. Hence, it’s a zero NPV project.\nI also suggested looking at other ways to better spend their advertising money to increase their NPV. However, the interviewer told me that on the whole as museums will be stewarded towards maximizing the number of people that come through so this advertising investment makes some sense even if the NPV is negative.\nInterviewer: OK, now let’s look at the security cameras project.\nCandidate: During the building of the security cameras the net costs are:\nYear 1-5, £1.5M (capital expenditure) – £500K (savings on security guards) = £1M net costs\nThen from Year 6 onwards the museum saves £1M per year on security guards.\nAssumed a 10% cost of capital and a perpetuity for the savings, although stated that (a) the cameras will need annual maintenance and (b) they will need to be replaced every 10 – 20 years or so. However, it can approximate to a perpetuity of savings.\n\nPerpetuity of security guards savings is £1M/10% = £10M in year 6.\nPresent Value of savings (I had to estimate) is £6M\nPresent Value of net costs is (again estimates) at £4M\nThus, the net present value (NPV) is £2M.\n\nHence, the security cameras is a positive NPV project and should be encouraged. (actual NPV calculation is £1.8M)\nThen, the Interviewer said that all these capital investments are sunk costs and what we also needed to look at was future investment plans for the museum.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new business.\nConsulting Firm: Roland Berger Strategy Consultants first round job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: airlines.\nCase Interview Question #00780: The client Aeroflot – Russian Airlines, commonly known as Aeroflot, is the flag carrier and the largest airline of the Russian Federation. The carrier operates domestic and international passenger and services, mainly from its hub at Sheremetyevo International Airport in Moscow Oblast, Russia. Following the dissolution of the USSR, the carrier has been transformed from a state-run enterprise into a semi-privatised company which ranked 19th most profitable in the world in 2007.\nYou are working on a project for Aeroflot Airlines. Their current business model is purely focused on passengers, offering Economy, Business and First class travel. They have been relatively successful in recent years and have funds available to invest. The company’s CEO has asked you to investigate entering the global MRO (Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul) market for business aircraft. Is business jet MRO an attractive market to enter? Why or why not?\nPossible Answer:\nQuestion #1 – Interviewer: How would you go about structuring your analysis to this question?\nCandidate: First, I would need to understand what the MRO (Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul) business is about and establish the size of the market and its potential growth. To do this, I would (a) identify the different segments within the market, and (b) use price/volume analysis to determine their relative size. Then, knowing the dominant segment, or segments, I would investigate what the market growth drivers are.\nSecond, I would want to investigate the intensity of competition in the market as this would indicate what the likely market shares and margins for EuroCarrier would be. From this, I would also get a good understanding of some of the potential risks.\nAnalysis of market size, growth and competitiveness will help me assess the attractiveness of the market. If it is an attractive market, then I would need to think of potential means to enter the market. If the market is not attractive, I would want to offer the CEO some alternative options for consideration.\nInterviewer: Okay, this structure makes sense. What kind of products do you imagine are offered in the MRO segment?\nCandidate: Well, in terms of maintenance, I imagine they have to do an inspection of the plane before each flight, to check everything is okay. They would then have some kind of planned maintenance checks where they do a more detailed inspection. On the inside, they must maintain the seats and carpets pretty regularly. That’s the “M” covered. “R” for repairs would be when the plane has been damaged or has suffered wear and tear and needs fixing, and I guess “O” for overhaul has something to do with a complete refit of the aircraft.\nInterviewer: Yes, that’s most of the services offered. In industry terminology, there are three types of maintenance.\n\nLine maintenance, which involves pre-flight checks\nLight checks, which are inspections of major components every 4 months and\nHeavy checks, in-depth inspections of all components and systems, which happen every three years\n\nThe next major revenue stream within maintenance is called interiors. One product is deep-cleans, which is cleaning and repair of carpets, seats and so on. The second product is similar to what you described as overhaul, which involves reconfiguring the interior layout of the aircraft. How frequently do you think they would do these interiors operations?\nCandidate: I imagine a good proxy to use is that they would conduct a deep clean whenever a plane undergoes a light check, and likewise they would undertake a modification while the plane was having a heavy check. Since they would have to take the plane out of service to conduct these checks, they would want to do as much as possible concurrently, to minimise overall down-time.\nInterviewer: That’s a sensible assumption.\nCandidate: The next thing to consider is the different market segments. The size of the aircraft would be the major driver in determining the price of these services. So I would use three segments: large, medium and small.\nInterviewer: The large and medium aircraft are called widebody and narrowbody business liners respectively, while the small aircraft are called business jets. This table summarises the current numbers of these aircraft flying, together with the manufacturer (A, B, C…):\n\n\n\nNumber of aircraft in service\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nTotal\n\n\nBusiness Liner – Widebody\n9\n47\n0\n0\n0\n0\n56\n\n\nBusiness Liner Narrowbody\n23\n171\n0\n0\n0\n0\n194\n\n\nBusiness Jet\n0\n0\n1,548\n1,124\n96\n1,174\n3,942\n\n\nTotal\n32\n218\n1,548\n1,124\n96\n1,174\n4,192\n\n\n\nCandidate: The first thing that strikes me here is how numerically dominant the business jet is compared with the business liners. Assuming that you get four times as much revenue from the larger business liners, 80% of the market will still be from business jets. For that reason, I am going to focus on sizing the market for business jets.\nConsidering the maintenance and interiors services we discussed earlier, there are two drivers that I can think of. One is the labour charge and the second is the cost of materials. Are there any others?\nInterviewer: Well, there are obviously overhead costs to consider, but generally the client is billed for materials and labour, so these are good revenue drivers to assume. Before going further, let’s just consider line maintenance, which is conducted before each flight. If I said this isn’t likely to be a significant revenue stream, why might this be?\nCandidate: If it’s conducted before flight, then it will be done at whichever airport the aircraft is departing. Which means we’ll only ever get “line maintenance” revenue when an aircraft comes to the airport where our business is based.\nInterviewer: In fact, many business jets actually have an onboard engineer, who conducts the line maintenance himself, so there’s no need for an external provider.\nCandidate: So that means the market consists of “light checks” and “deep cleans” happening every four months, together with “heavy checks” and “modifications” happening every three years.\nStarting with labour prices, I would imagine you have to pay around USD 25 an hour for a trained aircraft engineer, then on top of this you’ll have to incorporate things like training costs, indirect staff costs, utilities, etc. into the charge out rate. Overall, you would bill about USD 100 per hour. Actually, thinking of the services we’re offering, for the deep clean you could probably use cheaper, lower skilled staff, so they would have a lower hourly rate.\nInterviewer: That’s true. Deep cleaning labour has a fully-burdened cost of USD 60 per hour, whereas it’s USD 120 for the other services. A light check requires 150 man-hours, a heavy check takes 1,200 manhours, a deep clean is 100 man-hours and a modification needs 1,000 man-hours.\nCandidate: A quick set of calculations will now work out the labour revenue for each of them:\nLight check: Labour rate x man-hours = 120 x 150 = USD 18,000\nHeavy check: Labour rate x man-hours = 120 x 1,200 = USD 144,000\nDeep clean: Labour rate x man-hours = 60 x 100 = USD 6,000\nModification: Labour rate x man-hours = 120 x 1,000 = USD 120,000\nOf course there is also the materials to consider. I imagine they’re a much more significant proportion of the revenue for heavy checks and modifications, where there would be lots of replacement parts. Whereas if you are doing a deep clean, the material needed are pretty insignificant.\nInterviewer: Okay, let’s ignore the material cost for deep cleaning. As an industry benchmark, material revenues are only a tenth of the overall revenue for light checks but half of the overall revenue for heavy checks and modifications.\nCandidate: So that means the materials represent USD 2,000 for a light check, USD 144,000 for each heavy check and USD 120,000 for every modification.\nHence the overall revenue for each type of service is:\nLight check: Labour revenue + materials revenue = 18,000 + 2,000 = USD 20,000\nHeavy check: Labour revenue + materials revenue = 144,000 + 144,000 = USD 288,000\nDeep clean: Labour revenue + materials revenue = 6,000 + 0 = USD 6,000\nModification: Labour revenue + materials revenue = 120,000 + 120,000 = USD 240,000\nThere are three light checks and deep cleans each year, and a third of a heavy check and modification in the average business jets year. Therefore the average annual MRO revenue is:\n[3 x (20,000 + 6,000)] + [1/3 x (288,000 + 240,000)] = USD 254,000\nOkay, so rounding the numbers, if we have 4,000 business jets, each with an annual MRO bill of USD 0.25 m, then the annual value of the business jet MRO market is around USD 1 billion.\nVery roughly speaking, if I use the previous assumption that a business liner generates 4 times as much revenue as a business jet given its larger size, that’s USD 1 m spent on MRO each per year, or USD 0.25 billion for all 250 aircraft. Hence the overall market for MRO on business aircraft is USD 1.25 billion.\nQuestion #2 – Interviewer: Now that we’ve established the market size, let’s consider its growth potential. What would you use as a proxy for business jet MRO demand growth?\nCandidate: Well, obviously demand growth for business jet MRO is going to be directly correlated to the demand for business jets. As business jets are generally used by senior individuals in companies and heads of state, I would imagine that GDP growth is a sensible proxy. This would indicate that demand will grow most strongly in regions such as Asia and the Middle East. However, I’ve also read that the number of high net worth individuals is increasing very rapidly. So maybe you need to put a multiplier on GDP to reflect this and get an accurate growth rate. Say somewhere between 1.5 and 2.5 times GDP.\nInterviewer: The actual forecast growth for business jet MRO demand is about 7%, so taking something in the middle at twice GDP growth will be equivalent to this. What specific factors might impact steady demand development?\nCandidate: In times of recession, you would expect there would be a lot more pressure on demand, particularly for corporate users who need to control costs. So demand would follow a more cyclical pattern over the periods of recession and growth. Of course, this is all volume demand. Price development will be affected by the competitive intensity of the market.\nQuestion #3 – Interviewer: Now seems a sensible time to assess the competitive intensity of the market then. There are currently five major MRO providers, each with a 20% market share.\nCandidate: Well, the industry seems pretty fragmented, with no real dominant company. This implies that the market place will be relatively competitive, putting some pressure on prices and therefore margins.\nAs for the customers, I imagine there are some companies that have a fleet of business jets that they charter out. If this is a sizeable operation, then they may already have internal MRO operations. Of course some business jets may be tied to long term contracts with existing MRO providers. However, I think the majority of customers would be open to using any MRO provider that offers the correct level of service, reliability and quality at the necessary pricing point.\nWithin the market, I can’t really imagine any direct substitutes and suppliers are likely to offer parts at a fixed aftermarket price. In addition, there are pretty high barriers to entry. You would need hanger facilities at an airport, highly trained personnel and a significant pool of spare parts, which would collectively require a lot of investment. So all these factors make this an attractive market to be established in, if you are able to overcome these barriers to entry.\nTo conclude, at an annual value of USD 1.25 billion and 7% volume growth rate, the business jet MRO market seems worthy of entry. The competitive situation indicates there will be no dominant player. However, with the high volume growth, you could rapidly improve market share organically. I would therefore recommend entering this market to the CEO.\nQuestion #4 – Interviewer: So, we’ve decided that this is a good market to enter. What are the potential entry methods available?\nCandidate: Well, they could use the funds to set up their own business from scratch, or they could acquire an existing business. They could also form some kind of joint venture.\nInterviewer: What kind of companies might they form a joint venture with?\nCandidate: The obvious choice would be with an existing MRO provider. They could use the funds to expand existing operations, product offering or geographic location. However, another option would be to form a joint venture with a business jet operator that already has a maintenance facility and is looking to expand. This would provide an initial captive market base for the business, guaranteeing an initial source of revenues. The downside of this is that margins are likely to be lower with the joint venture partner, due to the greater transparency they have on your costs.\nInterviewer: Previously you mentioned either setting up or acquiring a business. What are the advantages and disadvantages of these options?\nCandidate: Setting up a business offers the highest risks and returns. You start with no technical skills in the sector, need to establish a base of operations and acquire market share from competitors. But you do get to keep 100% of your profits. If EuroCarrier has existing maintenance facilities, these could be used.\nWith acquiring, you already have an existing operation with existing customers. However here the issue is that there might not be any suitable companies available for acquisition, and even if there are, you need to ensure that you are not overpaying for them.\nInterviewer: So if you had to recommend one of these options to the CEO, which would it be?\nCandidate: I think I would go with one of the joint venture options – the one with an existing business jet operator. Here there is already an existing customer and skill base, so that right from the beginning the focus can be on expansion, rather than worrying about things such as gaining technical skills and setting up a base of operations. Unlike acquiring a company, there will be fewer issues with valuation, loss of senior management and integration. In addition, from the perspective of mitigating risk, a joint venture offers an easier exit route from the market, if and when required.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: business turnaround.\nConsulting Firm: Roland Berger Strategy Consultants first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: healthcare: hospital & medical.\nCase Interview Question #00779: Lexington is a mid-size city in Kentucky, United States. In the 2014 U.S. Census Estimate, the city’s population was 310,797, anchoring a metropolitan area of 489,435 people and a combined statistical area of 708,677 people. For this case, our client Saint Joseph Hospital is a 350-bed hospital located 2 miles southwest of Downtown Lexington, Kentucky.\nThe organization Saint Joseph Hospital has historically exhibited strong financial performance, and had a 1-3% operating gain each year for the last five years. However, they are projecting a $12 million operating loss this year, and expect this situation to worsen in the future. As a result, the CFO of Saint Joseph Hospital believes that they will be out of cash within five years. They have asked us to identify the source of this sudden downturn, and to come up with alternatives to restore them to a break-even position. They are one of the largest employers in the State of Kentucky, and will not consider layoffs as a possible solution. How would you go about helping the client to restore profitability?\nPossible Answer:\nThis case addresses company profitability. The interviewer is looking for a candidate’s business intuition and ability to apply this intuition to identify potential sources of the problem. In addition, the interviewer is looking for potential solutions to the client’s profitability problem.\nCandidate: Profitability is a function of an organization’s revenues and costs. The first thing I’d like to focus on is the hospital’s future revenue stream. As I understand the hospital industry, revenues may be fixed for several years due to long-term contracts with insurers. Is this the case for this particular hospital?\nInterviewer: Your intuition is correct. Revenues have dropped approximately 15% so far this year due to aggressive pricing on capitated managed care contracts that were signed in January and declining admissions and length of stay for their fee-for-service contracts, most of which are still reimbursed on a per diem basis. All contracts are binding for three years, and cannot be renegotiated.\nCandidate: In that case, it is important to understand the company’s cost structure to see if it can adjust to this declining stream of revenue. Does the client have considerable fixed costs that will be difficult to reduce in the near term?\nInterviewer: Hospital occupancy is approximately 70%, resulting in high fixed costs that are not covered by the current contribution margin. The organization is currently staffed for 80% occupancy.\nCandidate: Since revenue is declining at a fixed rate and fixed costs are high in the short-term, the hospital will have to analyze its variable cost structure. I would surmise that staffing costs are the main source of variable costs. However, the hospital cannot address this due to its policy concerning layoffs. I would think that the other main driver of variable costs for the hospital lies in its utilization of resources. Am I headed down the right track?\nInterviewer: In fact, you’re right. The utilization of diagnostic and therapeutic services during a patient’s stay is approximately 15% higher than what was expected when contract pricing was negotiated.\nCandidate: Given that information, the hospital should focus on changing physician behavior since physicians ultimately control the utilization of resources. The hospital may want to align MD incentives with those of the hospital by sharing risk, giving physicians data and education on their use of resources versus the competition. Other ways to reduce expenses could be to sign exclusive contracts with a distributor in order to generate volume discounts and economies in purchasing, or by reducing choice by limiting the pharmacy formulary to generics and decreasing the number of vendors utilized for high volume items such as prosthetics and heart catheters.\nInterviewer: That’s a good discussion of cost implications, but have you given up on recommending ways to increase hospital revenue?\nCandidate: Now that you mention it, the situation is not hopeless in this regard. The hospital may want to increase revenue by signing contracts with additional insurers, by putting salaried physicians on staff to guarantee that they admit to our client’s hospital, or by creating an affiliated physician organization to increase their share of admissions. In addition, they can potentially leverage their distinctive competencies by developing Centers of Excellence that can be marketed to managed care contractors as an exclusive provider for those services within the region, and possibly outside the region.\nInterviewer: Are there any other solutions that may be feasible?\nCandidate: One final thought that keeps coming back to me centers on the company’s current competitors. What does the local market look like?\nInterviewer: There are two other 350-bed hospitals in the city of Lexington. One is an academic medical center, the other a catholic hospital recently acquired by a for-profit chain. Additionally, total admissions in the marketplace have dropped by 5% and total patient days have declined 10%.\nCandidate: In that case the client may want to consider affiliating with a competitor in the market. This may help to decrease capacity across the city by rationalizing the services offered at each institution. This may allow one hospital to close, thereby reducing fixed costs.\nInterviewer: Very good, thank you!\nGeneral Summary Comments\nThe candidate should fully address the components of this issue (profit = revenue – costs) and should be able to demonstrate an understanding of fixed vs. variable costs. Moreover, the candidate should be able to brainstorm possible solutions to the problem, both from a revenue maximization and cost minimization perspective.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: organizational behavior; operations strategy & optimization.\nConsulting Firm: Boston Consulting Group (BCG) first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: financial services.\nCase Interview Question #00823: Your client Two Sigma Investments is a New York City-based hedge fund that uses a variety of technological methods, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, and distributed computing, for its trading strategies. The firm is run by John Overdeck and David Siegel, and has $32 billion assets under management (AUM). The company’s main office is in New York City. It also has branch offices in Houston, London, and Hong Kong.\nPreviously the hedge fund selected investments based on a complex mathematical model. However, about 2 years ago they started seeing lower returns. To address this problem they added a research team to help evaluate investments. If the mathematical model recommends an investment, then money is invested. If the model and the research analysts agree on an investment, then a larger percentage is invested than if only the model recommends the investment.\nThe research team of Two Sigma Investments currently consists of 4 Senior Analysts and 3 Junior Analysts. The CEO is extremely pleased with the new research team and the uplift in returns they have seen as a result of the new investment methodology. However, he does not feel that the research team is properly structured and has asked you to advise him on re-structuring the team. What issues would you consider and how would you structure the team?\nAdditional Information: to be provided after relevant questions \n• The overall goal of the hedge fund is to maximize returns and they tolerate a high amount of risk.\n• Individual investors invest between $20M-$100M.\n• All seven research analysts currently report to the head of trading.\n• When the trading department has a question on an investment, the head of trading will contact one of the Senior Analysts and ask him/her to evaluate an investment. The Senior Analyst will then prioritize the request and divide it between him/herself and the Junior Analysts.\n• Investment research (even an individual request) can usually be broken into several discrete pieces.\n• The CEO does not want to fire anyone.\nPossible Answer:\nSuggested Framework:\n• Considerations\n• How to compensate\n• Reporting lines\n• Appropriate leverage\nAfter a brief discussion of compensation/rewards and reporting lines, the interviewer directed me to the issue of leverage. Upon asking if the research work could be broken up between Junior and Senior Analysts he provided the following data:\n• Both Junior and Senior analysts feel that they are doing work that is beneath them.\n• If investment research work was pushed down to the lowest competent level, the work could be divided as follows:\n\n\n\n\nSenior Analysts\nJunior Analysts\nResearch Assistants\n\n\nData Gathering\n25%\n25%\n50%\n\n\nAnalysis\n20%\n80%\n0%\n\n\nSynthesis\n80%\n20%\n0%\n\n\n\nIf there is 100 hours of research work to do, it would be broken up as follows:\nData Gathering: 20%\nAnalysis: 60%\nSynthesis: 20%\nUsing data provided on work allocation, I calculated how many of each level of research worker would provide appropriate leverage to the senior analysts.\nIf a research project takes 100 hours it would be broken down between (in hours):\n\n\n\n\ntotal time\nSenior Analyst\nJunior Analyst\nResearch Assistant\n\n\nData Gathering\n20\n5\n5\n10\n\n\nAnalysis\n60\n12\n48\n0\n\n\nSynthesis\n20\n16\n4\n0\n\n\nTotal Hours\n100\n33\n57\n10\n\n\n\nTherefore, one Senior Analyst should have roughly two Junior Analysts and one Research Assistant can be shared between 3 Senior Analysts.\nBased on the 4 Senior Analysts our client currently has, they should create the following organizational structure.\n\nThere are currently 3 Junior Analysts. Since the CEO does not want to fire anyone, the client Two Sigma should hire 5 more Junior Analysts for their research team.\nThe following additional implications/points provide additional insight:\n• There will be additional capacity issue for the research assistants; however, because they are the cheapest resources you do not want them to be the bottleneck.\n• There should be little resistance by any involved parties. While the Junior Analysts will no longer report directly to the Trading Head, they will no longer be doing work that is “beneath them” and will have a manager trained in their field.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Encouraged by the recent technology and Internet startups boom, and also, to make the world a better place, the client has just founded a startup company together with two business school classmates. Their business plan is very simple: to start an online ice cream delivery shop.\nSimilar to other online food ordering companies like GrubHub, Seamless, Delivery Hero, Just-Eat, FoodPanda, etc, the client’s startup works like this: They will buy an ice cream store first, then build a website which would list different kinds of ice cream they sell, as well as menus from local ice cream shops. The users would then use the website to place orders online. The client would then be responsible for arranging the ice cream delivery, either from the client’s own store or from local ice cream shops. The client would generate revenues by charging a small commission fee to ice cream shops for every customer order from their website.\nIs this a good idea? Why or why not?\nPossible Answer:\nQuestion 1: What factors should you consider with this type of business?\nSuggested Solution:\n1. Internal Factors/ Value Chain\na. Supplier Types\n\nLocal ice cream shops\nThird party bulk ice cream distributors (wholesalers)\nBuy ice cream at store and store in freezer for internally controlled distribution\n\nb. Distribution\n\nRely on local shops (similar to online florists)\nIn company owned freezer trucks\n\n2. External factors/ Market\na. Advertising\n\nWhere to advertise?

Seasonality\n\nCan you achieve sales year round or only during hotter months\nChanging ice cream flavors, and therefore inventory, for the time of the year.\n\nQuestion 2: Estimate the market size (in $) in the United States for online ice cream delivery (averaged over the year).\nSuggested Solution:\n1. Determine the population of the country (To be provided if asked: approximately 300 million)\n2. Calculate the portion of population that eats ice cream\n\nThere area many types of ice cream and it is a popular food item\nRoughly half of the population eats ice cream regularly, and it is evenly distributed across income, age, and gender\n50% * 300M = 150 million\n\n3. Find the part of population that would be willing to order ice cream online\n\n20-30 year old population is more likely to order online, especially for gifts\nAverage life expectancy is around 80 years, so percentage of population in the target age range would be (30-20)/80 = 12.5%\n12.5% * 150M = 18.75 million\nPercentage of this age group population that would order online is 20%\n20% * 18.75M = 3.75 million\nTo simplify calculation, let’s say 4 million\n\n4. Estimate the average size of the order (price per order) to find the total market size (note: exact numbers are not important, provide them if asked)\n\nCustomers are likely to order larger quantities if ordering online due to delivery costs\nAverage price of ice cream is around $3  per pint (to be provided if asked)\nAverage online order is 2 pints, giving an average order of $6\nAverage person orders once or twice a year\n4 million * $6 * 2 = $48 million\n\nQuestion 3: Is this an attractive business?\nSuggested Solution:\nThe short answer is no. Main reasons are:\n\nMarket size is too small: only $48 million in total addressable market\nBusiness model still unproved: will people really order ice cream online?\nCompetition from other brick and mortar ice cream shops.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Yammer is used for private communication within organizations and is an example of enterprise social software. The tool was originally developed as an internal communication system for the genealogy website Geni. Access to a Yammer network is determined by a user’s Internet domain so that only individuals with appropriate email addresses may join their respective networks.\nThe year is 2012. Technology giant Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) is looking to buy out Yammer. At this time, Yammer is already profitable and is expected to have steady, continued growth for the foreseeable future. The CEO of Yammer has offered to sell for $1.2 Billion. Is this a reasonable price for Microsoft?\nPossible Answer:\nQuestion 1: What are some of the methods for valuing the acquisition target Yammer? \nSuggested Solution:\n\nDiscounted Cash Flow (DCF)\nComparables / multiples from similar companies.\nMultiples such as price to earnings ratio, price to sales, assuming that information is available.\n\nQuestion 2: Using a simple DCF valuation method, is an acquisition price of $1.2 Billion a good deal?\nAdditional Information: (to be provided to the candidate if aksed)\n\nDiscount Rate (WACC, weighted average cost of capital): 11%\nGrowth Rate: 3%\nYearly Cash Flow (for foreseeable future): $50 million\n\nSuggested Solution:\n1.

ICL serves primarily three markets: agriculture, food and engineered materials. ICL produces approximately a third of the world’s bromine, and is the world’s sixth largest potash producer. It is a manufacturer of specialty fertilizers and specialty phosphates, flame retardants and water treatment solutions.\nThe client ICL needs some capital to build a new factory in Tel-Aviv, Israel. Demand for their specialty fertilizer products is increasingly high and this new factory will allow them to meet this demand. Your consulting firm has been retained by  the CEO of ICL to advise them on their options of raising new capital. What would you recommend?\nPossible Answer:\nQuestion 1: What are the potential funding options for the client?\nSuggested Solution:\n\nEquity (issue stock/shares)\nShort term or long term debt\nHybrids like debt convertible to equity (CoCo bonds, Contingent Convertibles)\n\nQuestion 2: Given the information below, what is the most attractive funding option for the client and why?\nAdditional Information: (to be provided to the candidate if aksed)\nDebt (Currently 70%)\n\nShort term loan: 3% with cash payments of $7 million per year.\nLong term loan: 6% with cash payments of $2 million per year.\nGetting the loan will increase percentage of debt to 75%.\n\nEquity (Currently 30%)\n\nCurrent Return on Equity is low compared to the industry.\nGetting new equity will increase the percentage of equity to 42%.\n\nSuggested Solution:\nReturn on Equity:\n\nReturn on Assets: likely to stay the same – while the new factory will increase the assets, ICL will also sell more, increasing sales.\nLeverage: If the client ICL obtains a loan for financing, this will increase.\n\nDue to the low return on equity, a loan seems like a better idea, although the client ICL is pretty highly leveraged already. Since the capital is for a long term asset (building a new factory), then the loan should also be long term. A long term loan should also help ICL meet their interest payments as the payment amounts will be lower. (In fact, as of April 2009, the company was said to be considering a bond offering to raise $122 million.)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

In the last few years National Semiconductor has been leading the introduction of automotive high-tech electronics including satellite navigation systems, vehicle systems monitoring, climate control and passenger comfort systems, etc.\nThe recent surge in demand for its products and the wave of new products under development requires additional manufacturing capability. Your consulting firm has been engaged to help the client determine how best to deploy additional capacity  in one of its manufacturing facilities – FAB ALPHA23.\nHow would you begin to analyze the problem?\nPossible Answer:\nThe candidate should first ask some clarification questions about the manufacturing process:\n\nWhat is the current manufacturing process and what are the key equipment in the process flow?\nWhich equipment are the bottlenecks?\n\nThe candidate should put down a structure initially addressing the following questions. Possible high level structure could be:\na. Capacity Constraints\n\nWhat is the current throughput and how much additional throughput do we need to plan for?\nCan we increase throughput without new investments (i.e. by improving our operational effectiveness)?\nCompetition capacity (probably acquire a company).\n\nb. Demand\n\nIs it a short burst in demand or is it sustainable? What are the main drivers for this demand?\nWhat is the market size & growth rate – how much are we planning to capture, i.e. how did we arrive at the new throughput requirements?\n\nc. Return on Investment\n\nDo we want to build the unit in U.S./India/China?

Hence the product mix will determine the actual capacity constraints.\nCurrent throughput of the fab is 5000 wafers/month. The plan is to ramp up by 20% by the end of this quarter.\n\nExhibit A: Semiconductor manufacturing process overview\n\nThe candidate should note that a quick scan of the process flow in Exhibit A indicates more arrows leading to Photolithography (Photo) than any other processing stage.\nAt the current levels of utilization:\n\nDiffusion has 5 machines, each capable of processing 1200 wafers / month.\nEtch has 6 machines, each capable of processing 1000 wafers / month.\nPhoto has 10 machines, each processing 500 wafers / month.\nAll other stages have enough capacity to process 10,000 wafers /month.\n\nIf the candidate has not already pointed this out, the candidate should use the numbers to indicate that the bottleneck for our capacity ramp up is the ‘Photo’ stage of production, otherwise to confirm it.\nIn addition, the following financial data is available:\n\n1 Photo machine costs $1,200,000. It is depreciated over 5 years (straight line).\nEach additional wafer/month adds $45 in revenues and $30 in direct costs.\n\nThe candidate should calculate the following:\n\nAnnual depreciation of Photo Machine: $1,200,000/5 = $240K\nProfit from additional throughput: $45 – $30 = $15 per wafer per month\nAdditional profitability from the increased throughput (1000 wafers/month), without new equipment: $15*1000*12 = $180K\nWith the new equipment annual profitability change is $180K – $240K = -$60K\n\nTherefore, it does not make sense to invest in a new photo machine for the desired level of output increase.\nInterviewer: Ask the candidate at what level of output increase does it make sense.\nThe candidate should calculate the following:\n\nThe new Photo equipment purchase at current utilization levels can be justified for a demand increase of $240k/($15*12) = 1334 wafers / month.\nAlso, the candidate should ask if it is possible to increase sales to this level – the answer is no.\n\nInterviewer: At this point, ask the candidate what else the client company can do.\nThe candidate should realize that the maximum throughput data was on the current level of utilization and should ask what the current capacity utilization is.\nAll equipment at the fab are running at sub-par utilization. Current equipment utilization levels are as low as 50%.\nThe candidate should ask why utilization is so low.\nThe key causes of under-utilization are shown in Exhibit B.\nExhibit B: Causes of under-utilization\n\nThe candidate should draw the following inferences:\n\nUnplanned maintenance, idle time of operators and other losses account for 28% of the total time. Therefore, through better planning the utilization can be improved.\nWhile utilization lost to preventative maintenance and speed losses is harder to reduce, the other areas should be easier to improve. Therefore, a 10% improvement in utilization seems quite conservative.\nTo increase the throughput from 5000 wafers/month to 6000 wafer/ month on the same set of equipment we need to increase equipment utilization level from the current 50% to (50% * 6000/5000) = 60%, this represents a 10% improvement in utilization.\n\nConclusion: The client National Semiconductor should invest in improving equipment effectiveness through better planning.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new business;  operations strategy.\nConsulting Firm: Bain & Company second round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: sports, leisure & recreation.\nCase Interview Question #00810 Cheyenne is the capital and most populous city of the US state of Wyoming, with a population of about 60,000 according tothe 2010 census. Mountaintop Ski Resort is a premier ski resort located outside of Cheyenne, Wyoming. It is one of the most popular ski locations for people in the  Cheyenne Metropolitan Area.\nSnowboarding is a recreational activity that involves descending a slope that is covered with snow while standing on a snowboard attached to a rider’s feet. Snowboarding has been banned at Mountaintop Ski Resort since 1990 (just when snowboarding was starting to gain popularity) on the grounds that snowboarders represented an “undesirable element” and Mountaintop was better off just catering to skiers. However, as Mountaintop prepares for a new season they ask themselves, as they do every year, if they should lift the ban on snowboarders. This question seems especially relevant this year since Mountaintop’s growth has stagnated in the past two years after a decade of robust growth (see Graph A).\nYou and your case team have been asked to help the management of Mountaintop Ski Resort determine the best course of action. What would you do? \nGraph A: Skiers per season (15 weeks) at Mountaintop Ski Resort\n\nPossible Answer:\nThis is a typical Bain-style strategy case which presents a case up-front and then asks the interviewee to work out the best solution.\nCandidate: I would like to understand more about the Mountaintop Ski Resort business in terms of what the customers look for, what Mountaintop offers and its competitive positioning and finally, if possible, do a quantitative comparison of the impact of allowing snowboarders vs. enforcing the ban.\nAdditional Information: Give this information as it is asked\n1. Customers\nBased on customer surveys the most important things to skiers (ranked from most important to least) are:\n\nthe price of the ticket;\nthe amount of time one has to wait in the lift lines; and\nthe presence of ancillary amenities like restaurants on the mountain, ski schools for kids, and ski rental shops (see Graph B).\n\nGraph B: Factors important in choosing Mountaintop\n\n2. Company\n\nMountaintop Ski Resort is undeniably the better mountain for skiing. If the prices were the same and there wasn’t the ban on snowboarders, everyone would go to Mountaintop. If Mountaintop reduced the price difference to less than $20, some skiers would want to go to Mountaintop.\nThree years ago Mountaintop upgraded its lifts to high-speed, four-seat lifts (this is the peak of technology). This increased the mountain’s capacity from 1500 skiers per day to 2000 skiers per day.\nBased on Mountaintop’s strategy it appeals to higher-end customers, mostly from Cheyenne or out-of-town. As such, it is busiest on the weekends where they average about 2000 skiers (which is the mountain’s full capacity) per day, but attendance drops to an average of 300 skiers during the week. This is likely due to the fact that this higher-end clientele works during the week and can only ski during the weekend (see Graph C).\n\nGraph C: Average skiers per day at Mountaintop vs. Shredsville\n\n3. Competition\n\nThere is one other ski resort in the Cheyenne area, Shredsville. Shredsville is Mountaintop’s only competition (some skiers come in from beyond Cheyenne but we will assume that any actions that Mountaintop takes will neither increase or decrease that out-of-town population which comes to Cheyenne to ski).\nA lift ticket at Mountaintop is $50 while a lift ticket at Shredsville costs $30.\nShredsville is barely profitable right now. It is unlikely that it would be able to lower the prices of its lift tickets.\nShredsville has an average of 600 skiers per day for every day of the week. This is likely based on Shredsville having a less-affluent clientele (a bunch of teenagers and twenty-somethings who just want to be ski bums). Additionally, snowboarders tend to be less-affluent and younger people.\nShredsville is 60% snowboarders.\n\nThe first key insight is that skiers really don’t mind sharing the mountain with snowboarders; however, they do not want to have a more crowded mountain. As such, the mere presence of snowboarders would not drive many regular skiers away.\nSecond, the Mountaintop Ski Resort cannot expand anymore since it already has the fastest lifts available. This makes Mountaintop’s maximum capacity 2000 per day. However, it only has 300 skiers on the weekdays so it can grow by increasing the number of people who ski during the week. The key is determining how to increase the number of weekday skiers without hurting the weekend revenue.\nThird, a ski resort has relatively large fixed costs. As such the incremental cost of an additional skier is minimal. Anything Mountaintop can do to increase the number of skiers that come during the week would flow straight to the bottom line.\nSimply lifting the ban on snowboarders would not have maximum impact. Since Mountaintop costs more, it appeals to the weekend and vacationing skiers (Graph C). Plus it is probably pretty reasonable that snowboarding appeals to a younger, less-affluent demographic. There would certainly be some snowboarders who would come over during the week like vacationers, but not many; most of the snowboarders who would come to Mountaintop during the weekend when it is already at capacity.\nThe best solution might be to lift the ban and then have a tiered pricing approach based on the day of the week. The increased demand during the weekend would allow Mountaintop to raise its weekend prices. Simple microeconomics would tell at what price would allow an equilibrium with 2000 skiers.\nDuring the week, Mountaintop could lower its prices to entice both skiers and snowboarders who ski at Shredsville because of the price differential (reason 3 says that Shredsville cannot respond to lower prices at Mountaintop with its own lower prices) to start skiing at Mountaintop. Again microeconomics would tell how many additional skiers Mountaintop would get if it lowered its weekday price by a certain amount. Since the costs will not be affected by these strategies, the break-even analysis will simply be based on revenue—How much can you raise ticket prices on the weekend before you drive skiers away, and how low can you bring the price of tickets during the week so the loss in ticket prices is made up by increased revenue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new product, new technology.\nConsulting Firm: IBM Global Business Services (GBS)  first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: software, information technology (IT).\nCase Interview Question #00811: Our client Motorola Mobility LLC is a division of Lenovo Group that develops mobile devices. Headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, United States, the company was formed in January, 2011 by the split of Motorola Inc. into two separate companies: Motorola Mobility took on the company’s consumer-oriented product lines, including its mobile phone business, while Motorola Solutions retained the company’s enterprise-oriented product lines.\nThe company primarily manufactures smartphones and other mobile devices running the Android operating system. As a leading electronic component manufacturer in the U.S., Motorola Mobility has recently developed a revolutionary new bar code laser scanner, which is compatible with all mobile phones. The CEO of Motorola Mobility had started development of this new technology about 2 years ago that will allow people to comparison shop with their cell phones. The technology works by waving the cell phone – with a scanner attached to it – over the UPC bar code of a product in any store. The cell phone responds by displaying detailed product information and lists the closest shops to buy the product and the price at each retailer.\nThe CEO now feels that apart from this there may be other applications compatible with this new technology and wants you to assess the potential of this technology. He would like you tell him about the economics of launching this new product. Let’s talk first about the product being only launched for comparison-shopping.\nPossible Answer: \n1. Suggested Structure\nSince this is a “launching a new product” type of case, the candidate should first analyze the attractiveness of the market for this scanning device: its overall market size, consumer purchasing behavior, growth, possibility of competition entering the market and barriers to entry.\nIf the market looks attractive, he/she should then assess the economics of the product launch like the investment required, the sources of capital and the cash flows expected from the business based on the required rate of return from the investment.\nOnce the required cash flows are ascertained, the candidate should go back to the market views and see if these cash flows are likely to materialize.\nBonus point: this new product may face legal issues through laws which cover snooping and competitive intelligence at stores. Solution to this is that this is part of the cell phone and would be covered in the agreement with the cellular service provider.\n2. Market Sizing\nTotal number of cell phone subscribers in the U.S. = 300 million\nInterviewer: Ask the candidate how he/she would further segment this market to arrive at the potential number of subscribers for this new technology.\nConsumer buying behavior:\n\nNumber of mobile phone subscribers using value-added services like SMS, email, data interchange = 80%\n\nInterviewer: Let the candidate ask if there is any survey or study.\nSurvey carried out by cellular companies’ shows that there are normally 1/10 of these 80% subscribers, which start using any new value-added service in the first year of the launch.\nHence the total potential market = 8% of 300 million = 24 million users\n3. Cost-Benefits Analysis\nCosts:\n\nDevelopment and integration costs = $20 million (fixed)\nManufacturing costs per scanner = $70 (variable)\nCellular operator network charges = $1 per subscriber per month\nSG&A = $2 per subscriber per month\n\nRevenues:\n\nSelling price of scanner = $50 (subsidized)\nFlat monthly charge = $2 per subscriber per month\n\nInterviewer: At this point ask the candidate whether any other revenue stream is likely. If the candidate mentions revenues from the recommended stores, you can tell him/her that the client company has signed a 5 year contract with shopping.com which provides them access to their database of 1200 stores and shopping.com has agreed to pay the company for referring customers to its network of stores and for consumer data related to these purchases or queries. Monthly revenue from stores in the network = $4 per subscriber per month.\nTherefore, total revenues = $4 + $2 = $6 per subscriber per month\nBreak-even volume:\n\nBEV = Fixed costs / Unit contribution margin\nFixed costs = $10 million\nUnit contribution margin (annual) = Revenues – Variable costs – Subsidy for the scanner = ($6 * 12 months – $3 * 12 months – $20) = $16\nBEV = $20 million / $16 = 1.25 million subscribers\n\nThe candidate should go back to the market size of 24 million and comment that the Break-even volume required for the project seems likely as the client company would break-even at 1.25/24 = 5.2% market size which seems possible.\nInterviewer: Ask the candidate a trick question, like what would be the NPV of the project, if the company manages to have the break-even subscription volume and if the discount rate of capital is 20%.\nAt break-even volume, net present value = 0.\n4. Recommendation\nWhile summarizing the above, the candidate should highlight the salient features and risks associated with the project.\nSalient Features:\n\nGreat value added technology, useful to the savvy shopper and also to the shopper who is willing to spend time for good deals.\nAdded benefit of knowing more information about a product without relying on sales people in the shops.\nGrowth in value added cellular services would go up with time and possibility of adding on other scanning services like mail order catalogues from magazine advertisements.\n\nRisks:\n\nThis technology is not patented and healthy margins may invite competition in the sector along with threat of forward integration by the cellular operators, so it’s important to lock-in exclusive contracts with the cellular operators.\nRapidly changing technology – could be phased out.\nInherent high risk associated with large capital in technology- intensive project.\nLegal risks as pointed out earlier.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

SAP is headquartered in Walldorf, Baden-Württemberg, Germany, with regional offices in 130 countries. The company has over 293,500 customers in 190 countries.\nAs one of the largest publicly traded software services companies (NYSE: SAP), SAP’s current portfolio is comprised of four major product groups: Universal Desktop Software (UDS), Productivity Pack (PP), Business Infrastructure Suite (BIS), and Business Solutions Suite (BSS). It has been facing slowing growth and lagging stock performance lately. Its international business is growing well, however its U.S. operations have been lagging, even though the U.S. business represent over a third of its total sales. 10% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) up to fiscal year 2011 has slowed now to 3% CAGR since then.

Past History\nIn the past, SAP had all but shunned the small business market in favor of the larger enterprise segment.\ne. Competition\nThe large business segment is highly competitive with intense competition from large software and hardware vendors.\nPossible Answer:\nThere are a number of ways that the interviewee could potentially segment the market. Look for a logical segmentation structure with clearly defined segmentation variables (e.g. vertical markets, business versus consumer, geographies, buying behaviors)\nThe interviewee should ask for the data related to the revenue growth projections associated with each of the two business segments.\nThe candidate should be able to see that small businesses are a better target for SAP.\nQuestion #3: Is there a way SAP can prioritize which small businesses to go after?\nAdditional Information on industries and IT spend: to be provided during the course of the interview\n\n\n\nIndustry\n# of businesses\nIT spend ($ billions)\n\n\nAgriculture\n967\n$1.1B\n\n\nManufacturing\n483\n$7.3B\n\n\nTelecom and Utilities\n69\n$3.3B\n\n\nBusiness Services\n1,538\n$7.6B\n\n\n\nPossible Answer:\nIt makes most sense to concentrate on industries which have the largest spend per business (e.g. Telecom). Agriculture will probably be last in this case.\nQuestion #4: What is your recommendation for SAP? (Summarize your findings)\nPossible Answer:\n\nSAP has traditionally used a product based view of the market as opposed to a customer segment based view.\nThe interviewee should provide a clear recommendation for focusing on the small business segment.\nThe interviewee should provide confident and concise recommendations on why the small business segment is more attractive (e.g. high growth rates, less competitive segment, historically has not been an area of focus).\nWithin the small business segment, SAP should prioritize its strategy on certain industry verticals like telecom.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The company was founded in 2003 as a mobile game development studio named Relude, and was renamed to Rovio Mobile in 2005.\nThe year is 2009. Our client Rovio Entertainment has recently developed a simple, yet addictive puzzle game for mobile devices called “Angry Birds”. In the game, players use a slingshot to launch birds at pigs stationed in or around various structures with the goal of destroying all the pigs on the playing field. As players advance through the game new types of birds become available, some with special abilities that can be activated by the player. The Angry Birds game reached No. 1 spot in the Apple App Store paid apps chart after six months, and remained charted for months after.\nAngry Birds is the 52nd game released by the client Rovio. Rovio is considering how to maximize their revenues from Angry Birds in the next few years. Mobile video games tend to have short life cycles. A game receives the vast majority of its revenues within the first  year of release. What would you recommend to the client in order to maximize their revenues from Angry Birds?\nPossible Answer: \nQuestion 1: There are several types of business models for mobile games. Considering the brief descriptions of each model below, can you list the pros and cons of adopting each model?\n\nTraditional: charge a one-time fee for players to download onto their mobile device.\nFree-to-Play: free for players to download, pay for micro-transactions (small payments) for extra lives, special items, etc.\nFreemium /Advertising-Based: free for players to download, displays advertising in game.\nSubscription: free for players to download, pay monthly fee to continue to play (subscription usually starts after first month)\n\nSuggested Solution:\n\n\n\nModel\nPros\nCons\n\n\nTraditional\n\n\nUpfront revenue does not depend on how long players continue to play after buying.\nMore reliable sales forecasts.\nPossibility to change model if sales are lower than forecast.\n\n\n\n\nRevenue tends come only at the beginning of the product cycle.\nLess players will download due to upfront cost.\n\n\n\n\nFree-to-play\n\n\nFree game leads to more downloads and potentially micro-transactions.\nHighest revenue potential if game is a hit, as players get addicted to buying content.\n\n\n\n\nPlayers will look for ways around paying for content even if they enjoy the game.\nHard to get the balance between useful in game items for sale and frustrating players by forcing them to buy items.\n\n\n\n\nFreemium\n\n\nFree game leads to more downloads.\nAdvertising provides a steady stream of income if players are retained.\n\n\n\n\nPlayers do not like advertising.\nMust focus on getting advertisers as well as players.\nHigh need for retention means continuous teasers required to entice players to remain (higher costs).\n\n\n\n\nSubscription\n\n\nPlayers like ad-free content and lower upfront cost.\nSteady income stream from subscription.\n\n\n\n\nHigher drop-off rates as players do continue to pay if they are not playing regularly.\nNeed to have discounts/free trial periods at the beginning which decreases revenues (revenue leakage).\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2: What metrics could be used to help estimate revenues for these models?\nSuggested Solution:\n\n\n\nModel\nMetrics\n\n\nAll\n\n\nNumber of downloads;\nPlayer drop-off rate\n\n\n\n\nTraditional\nPrice of a download\n\n\nFree-to-play\n\n\nAverage number of micro-transactions per player;\nAverage price per mico-transaction\n\n\n\n\nFreemium\nRevenue from advertisers (cost per view? Cost per click?)\n\n\nSubscription\n\n\nCost of subscription – monthly? Discounts for longer periods?\nAverage length of subscription per player;\nNumber of players that buy subscription after trying game.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3: The client Rovio has estimates for downloads and pricing strategies for each business model. Calculate the potential revenues for each option and suggest the most attractive option for the client.\na. Traditional\n\nDownloads: 15 million.\nPrice: $2.99\n\nb. Free-to-play\n\nDownloads: 30 million within first month\nPrice/Micro-transaction: $0.99\nThe first month has the most downloads, then the number of players using the game drops steadily and consistently over a year.\nLight Players (10% of players): Buy an average 1 item/month\nHeavy Players (1% of players): Buy an average 10 items/month\nIf game is a hit, then revenue is tripled.\nChance of a Hit: 20%\n\nc. Freemium\n\nDownloads: 30 million within first month\nRevenue from Advertisers: 15 cents a month per user (number of users averaged over the month)\nThe first month has the most downloads, than the number of players using the game drops steadily and consistently over a year.\n\nd. Subscription\n\nDownloads: 30 million total\nSubscription Price: 0.99 cents per month\nPercentage of Players that start subscription: 15%\nAverage Life of Subscription: 5 months\n\nSuggested Solution:\nOverall, the life cycle of a game, especially a mobile version, is very short compared to other products. Therefore, except for a few huge hits (like Candy Crush Saga), the vast majority of revenue will be captured within a year. Make your calculations with this in mind.\na. Traditional\nRevenue: $2.99 * 15M = $45 million\nb. Free-to-Play\n\nAverage # of Players per month: (30m at start of year + 0 at end of year)/2 = 15 million\nRevenue from Light Players: 15m * 0.10 * $0.99 * 12 months/year = $17.8 million\nRevenue from Heavy Players: 15m * 0.01 * $0.99 * 10 * 12 months/year = $17.8 million\nRevenue: $17.8m + $17.8m = $35.6 million\nTotal Weighted Revenue with potential for hit: $35.6m * (1 – 0.2) + ($35.6 * 3) * 0.2 = $50 million\n\nc. Freemium/Ads\n\nAverage # of players per month: (30m at start + 0 at end)/2 = 15 million\nRevenue: $0.15 * 12 * 15m = $27 million\n\nd.Subscription\nRevenue: 30m * 0.15 * 5 * $0.99 = $22 million\nConclusion: Judging by the calculated (expected) revenues, Free-to-Play is the most attractive option for the client.\nNote: Bonus points to the candidate if he or she uses the hit probability to determine the Free-to-play revenue potential ($50 million vs. $35.6 million). An outstanding candidate will also need to point out that choosing the Free-To-Play model depends on the client having a higher risk tolerance, as the revenues are only greater if the game is a hit. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Calculate this value.\nSuggested Solution:\n10 Shag Carpets in Inventory.\nThe interviewee should either use the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) formula or logic. An example of possible logic would be to use something like the tables below to determine EOQ:\n\n\n\nOrder 20 Carpets at a time\nDay 1\nDay 2\nDay 3\n\n\nShags in inventory\n20\n10\n20\n\n\nCost ($)\n$5 (order cost)\n$10 (cost to store 10 carpets)\n$5 (order cost)\n\n\nRemaining inventory\n10\n0\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrder 10 Carpets at a time\nDay 1\nDay 2\nDay 3\n\n\nShags in inventory\n10\n10\n10\n\n\nCost ($)\n$5 (order cost)\n$5 (order cost)\n$5 (order cost)\n\n\nRemaining inventory\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\nEconomic order quantity (EOQ) is the order quantity that minimizes the total inventory holding costs and ordering costs. It is one of the oldest classical production scheduling models. EOQ applies only when demand for a product is constant over the year and each new order is delivered in full when inventory reaches zero. There is a fixed cost for each order placed, regardless of the number of units ordered. There is also a cost for each unit held in storage, commonly known as holding cost, sometimes expressed as a percentage of the purchase cost of the item.\nThe interviewer should provide the EOQ formula if needed (the interviewee is not expected to know the formula):\nEOQ formula = sqrt(2 * Demand * Order Cost / Holding Cost)\nQuestion 4: What is your final recommendation to the client for lowering costs?\nSuggested Solution:\nThe interviewee first should summarize his/her analysis, then suggest possible strategies:\n\nConvince Shag supplier to reduce the minimum order to 10 carpets.\nLower inventory storage cost to $0.50 per day.\n\nConclusion: In order to lower costs, the client should reduce minimum order size and lower inventory storage cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: supply chain optimization; organizational behavior; math problem.\nConsulting Firm: A.T. Kearney first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: healthcare: hospital & medical.\nCase Interview Question #00813: Our client is Michael Mahoney, CEO of Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE: BSX). Boston Scientific is a worldwide developer, manufacturer and marketer of non-invasive medical devices whose products are used in a range of interventional medical specialties, including interventional radiology, interventional cardiology, peripheral interventions, neuromodulation, neurovascular intervention, electrophysiology, cardiac surgery, vascular surgery, endoscopy, oncology, urology and gynecology.\nThe CEO of Boston Scientific wants you to establish the distribution network for the entry to the European market based on the promising sales projections from Marketing. Boston Scientific currently has manufacturing in Marlborough, Massachusetts and Raleigh, North Carolina and serves the U.S. market. The plant in Raleigh, NC has ample capacity for the projected sales in Europe.\nThe CEO has asked you to advise him on establishing a supply chain structure for the European Market. You have to look at the most appropriate distribution method for the European sales. There are 3 questions in this case.\nQuestion #1: What are the different factors you would consider in establishing a supply chain structure?\nPossible Answer:\nThis case requires the candidate to evaluate and recommend between two supply chain distribution plans. This will involve understanding of supply chain costs and intense quantitative analysis.\n\nTransportation costs (both inbound and outbound)\nWarehousing and operating costs\nInventory costs\nService levels for customers\n\nThe CEO of Boston Scientific is considering two options.\nOption 1: The first option is to have a one-hub distribution center (DC) in Berlin, Germany and 20 satellite warehouses in relevant European cities served that directly serve the customers.\nOption 2: The second option is to have four distribution centers in Berlin, Germany; Paris, France; Gothenburg, Sweden and Milan, Italy with no satellite warehouses. Berlin DC will serve the demand in Polish cities and the Paris DC will serve the demand in English cities.\nPreferred Service Levels\nIn the U.S., Boston Scientific has next day delivery to its customers and wants to establish similar criteria in Europe, if feasible. The CEO indicated that service levels and cost are the key criteria in determining how to set up the European Supply Chain.\nQuestion #2: Recommend which option the CEO should go with.\nNote to interviewer: The data below is given to the candidate as requested. Instruct the candidate to focus the analysis initially on Transportation costs, Warehousing costs and Service Levels. The inventory costs can be provided directly if there is not enough time left.\nAdditional Information:\na. Transportation Cost\nAll inbound transportation is by air and would take an average of three days from NC with same cost to all European cities. The distribution between countries would be through ground transportation. Transportation cost are given in Table 1.\nTable 1 – 2016 European Sale Estimates and transportation cost\n\n\n\nCountry\nPackage volume\n2016 Sale projections ($ in MM)\nAverage Pan European transportation cost from Berlin DC ($/package) for the 1 DC Model\nCost of shipping from satellite to customer ($/package) for the 1 DC Model\nAverage cost from Distribution center to customer in option 2 ($/package)\n\n\nGermany\n20K package\n$20\n8.5\n10.0\n10.0\n\n\nFrance\n15K package\n$15\n9\n10.0\n10.0\n\n\nEngland\n5K package\n$5\n9.5\n10.0\n10.0\n\n\nSweden\n10K package\n$10\n9.5\n10.0\n10.0\n\n\nPoland\n4K package\n$4\n9\n10.0\n10.0\n\n\nItaly\n12K package\n$12\n10\n10.0\n10.0\n\n\n\nb. Distribution Centers and Satellite Warehouse Cost\nDC and satellite warehouse operating costs are on average $30 per square meter including lease, utilities, labor and depreciation. The capital cost for a DC is on average $60 per square meter including building, equipment and initial shipment of inventory (not safety stock investment). Boston Scientific wants to own the DCs and lease public facilities for the satellite warehouses. You can ignore the markup for the public warehouse services. The minimum size for a distribution center is 1,000 square meter and space requirements are calculated at 0.1 square meter per unit of package.\nc. Service Levels\nService level is dependent upon the % of demand that could be delivered the next day, 2nd day, 3rd day etc. The service level for option one is 100% next day delivery. However, with option two 50% is next day, 30% is 2nd day and 20% is third day delivery.\nd. Inventory Details (only if time permits, else provide cost directly)\nFor option 1, initially inventory levels will be set at 100 days in the Berlin DC and 30 days in each satellite warehouses to meet projected customer demand.\nFor option 2, initially inventory levels will be set at 150 days in each of the DCs to meet demand for countries and cities served.\nPossible Answer:\nTotal Sales = $20 + $15 + $5 + $10 + $4 + $12 = $66MM\nTotal packages = 20K + 15K + 5K + 10K + 4K + 12K = 66,000\nOption One. 1 DC and 20 Satellite Warehouses\na. Transportation Cost\nDC to German Satellite Warehouse = $8.5/package x 20,000 = $170,000\nDC to French Satellite Warehouse = $9/package x 15,000 = $135,000\nDC to English Satellite Warehouse = $9.5/package x 5,000 = $47,500\nDC to Swedish Satellite Warehouse = $9.5/package x 10,000 = $95,000\nDC to Polish Satellite Warehouse = $9/package x 4,000 = $36,000\nDC to Italian Satellite Warehouse = $10/package x 12,000 = $120,000\nSub-total = $170,000 + $135,000 + $47,500 + $95,000 + $36,000 + $120,000 = $603,500\nCost of shipping from satellite warehouses to customers = $10/package\nTotal Cost of shipping = 66,000 * $10 = $660,000\nTotal Transportation Cost = $603,500 + $660,000 = $1,263,500\nb. Warehousing Cost\nCapital cost = $60/m2\nOperating cost = $30/m2\nBerlin DC\nInventory = 100 days\nSpace needed = 66000 package x 0.1 m2/package x (100/300) = 2200 square meter\nOperating Cost = 2200 x $30/m2 = $66,000\nCapital Cost = 2200 x $60/m2 = $132,000\nSatellite Warehouses\nInventory = 30 days\nSpace needed= 66000 package x 0.1 m2/package x (30/300) = 660 square meter\nOperating Cost = 660 x $30/m2 = $19,800\nTotal Warehousing Cost = $66,000 + $132,000 + $19,800 = $217,800\nc. Inventory Holding Cost\nCost of the inventory is 40% of sales.\nInventory holding cost is 20% of the inventory cost.\n100 days at the DC\n30 days at the warehouses\nCapital tied up at inventory = (130/300) x $66MM X 40% = $11.44MM\nHolding cost at DC = $66MM x 40% x 20% x (100/300) = $1,760,000\nHolding cost at satellite warehouses = $66MM x 40% x 20% x (30/300) = $528,000\nTotal Inventory Holding Cost = $1,760,000 + $528,000 = $2,288,000\nd. Total Annual Distribution Cost = Transportation Cost + Warehousing Cost + Inventory Holding Cost = $1,263,500 + $217,800 + $2,288,000 = $3,769,300\nOption Two. 4 DCs and no Satellite Warehouses\na. Transportation Cost\nBerlin DC to German customers = $10/package x 20,000 = $200,000\nBerlin DC to Polish customers = $10/package x 4,000 = $40,000\nParis DC to French customers = $10/package x 15,000 = $150,000\nParis DC to English customers = $10/package x 5,000 = $50,000\nGothenburg DC to Swedish customers = 10/package x 10,000 = $100,000\nMilan DC to Italian customers = $10/package x 12,000 = $120,000\nTotal Transportation Cost = $660,000\nb. Warehousing Cost\nInventory = 150 days\nSpace needed = 66000 package * 0.1 m2/package * (150/300) = 3300 square meter\nOperating Cost = 3300 x 30/m2 = $99,000\nCapital Cost = 4000 x 60/m2 = $240,000\nTotal Warehousing Cost = $339,000\nc. Inventory Holding Cost\n150 days at the DCs\nCapital tied up at inventory = (150/300) x $66MM x 40% = $13,200,000\nHolding cost at DCs = $66M x 40% x 20% x (150/300) = $2,640,000\nd. Total Annual Distribution Cost = Transportation Cost + Warehousing Cost + Inventory Holding Cost = $660,000 + $339,000 + $2,640,000 = $3,639,000\nThe distribution network in Option One is more expensive than Option Two when considering just transportation and warehousing costs. Higher service levels could be achieved with option one compared to option two.\nConsequently, the low service level and similar cost base make option two less favorable. Another consideration is that option two has a higher capital investment requirement due to more days of inventory. Also consider the inventory holding costs will be less with option 1.\nHence Option 1 is the recommended option.\nOther points that the candidate should draw upon:\nCandidates should present the tradeoff between distribution costs and customer service levels to evaluate the performance of the supply chain.\nCost\n\nInventory holding costs\nTransportation costs (network optimization, air vs. ground)\nWarehousing costs (own vs. lease, high inventory levels, shrinkage)\nOrdering costs\nShortage penalties and lost demand\n\nService Levels\n\nFill-rate percentages (% of demand satisfied on time)\nCycle service level (% of time demand satisfied completely)\nResponse time for customer demands\nRecognize that in this case the benefit of high service level is much more critical than inventory cost due to the high margins in the medical industry\n\nSince the total distribution costs are directly correlated with the average aggregate inventory levels on hand, candidates should also comment about reducing inventory levels:\n\nSmaller batch sizes and order quantities\nRisk pooling and postponement\nPackage to order\nProduct mix management\nImplementation costs and risks (exp. obsolescence)\n\nQuestion #3: What additional considerations should you factor in while establishing a distribution network?\nPossible Answer:\nAdditional considerations for the distribution network:\n\nTop-line impacts of two options and amount of capital tied up\nA hybrid option for reaching optimum cost levels\nDelivery frequency and inventory levels\nReducing safety stock levels\nFlexibility against future demand fluctuations\nBuild a qualitative weight scale between service levels and costs\n\nCandidates would also consider the aspects of distribution at an international level (tariffs, value-added tax) as well as the expiration date pressures on inventory, future growth outside EU countries i.e, options with scalability potential.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Suggested Approach\nThis estimation case can be solved via the Top Down Approach by starting the analysis with the number of gas stations observed in a location and scaled to whole country. On the other hand, the following Bottom Up Approach can also be used. It may be beneficial to ask the interviewer which approach is preferred.\n2. Suggested Solution\na. Estimate the total daily UK demand for fuel\n\nUK Population (2014): 60 Million\n# House holds: 15 Million (Assume 4 people per household)\n\n# Vehicles per household: 2\n# Vehicles: 30 Million\nAssume fuel efficiency: 13.5 km/L, Average driving: 15,000 km/year, year = 365 days, thus fuel consumption per vehicle per day: 15,000/(13.5 * 365) = 3 Liter/day\nTotal Daily UK Demand: 90 Million L.\n\nb. Estimate maximum daily fuel supply per gas station\n\nCapacity available by gas station: 12 hours per day per pump\nAverage time spent by car in a Gas Station: 10 minutes\n# Vehicles per Pump per Day: 12 * 60 min/10 min = 72\nAverage # Pumps per gas station: 4\n# Vehicles Served Daily: 288\n# Liters of fuel bought / vehicle: 45 L (50 L tank size)\nMax. Daily Gas Station Supply = 288 * 45 = 12,960 L\n\nc. Minimum number of gas stations needed\n90 million / 12,960 = 6,945\n3. Points to be noted and evaluated by the candidate:\n\nThe candidate must specify the average capacity used per Gas Station\nAlso the candidate should indicate the average time spent by ear in the Gas Station\nCandidate could check number of Gas stations per square meter\nCandidate could check number of Gas Stations per habitat\n\n4. Suggested Excellent Solution\nIn the calculation of number of vehicles some additional insights could be used\n\nNumber of rental cars\nNumber of taxis\nNumber of trucks\n\nKnowing that the number of gas stations in the UK has been declining (from over 12,000 in the last decade) due to the fact that: (1) small players can’t compete with large players like BP. (2) increasing focus on sustainability and lesser use of car transportation. (3) rising costs of oil causes consumers to buy less.\nSome remote towns should need to be covered by a gas station, even though the demand would be really low. This could increase the analysis by a 5 – 10%\nAlso it is important to note that in some countries the calculation for fuel consumption is by calculating the average consumption per 100 KM (e.g. 6 liters per 100 km / 50 km per day → 3 liters per day).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The client Guardian Life Insurance is one of the leading companies in this market. The CEO of the client company is observing a very sluggish growth in the past 3-4 years and has approached your consulting firm for help.\nQuestion 1: The client’s profits are decreasing in the past 5 years. What factors could affect profitability?\nAdditional Information: Only provide if asked \n\nRevenues are decreasing at an increasing rate, costs are constants.\nThe client’s new customers are increasing every year, repeat customers are decreasing.\n\nPossible Answer:\nSuggested Approach: Profits = Revenues – Costs\nRevenues:\n\nincremental premium from new customers\nrecurrent premium from existing customers\ninterests from investments (if mentioned, the candidate demonstrates excellent knowledge of insurance business).\n\nNeed to distinguish between B2C and B2B segments\nCosts:\n\noperational costs\nreclaims (related to the “risk profile” of the customer base)\nbranding\n\nSuggested Solution:\nThus, the loss in the premium from repeat customers is causing the decrease in profits. In what segments (B2C, B2B or both) is this decrease happening?

Suggested Approach\n• The first thing you want to do is to understand how much meat can be processed (the capacity) when the cows walk versus run. \n• Then analyze the cost implications of the cows walking versus running.\n• Next, calculate the size of the market and demand for the product.\n• Finally, match demand with supply.\n2. Additional Information to be provided:\n\nMeat is produced in a 3-step process: cow enters, meat is processed, and meat is delivered to the fast food centers.\nEach cow can make 25 hamburgers.\nThe meat processing shop opens 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, 4 weeks in a month.\n\nOnly provide the following info if asked:\n\nIf a cow walks into the meat processing unit: 10 cows can be processed in 1 hour.\nIf a cow runs into the meat processing unit: 20 cows can be processed in 1 hour.\nNumber of Milo’s Hamburgers chains the meat processing unit serves: 5;\nAssume each locality has a population of 70,000.\nOnly one chain on each locality.\n3 other competitors with equal market share: 25%\n\n3. Suggested Solution\na. Understanding the capacity\n\nNumber of hamburgers produced when the cow walks, in a month = 10 cows * 8 hour/day * 5 day/week * 4 week/month * 25 hamburgers = 40,000\nNumber of hamburgers produced when the cow runs, in a month = 20 cows * 8 hour/day * 5 day/week * 4 week/month * 25 hamburgers = 80,000\n\nb. The cost implications\nOnly provide the following information if asked:\nTable 1: Processing and Overheads cost estimates for both the scenarios\n\n\n\nCost\nWalk\nRun\n\n\nProcessing & Labour\n24,000\n48,000\n\n\nOverheads\n20,000\n35,000\n\n\nTotal Cost\n44,000\n83,000\n\n\nCost per burger\n1.1\n1.03\n\n\n\nc. Demand can be estimated as follows:\nTotal demand per month: 5 chains × 70,000 (population served per chain) / 4 (equally distributed among competitors) * 40% (target age group) * 1 (assuming one person eat one burger per month) = 35,000\nThis demand (35,000) can be managed with “walk” (40,000) to maintain the freshness of meat.\nAlternative Approach:\nCalculate potential customers (on targeted age group): 5 chains × 70,000 (population served per chain) / 4 (equally distributed among competitors) * 40% (target age group) = 35,000\nElaborate a bit more on consumption patterns for targeted group, e.g.:\n\nChildren: Maybe not all children are allowed to eat hamburgers? Then estimate # of hamburgers eaten per month on average\nAdults: estimate # of hamburgers eaten per month on average\n\nAn excellent response should also mention that running the cows helps to lower unit cost of meat production (costs drop by 7 cents/hamburger)\nd. Make a final recommendation\nAlthough looking through the production point of view, it seems to be worth to have the cows running into the process unit (lower unit costs by 7 cents/hamburger), the recommendation is  to just to walk the cows. Analysis shows that the demand is lower than the capacity, therefore no matter whether cows are running or walking, the increase in Total Costs which results from the implementation of the running scenario is an unnecessary cost with the current demand.\nAs there is excess capacity and the potential for per unit cost savings when larger volumes are produced, the client should consider methods to increase demand, such as the below, to be able to leverage production economies of scale:\n\nInvest in marketing efforts for the burgers\nCreate industry partnerships so that the burgers can be sold in more restaurants/chains.\nRent production capacity space to a third party\n\nFinal Recommendation\nCows should walk through process unit and the client company should aim to increase market demand to be able to capitalize on economies of scale.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The company, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Allstate (NYSE: ALL), sells car insurance direct to consumers online and over the phone, offering services to nearly 90 percent of the U.S. population in 40 states. Its primary competitors are other direct personal auto writers such as GEICO and Progressive.\nIn order to diversify its business, the CEO of Esurance wants to create an online shopping and comparison website for car insurance that connects car insurance agents with customers virtually. In this website, car insurance agents could pay a fee to be listed on the website. When customers are shopping for car insurance on the website, the site would compare quotes from the various agents for the customer for free. The customer would then contact his or her preferred agent directly based on the price comparison.\nDoes this sound like a profitable business for Esurance?\nPossible Answer:\nQuestion #1: What factors could affect the profitability of this car insurance comparison website?\nSuggested Solution:\nProfitability can be analyzed in terms of revenues and costs:\nRevenue factors may be:\n\nAbility to attain large volume of customers and variety of insurance provides to participate\nEase of use of website\nMarketing/advertising efforts to consumer\nNeed for this product, revenue structure of the website (whether agents pay a flat fee, per customer they win, etc.)\n\nCost factors could be:\n\nMaintenance of the website\nMarketing costs.\n\nQuestion #2: What is the market size for this business segment if this website is operated in Germany?\nAdditional Information: to be provided if asked\n10% people change insurance companies yearly on average. This is includes people who\ni) buy new insurance\nii) change their insurance\niii) no longer have insurance.\nIt is unlikely that car ownership is growing in a well developed market like Germany.\nYearly car insurance fee in Germany is around 1400 Euros on average.\nExtra points to the interviewee for mentioning different types of car insurance exist.\nSuggested Solution:\n1. Size of German population: 80 million (interviewee should know, otherwise provide)\n2. Number of people that drive cars (not to be provided to interviewee; interviewee should estimate)\na. Assume average life expectancy is 80\nb. Segment market by urban vs. rural:\n\nUrban: (60 million people)\nRural: (20 million people)\n\nc. Segment into families, 2 people per family: 30 million urban families, 10 million rural families.\nd. Car ownership per family: 100% in rural, 70% urban\n3. Number of cars in Germany = (30 million * 70% + 10 million * 100%) = (21 million + 10 million) = 31 million\n4. Population who will shop for car insurance online:\n\nAssume people under age 20 don’t own cars\nAge 20 to 50: 90% willing to shop online for car insurance\nAge 50 to 80: none buy online (older generation)\n\nTotal = 90% of 3/8 of population will shop for car insurance online\n5. People who change car insurance each year\n31 million * 10% = 3.1 million\n6. People who would be willing to buy car insurance online\n3.1 million * (3/8) * 90% = 1 million\nRevenue = 1 million * 1,400 Euro = approximately 1.4 billion Euro\nConclusion: Online car insurance market in Germany is approximately 1.4 billion Euro.\nQuestion #3: How much could the Esurance website charge agents for listing ads?\nAdditional Information: to be provided if asked\n\nAgents pay based on how many searches customers make on the Esurance website.\nOnly 10% of car insurance searches actually result in a purchase for each agent.\n\nSuggested Solution:\nAverage revenue per customer search = 1400 Euro * 10% convertion rate = 140 Euro\nFee to agent per search should be less than the revenue insurance company receives per customer search (possibly 1-5% is reasonable), therefore, fee charged to agent should be = 140 Euro * 5% = 7 Euro per customer search (the interviewee could suggest from 1.5 Euro to 7 Euro)\nExcellent Response:\nSuggest different pricing fees based on cost per click or even cost per displaying ad (not even for clicks).\nQuestion #4: Please advise the Esurance CEO whether this is a profitable business.\nSuggested Solution:\nYes, this is a profitable business because potential revenues are greater than costs.\nRevenues:\n\nLarge insurance market in Germany\nGood margins: 1-5% fee to insurance\n\nCosts:\n\nCapital requirements are low\nMarketing costs are moderate\nWebsite maintenance costs are low\n\nPotential Risks: need for extensive marketing, potentially new business model for consumers, potential for new entrants who can easily copy the business model.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "title": "Ryanair to Introduce 3 Ticket Fare Scheme",

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: increase sales; math problem.\nConsulting Firm: Arthur D. Little first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: airlines.\nCase Interview Question #00776: The client Ryanair Ltd. (ISEQ: RYA, LSE: RYA, NASDAQ: RYAAY) is an European airline headquartered in Swords, Dublin, Ireland, with its primary operational bases at Dublin and London Stansted Airports. In 2013, Ryanair was both the largest European airline by scheduled passengers carried, and the busiest international airline by passenger numbers. The airline has been characterised by its rapid expansion, a result of the deregulation of the aviation industry in Europe in 1997 and the success of its “hybrid” business model.\nRyanair is a hybrid carrier, a combination of full service and low cost types. As a result of this, recently customers and the aviation industry become confused of their true positioning and the company has been garnering substantial losses.  Their operations in Europe cater to the budget travel category and those outside the continent are of the long haul type. They offer different fares: flexible and regular.\nThe flexible fare allows customers to avail themselves of additional features (changing dates, time of flight etc.) by paying an additional fee.\nThe client Ryanair has engaged you to recommend different types of tickets and services in the economy class to revamp their value proposition and generate additional revenue. How would you go about this case?\nPossible Answer:\nQuestion 1: What factors would you consider to determine market positioning for the client?\nSuggested Solution:\nFactors to be considered are customers (target segments), competition, targeting the correct segment by designing products and services which conform to the value proposition, effectiveness of communication used for market positioning, customer satisfaction, customer values and opinions.\nCost structure is an important factor, too.\nQuestion 2: The client Ryanair is focusing on the short-haul economy segment. The market trends are increasingly in favor of budget travel and EasyJet (LSE: EZJ), a key competitor, is gaining strength. The client Ryanair has decided to compete by launching 3 budget fare types: low-cost, medium and premium. Please suggest airline offerings which could differentiate each of the 3 fare types.\nSuggested Solution:\nBuyers of the premium budget fare should be provided additional service such as pre-booking of seats, additional cabin baggage, check-in at the airport counters, priority queues for boarding, food and beverages in flight etc.\nBuyers of the medium budget fare can be offered a sub-set of the above. Costs incurred in providing these services should be the main consideration while determining the service package.\nLow-cost budget travellers should be offered the above for a price.\nQuestion 3: What are the internal challenges that the client Ryanair could experience if the client were to introduce the 3 budget fare types? Note to interviewer: the purpose of this question is to judge the candidate’s ability to structure his/her thought process.\nSuggested Solution:\nThe ideal answer would be to consider each step in the entire journey: booking of tickets; preparation for flight; at the airport; in-flight, and identify challenges associated with each.\nBooking of tickets: On-line booking services would have to be revamped to include the 3 fare types. The customers might get confused by three different options of fares and the provisions associated with each.\nPreparation for flight: If the traveler needs to bring additional luggage after booking is complete he would have to buy extra slots- this should be specified to avoid inconvenience to customers on the day of the flight.\nAt the airport and in-flight: confusion arising out of 3 fare types as customer handling depends on the type of fare selected. Re-training of airline personnel required. Change management would be crucial.\nThe candidate should cover at least all the above mentioned points. Points are to be deducted if change management is neglected\nQuestion 4: The client Ryanair currently offers only 1 fare type which is analogous to the medium budget fare in the proposed pricing structure. With reference to revenue what is the main risk in implementing the 3 fare scheme?\nSuggested Solution:\nOne of the main risks is to effectively promote and market each of the 3 fare types to attract the right amount of customers to each far type to optimize the profitability of the whole scheme. As an example, customers who were purchasing the higher priced medium budget tickets would shift towards the low-cost budget type. It would be difficult to attract enough premium passengers to outweigh this, which would result in a lower revenue level compared to before.\nQuestion 5: What would be the most effective way to optimize revenue from the 3 fare scheme?\nSuggested Solution:\nThe first step would be to analyses the spending patterns of the 2 different customer types: budget & business. Business travelers are more likely to purchase the premium budget fare and leisure travelers are more likely to purchase the medium and low-cost fare types.\nBased on the flying patterns (routes, frequency and time of travel) of each customer type the most relevant fare types should be made available while the availability of the others should be limited. For instance: business travelers opt to travel early morning or late night usually between certain destinations. On such flights the availability of medium and low cost budget fares should be limited.\nQuestion 6: Please calculate the revenue that the client Ryanair can expect to generate per day with the below pricing/customer information.\nAdditional Information: (To be shared with interviewee)\n1. New Pricing\n\nBudget Fare Price: €100\nMedium Fare Price: €140\nPremium Fare Price: €180\n\n2. Average Day: 10,000 passengers\n3. Flight Patterns:\n\n40% passengers fly in early morning between 6:00 – 10:00\n27% passengers fly during day 10:00 – 18:00\n33% passengers fly in evening/late night 18:00 – 24:00\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly Morning\nDuring Day\nEvening/Late Night\nSum\n\n\nPassengers\n40%\n27%\n33%\n100%\n\n\nBusiness Travelers\n75%\n20%\n60%\n\n\n\nLeisure\n25%\n80%\n40%\n\n\n\n\n4. Passenger segmentation: 50% of passengers of both customer groups (business and leisure) continue to buy the medium fair ticket.

The company was originally called Tiny Speck, and their first product was a computer game called Glitch, a social massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs).\nAfter Glitch was launched, it met with lukewarm interest from game players and the company subsequently closed the product. Now the CEO of Slack Technologies wants to start selling professional collaboration, file management and sharing tools internationally. These tools are sold as a software package called “Slack”; they enable users to collaborate on team projects, share files, send instant messages, hold online meetings, and do video chat. The market for this software would mainly consist of business customers, including small and medium enterprises (SME) and large corporations. However, this software will also be sold for personal use. The client Slack Technologies is deciding into which market to launch their new product. How would you help them decide?\nPossible Answer:\nQuestion 1: What factors should be considered when selecting the target market internationally?\nSuggested Solution:\na.

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: increase sales/revenues; pricing.\nConsulting Firm: McKinsey & Company final round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: software, information technology (IT); mass media.\nCase Interview Question #00765: Our client Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE: TRI, TSX: TRI) is a major multinational mass media and information firm founded in Toronto and based in New York City. It was created by the Thomson Corporation’s purchase of British-based Reuters Group in April 2008. The company has four divisions: Financial and Risk Operation, Legal, Tax & Accounting, and Thomson Scientific. For this case, we will focus on the Thomson Scientific division only.\nThomson Scientific is a research content aggregator and distributer to academic institutions, local libraries, government institutions. Their 2010 revenues are USD $1 billion dollars. However, the CEO of Thomson Reuters thinks that the Thomson Scientific division has not tapped into potential opportunities that are out there and wants your help in understanding how to go about these opportunities.\nHow would you approach the situation?\nAdditional Information: (to be provided to candidate upon request)\nIndustry: although the 2008 economic recession had a negative impact on some local libraries, the industry is pretty stable.\nCompetition: low – medium in research content space.\nProducts: the Thomson Scientific division has three products – one for each segment. These products are Academic Research (ACA_RES), Linrary Research (LIB_RES), Government Research (GOV_RES). These products are web solutions that can operate independently or in integrated fashion with other database tools clients typically have.\nIndividual revenue streams: ACA_RES, GOV_RES revenues went up, but LIB_RES revenues went down.\nIf asked, mention that the revenues of LIB_RES went down by 3% compared to previous year.\nPossible Answer:\nQuestion #1: Ask why the LIB_RES revenues may have gone down.\nPossible Solution:\nEconomy: many local libraries depend on funds from local city government and state/federal grants. The 2008 recession had an impact on the people’s livelihoods because of which the tax dollars went down constraining grants to local libraries.\nAlso due to poor economy, libraries were not able to raise funds from private institutions as they were able to pre-recession period.\nNote:\nThe candidate should go back to the original question of how to tap into some of the market opportunities.\nThe candidate should pick up that it is a revenue related question and put out his/her approach on how to increase the revenues.\nA good candidate will prioritize the issues related to revenues and would say he/she will take a look at the LIB_RES product and its revenues and see what caused the decline besides economic issues and if something can be done about that.\nQuestion #2: Directly ask the candidate “What do you think about the LIB_RES product?” if candidate does not point it out.\nPossible Solution:\nThe candidate should ask about all the aspects of revenues and costs. Provide the following additional information if asked.\n\n# of clients: 2,000 libraries in the U.S.\nAverage sale price: $45,000 per annum\nContract period: 1 year\nSales channels: direct sales force\nCost to sell and manage each contract: $20,000 including sales overhead and salaries\n\nCandidate should get product and its pricing.\nCandidate should identify that the number of clients may have changed due to economic pressures.\nCandidate must calculate the profitability of this segment. He/she should identify that it is a profitable segment (profit of $45,000 – $20,000 = $25,000 per client) and price could be the most likely reason for declining revenues.\nAdditional questions the candidate may have:\n\nHow is the product sold? — Sold as a package whether the client uses the features or not.\nDoes the client have options from competitors? — Yes, but our product is best in the industry for ease of use especially for children and elderly that frequent the public libraries.\n\nAt this point, the candidate should pick up on given information and point out that there are some features that our clients do not want in our product. Maybe there is an opportunity to examine some of the key feature offerings and unbundle and offer them as a configurable, customizable product for a lower price. For example:\n\nOffer the product based on number of users – license based.\nCharge clients based on usage of our information.\n\nQuestion #3: Our client Thomson Scientific wants to go with license-based pricing. Ask the candidate to calculate the price per user license. Ask also for the breakeven volume of seats.\nPossible Solution:\nA good candidate will ask one or more of the following questions to gather information.\nTable 1. Average number of users per public library (per month):\n\n\n\nSegments within Public Libraries\nSmall, Medium, Large\n\n\n# of users of these libraries\nsmall – 2000, medium – 5000, large – 8000\n\n\n# of libraries\nsmall – 800, medium – 750, large – 450\n\n\n# of users of our product\n60% on average\n\n\n\nCalculations of Average number of users per public library (per month)\n\nSmall 2000 * 0.6 = 1200\nMedium 5000 * 0.6 = 3000\nLarge 8000 * 0.6 = 4800\n\nCandidate should mention that to keep up with our revenues and possibly increase them, we should price each license at a minimum price of (Current Revenue for the product / Total users).\nTotal users per month: 1200 * 800 + 3000 * 750 + 4800 * 450 = 5,370,000 per month.\nCurrent Revenue = $45,000 * 2,000 = $90,000,000.\nPrice = $90,000,000 / 5,370,000 = approximately $17 dollars. (If they rounded 5,370,000 to 5,000,000 they would get $18 dollars which can also work)\nA good candidate will also look at profits for each segment within LIB_RES and calculate breakeven licenses for all segments.\nBreak Even = Costs/Margin per seat = $20,000/$17 = 1180 licenses per library, assuming the variable cost of each license is $0 because it is a software product.\n4. Conclusion\nA. Recommendation\n\nGiven the license price we just arrived at, our client Thomson Scientific should sell each seat at a minimum of $17.\nA good candidate will say that because of our product quality, larger clients may pay more for each seat, e.g. $20 a seat. In that case, the revenues can be greater than the current revenues.\n\nB. Next Steps\n\nOur client Thomson Scientific should conduct a survey to see if their clients are interested to pay per seat/license including the price point per seat.\nThis would also help our client understand other issues public libraries may face in terms of customer visitation patterns and how that can impact the per license sale of our clients product.\nOther ways to increase revenue is to sell to consortiums (e.g. group of libraries in a State/City).\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Start with the population of Romania: 20 million –> the client wants 5% market share.\n2. Geographic dispersion of Romanian population (to be given if asked by interviewee):\n\n11 million people live in urban locations\n9 million live in rural locations\nrural areas = 90% country areas\n2 million people live in Bucharest, the capital city.\nRomania has 6 other cities with population over 200,000.\nRomania has 14 other cities with population over 100,000.\nApproximately the remaining 15 million people live in smaller cities and rural locations.\n\n3. In order to make the business model most effective, the client should focus on serving the central urban areas.\n4. Average customers served per each branch:\na. One teller can serve approximately 1 customer in 10 minutes, and tellers work 9 hour a day\n= approx. 50 customers/day\nwith 250 working days per year = 12,500 customers per year\nTeller utilization rate: 80% (tellers are unoccupied 20% of the time)\nConsidering utilization, one teller serves 10,000 customers/year\nb. Typical bank branch holds 3-6 tellers, serves 30,000 to 60,000 customers/year\n1 million customers served among smaller branch (30,000 customers) = 33 branches\n1 million customers served among bigger branch (60,000 customers) = 17 branches\nTherefore, approximately 30 branches are needed for the client to reach 1 million customers.\n5. Branch locations could be dispersed as below:\n\n10 branches in the capital city Bucharest\n6 branches (one each) in the 6 cities with over 200,000 people\n14 branches in the 14 next largest cities with population over 100,000.\n\nExcellent Response:\nThe interviewee should note that more than 30 branches may actually be needed to reach 1 million customers, as some additional branches may need to be opened in key locations which are less profitable and have fewer customers simply in order to compete with other local banks and to get market share.\nEssentially, the client Deutsche Bank may need to have a few underutilized or even smaller but convenient locations in order to increase its brand image in this new market. 40-50 new branch openings may be a more realistic number. In addition, the interviewee should mention that the client Deutsche Bank should consider opening stores with a variety of sizes and formats to meet the customer demand in each particular target customer region.\nQuestion 3: The client Deutsche Bank has a large focus on the middle class urban population. However, the bank would also like to reach the agricultural consumer, as farmers still make up a significant portion of the Romanian population. With what tactics could the bank target the agricultural consumer?\nSuggested Solution:\nThe client Deutsche Bank should alter its business model and strategy slightly when targeting the agricultural customer as opposed to the average urban population, for instance:\n\nOffer attractive loans: farmers oftentimes need to buy large farming machinery and oftentimes require financing.\nUse different marketing strategy that targets agricultural segment: many Romanian farmers may not be comfortable with technology. Instead, direct mail offerings or phone calls or personal visits may be best marketing tools.\nCreate a specialized account for farmers that includes insurance, such as crop or capital protection from natural disasters.\nEnable telephone banking and travelling bankers who visit smaller cities in rural locations in which bank branches are not present.\n\nTo conclude, the client should adopt different marketing tools geared towards the agricultural customers include special banking instruments and outreach techniques.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: industry analysis; competitive response.\nConsulting Firm: Bain & Company final round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: utilities; energy.\nCase Interview Question #00766: The client is The Pacific Gas and Electric Company (NYSE: PCG), commonly known as PG&E. It is an investor-owned utility that provides natural gas and electricity to most of the northern two-thirds of California, from Bakersfield almost to the Oregon border. PG&E was founded in 1905 and is currently headquartered in the Pacific Gas & Electric Building in San Francisco.\nOver the past several decades, many U.S. states have moved to deregulate their electric markets, with 24 states allowing for at least some competition among retail electric providers (REPs) including California, Texas, and New York.\nThe year is 2009. As a combination gas and electric utility  (regulated monopoly), the client Pacific Gas and Electric Company was preparing for an upcoming change in the state regulatory environment when electric power generation would become a competitive business. A new VP of Marketing and Sales was put in place to prepare PG&E for the competitive marketplace. As part of a Bain case team retained by PG&E to advise the new VP of Marketing and Sales, how would you go about this case?\nAdditional Information: (to be provided to candidate upon request)\nComposition of PG&E’s customer base:\n\n\n\n\nResidential Customers\nMajor Industrial and Commercial (I&C) Customers\nRemaining I&C Customers\n\n\nNumber of customers\n1.8M\n1,000\n199K\n\n\nShare of 2008 Revenues: (2008 Total Revenues = $1.0B)\n50%\n30%\n20%\n\n\n\nPossible Answer:\nStep 1: Identify the critical issues\nInterviewer: “Given this information, where do you think the case team should focus?”\n1. Good Initial Questions\nAre the gas and electric businesses inter-related?\n- Do they serve the same customers? (some overlap)\n- Will the de-regulation of electric power generation impact the gas business? (no)\n- What is the relative size of the electric power businesses? (electric = 80% of revenues and 85% of profits)\nIs it therefore safe to assume that the composition of the overall customer base reflects the electric business as well? (yes)\nGood Answer:\nGiven the size and the dynamics of the electric power market I will focus on that part of the business. With the emerging deregulation, the key marketing issue is customer retention.\nSince the client will likely lose some customers with the upcoming deregulation (starting with a monopoly they only have one direction to move) the key question is which segments of customers the client should invest in retaining.\nFor extra credit articulate additional questions which drive to actions: what are their needs, how is the organization aligned to meet those needs today and what organizational and strategic changes should be made to improve the way we serve target segments.\nPotential Pitfalls:\n\nGetting caught up in trying to understand dynamics of gas and electric businesses. a few simple questions can make it clear that the electric business is what matters.\nDigging into detailed regulatory issues.\nNot identifying retention as the critical issue.\nTrying to develop strategies to retain all customers rather than focusing on segments.\n\nStep 2: Specify an analytic framework\nInterviewer: “How would you determine on which segments the client should focus?”\nUseful frameworks:\na. Customer segments should be ranked based on two criteria:\n- Value: profitability of power generation to the client.\n- Vulnerability: risk of losing the customers (segments) to competitors.\nb. “Value” should be based on lifetime value of the customer segment. This incorporates the investment required to acquire the customers, their annual profitability, and the expected “life” of a customer.\nc. Vulnerability would capture the likelihood of different segments of customers switching to competitive offerings once deregulation occurs.\nd. Extra Credit Observation: there is likely to be some correlation between value and vulnerability as new entrants will probably attempt to target the highest value customer segments first.\nPotential pitfalls:\n\nTrying to apply a “standard” framework to this fairly focused question–Keep it simple.\nNot considering all components of lifetime value (e.g., acquisition costs and lifetime) as that ranking can vary considerably from a ranking based on current margin.\n\nStep 3: Prioritize/Develop Hypothesis\nInterviewer: “What is your hypothesis of which segments are highest priority?”\nGood hypothesis:\na. The first step would be to further segment the customer base. Specifically, I am most interested in understanding any sub-segments within major I&C customers (avgerage revenue of $300K) where needs probably vary dramatically by industry (i.e., government, retail, process industries, etc.) There are probably not major distinctions in the needs of residential customers by segment.\nb. I would therefore hypothesize the following customer prioritization:\n- Large Industrial customers should be the initial focus because they will be most valuable (high electric usage in one location for a long time translates into low acquisition costs, high margins and a long life) and the most vulnerable (easy to target and valuable to competitors).\n- Large Commercial customers will rank second because large commercial customers (e.g., grocery chains) are heavy users but harder to serve because of multiple locations and higher turnover (high acquisition costs and shorter customer life).\n- Small I&C and Residential customers are of lower value and are less vulnerable to competition because their usage is relatively low, they are more costly for a competitor to target and for most individuals, the electric bill is a relatively small expense so they will not go out of their way to seek an alternative provider.\nPotential pitfalls:\n\nFailing to further segment customers misses a lot of the potential richness of the case.\nDigging into residential customer issues because that is what you understand best.\nForgetting to consider the acquisition costs and customer life issues.\nNot clearly explaining any assumptions you are making.\n\nStep 4: Structure/execute analysis\nInterviewer: “What analysis would you have the case team perform to test your hypothesis?”\nGood response:\na. Conduct customer research to further segment customers by needs and to assess the vulnerability of segments based on propensity to switch/loyalty behavior.\nb. To prioritize segments the case team must first estimate each of the major elements of the value equation:\n- Acquisition cost based on sales and marketing costs devoted to that segment (either tracked directly or estimated through interviews/surveys of sales and marketing depts.)\n- Volume based on usage for that segment (or in the case of 1000 Major I&C customers can track actual historic usage by specific customers).\n- Profitability margin based on usage patterns (peak loads, timing of peaks, etc.) developed in conjunction with technical and finance resources from the client.\n- Customer life based on industry research regarding the typical life of that type of business.\nc. To assess vulnerability utilize output of research and supplement with an assessment of the attractiveness of segments to likely new competitors (qualitative assessment).\nd. Create a 2X2 matrix plotting segments based on value and vulnerability.\nPotential pitfalls:\n\nNot being creative in places and ways to gather data and conduct analysis.\nNot attempting to get actual data or at least samples of actual data wherever possible and instead relying on assumptions for critical drivers of value.\nNot articulating framework for visually capturing output of analysis to articulate/demonstrate the answer.\n\nStep 5: Drive to recommendations\nInterviewer: “Based on your analysis, what should the client do?”\nGood response:\nNow that we have prioritized customer segments, the issue is how the client should apply sales, marketing and potentially technical resources differentially against the highest priority segments.\nDefinite recommended actions:\n\nFocus marketing activities against developing programs that meet critical needs identified in research (i.e., devices/programs to increase energy efficiency).\nDedicate more sales/non-technical service support to highest priority segments (e.g., improved billing services).\n\nPotential recommended actions (evaluate cost/benefit tradeoffs):\n\nInvest more to deliver higher technical service (less downtime) to highest priority segments.\nMore backup generators/systems where high priority customers may be clustered (areas with a lot of process plants, for example).\nMore technical personnel on duty to make repairs whenever system does go down.\n\nPotential pitfalls:\n\nGeneral/non-specific recommendations (e.g., improve service without describing how)\nNot distinguishing with actions you can definitely recommend now vs. actions that would require additional research because of the investment required.\nBeing unrealistic in recommendations.\n\nKeys to the Case:\nThe background slide to the case does not clearly state the issue to be addressed. You must decide where the leverage is without getting distracted by the existence of the gas business or delving into regulatory concerns.\nThere is really only one framework that works for this case and it is not a “standard” framework. The critical variables to prioritize customers are value and vulnerability (or risk of defection). A simple 2 X 2 matrix works best.\nThere are not a lot of numbers to use in this case but they can help you develop your hypothesis.\nBe comprehensive and creative in the approach for analyzing the value of a customer. It is critical to consider the lifetime value vs. just the margin. A methodology can be created where you calculate actual inputs for most variables of the equation.\nDriving recommendations to discussion on deploying actual sales, service and marketing resources is the point of the case. The prioritization is interesting but the question is what do you do once you understand how to prioritize.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Costa’s Cafe serves only coffee and latte. This small coffee shop has been around for decades and is known for its high quality drinks and cozy atmosphere.\nHistorically, Costa’s Cafe has been very popular among the local people in Hanover and has enjoyed very healthy profitability. Recently, however, the cafe has seen declining profits over the last few quarters. The owner of Costa’s Cafe has hired you to help increase its profits. What would you do?\nAdditional Information: (to provided upon request)\nNote that this is a typical McKinsey style interviewer led case with lots of tables and heavy math.\nThere are two other coffee shops in the nearby area that sell coffees and pastries. (There is no further information on these competitors.) \nCosta’s Cafe currently serves only two items (coffee and latte) in three different cup sizes:\n\nSmall: 8 oz\nMedium: 12 oz\nLarge: 16 oz\n\nPossible Answer:\nIf the candidate touches on prices or costs, ask him/her:\nQuestion #1.

What is the average profit that Costa’s Cafe earns per day?\nAdditional Information:\n\nEach customer purchases exactly one beverage.\nTwo baristas are working at any given time. Baristas are paid $15/hour.\nBusiness hours: 7AM to 10PM, Monday through Friday. Closed on weekends.\nThe number of customers per hour is listed below (Table 4). Customers leave if they can’t be served quickly.\nOn average, it takes 2 minutes for a barista to complete an order. Coffee is served fairly quickly, while lattes take significantly longer to make. (The candidate should realize that only 60 customers can be served per hour by the 2 baristas.)\n\nTable 4.

A strong candidate should suggest adding or subtracting baristas based on demand.\nQuestion #3. If you could change the number of baristas during each time period, what would be the daily profit for Costa’s Cafe?\nPossible Solution:\nBy adding a third barista in the morning shifts and reducing one at night, the new profit would be $787.50 per day – see below Table 5.\nTable 5.

(If candidate mentions that competitors sell pastries while Costa’s Cafe does not…) What factors should Costa’s Cafe consider before purchasing an oven to sell pastries?\nPossible Answwer:\nRevenues\n\nDoughnut sales, increased synergies with coffee/volume of customers.\n\nCosts\n\nFixed costs – purchasing/maintaining oven, setting up display case, storage, advertising.\nVariable costs – ingredients, hiring/training staff.\n\nCapacity\n\nRoom in cafe for oven and ingredients.\nBaristas available to accommodate for increase in demand.\n\nBrand image – Costa’s Cafe is known for its coffee and atmosphere; adding pastries may change brand image and drive away loyal customers, especially if they are low quality.\nCompetition – price and quality compared to competitors.\nAlternative opportunities – purchasing doughnuts from somewhere else.\nQuestion #6. A new espresso machine, priced at $2000, can greatly decrease the time it takes to make a latte. The average time it takes to complete an average customer’s order decreases from 2 minutes to 90 seconds. How long would it take to pay back the $2000 espresso machine?\nPossible Answer:\n90 seconds per order would mean two baristas can now serve (60 min / 1.5 min) * 2 = 80 orders per hour.\nDaily profit shown below in Table 6, calculated with the optimal number of baristas.\n$2000 / ($922.50 – $787.50) = 14.8 days ~= 15 days\nThe new espresso machine would be paid back in 15 days .\n4 Baristas in the 7-10AM would also yield similar profits with the advantage of turning away fewer customers.\nTable 6.

The company was organized as a partnership in 1867 and incorporated in 1873 under the laws of the State of Connecticut. It is publicly traded on the NYSE Mkt with symbol ACU.\nThe year is 1992. As one of the largest diversified manufacturers of office supplies, Acme has historically enjoyed very rapid growth. Both their sales and pre-tax profits grew at an astounding 15% CAGR during the 1980s, while the industry average was only 8%. In 1990 and 1991, however, the client’s sales declined 8% per year, and profits were even worse, down 40% year over year. You have been hired by the CEO of Acme to investigate their problems. How would you about it? What would you propose Acme to turn around their declining business?\nAdditional Information: (to be provided to candidate upon request)\nExhibit 1. Client Company \n1. Acme is one of the largest diversified manufacturers of office products, with sales of $300M in 1991.\n- strong brands.\n- significant advertising and marketing expense to support these brands.\n- historical growth generated by product line extensions and 4 key acquisitions.\nNote: In a case interview, this information may be presented verbally.\n2. Client company Acme is organized into 5 autonomous operating divisions, but with shared manufacturing and marketing functions.\n- shared costs (45% of total) are allocated to products on a percent of sales method (e.g. if product X is 1% of total Acme sales, it is allocated 1% of indirect manufacturing costs, distribution expenses, marketing costs, and corporate overhead).\n- current manufacturing capacity utilization is ~50%.\n3. Acme’s stock is publicly traded\n- current P/E is 8\n- low long-term debt\n- industry analysts are predicting that Acme will become an acquisition target in the near future given a strong balance sheet but weakening earnings.\nExhibit 2.

In 1990 and 1991, however, the market declined 5% per year.\nSuperstore channel is becoming increasingly critical:\n- superstores have gained 10 share points in the last 2 years\n- superstores typically offer products at 30% discount to small retailers / dealers.\nSuperstores are aggressively substituting private label products for traditional brand names:\n- For example, Staples, Inc. is currently negotiating with private label stapler manufacturers in China.\n- Acme’s most profitable product is a high-end branded stapler.\n- Staples, Inc. is now Acme’s largest single customer.\nSource: Acme Product Marketing; Analyst Reports; Market Research\nPossible Answers:\nStep 1: Identify the critical issues\nInterviewer: “What do you think are the critical issues facing this client?”, or, “Where would you focus your efforts at this client?”\nReasonable Answers:\nThere are a lot of issues here, but I’d like to focus first on the near-term profitability problem. Given that the client has seen such a dramatic decrease in profits, I want to examine what’s been driving the erosion here.\nBetter Answer:\nFrom a strategic perspective, there are some worrisome trends:\n- channels shifting toward mass retailers\n- emergence of private label\nThese trends are both negative from Acme’s perspective:\n- increasing price pressures from superstores.\n- threat to Acme’s core branded business.\nBut, decreasing profitability is making Acme highly vulnerable in the short run, so profitability must be directly addressed, and quickly. This is where I would focus initially.\nPotential Pitfalls:\nNot taking the general manager or investor’s perspective.\nFocusing on a relevant issue but missing the big picture\n- “I think this private label problem is really a threat, so I’d like to focus my efforts here.”\nPicking an area which you know a lot about, but which isn’t central to the case.\n- “Let’s talk about Acme’s capital structure….”\nNot using background facts to support your arguments.\nFailing to ask clarifying questions to ensure understanding of background data (as appropriate).\nStep 2: Specify an analytic framework\nInterviewer: “How would you approach this problem?”, or, “Specifically, what would be the key elements of your analysis?”\nUseful Frameworks:\nI’d like to break this out in terms of Revenues and Costs:\nRevenues = price x volume\n- price: pressure from discounters, likely eroding premium with emergence of private label.\n- volume: market decline, share loss to private label.\nCosts = variable + fixed\n- variable / fixed: product line complexity.\n- fixed: capacity utilization.\nI’d approach the profit erosion issue by grouping the key issues around customers, competitors, and costs (3Cs):\n- customers: recession driving lower market volumes, switching to low-price / lower-margin channels, shift away from branded to private label products.\n- competitors: emergence of low-cost offshore players.\n- costs: product line complexity, excess capacity.\nPotential pitfalls:\n\nNot specifying a framework (scattershot approach).\nDigging deep into one area (e.g. share loss) before laying out the overall structure.\nApplying a framework that will not help you decompose the problem (e.g. SWOT analysis is not particularly useful for profitability problems).\nApplying a framework that causes you to spend a lot of time on issues that aren’t highly leveraged (e.g. with Porter’s 5 Forces, you could end up wasting a lot of time on entry barriers in this case).\n\nStep 3: Prioritize/develop hypothesis\nInterviewer: “So, what issue would you pursue first?”, or, “Which do you think is the most leveraged area for analysis?”\nGood Response: (based on 3C’s framework)\nIt is unlikely Acme can do much about customer and market trends:\n- macro economic factors are obviously out of Acme’s control.\n- given the superior value-proposition of the superstores, I don’t think Acme will be able to stop channel migration.\n- if the superstores are aggressively moving to private label, and the customer base is becoming increasingly pricesensitive, additional advertising / marketing efforts will probably not prevent the shift away from traditional brands to private label — especially given spending levels here that are already high.\nThe competitive development of low-cost offshore producers would seem to be driven by these customer and market trends, and also isn’t under Acme’s control.\nTherefore, Acme should focus on cost reduction to improve profitability:\n- most actionable by the client (e.g. complexity reduction)\n- much faster payback than brand-building or a major strategic shift (e.g. vertical integration).\n- cost cutting will become increasingly critical as our margins are squeezed by superstores and price premium falls against private label.\nPotential pitfalls\n\nReluctance to develop a hypothesis in the absence of perfect information.\nNeglecting to explain to the interviewer why you are focusing on a given area.\nNot using the facts from the case to support your arguments.\nLosing sight of the big picture / most critical issue.\nNot differentiating between internal and external factors: what can the client actually influence and what is out of their control?\n\nStep 4: Structure/execute analysis\nInterviewer: “What analysis would you need to perform to address the issue?”, or, “How would you develop your hypothesis on reducing costs?”\nGood Response: (complexity reduction)\nThe most important analysis necessary to reduce complexity in the various product lines is to develop an accurate picture of product profitability from a managerial perspective.\nProduct-specific revenues and direct costs (e.g. direct labor) are relatively easy to obtain. Therefore, product cost allocation for indirect costs (45% of total) becomes critical in this case.\nOne good way to allocate indirect costs is to first identify the key cost drivers in each cost area, and then allocate costs to specific products based on their usage of those drivers. For example, the key cost driver in the area of warehousing rent and utilities is square footage. Therefore, I would allocate these costs to products based on the amount of space they require for storage in the warehouse.\nOf course, it is also important to consider marketoriented factors. So, I would want to do a customer impact analysis to identify any loss leaders and determine where carrying a full product line is necessary to compete. We also need to develop a transition plan to minimize unmet customer expectations as we cancel specific products. These analyses need to be done for each major channel, and on end-user impact as well.\nFinally, I would want to understand the impact of complexity reduction in the factories (production scheduling, capacity utilization issues, etc.)\nPotential pitfalls:\n\nBeing unable to explain why an analysis you suggest is important or how it could be executed.\nNot following your framework / jumping around in your structure without a clear plan of attack.\nGetting caught up in academic theory and losing sight of the practical application (e.g. accounting conventions).\nFailing to adjust your answer based on additional data provided by the interviewer.\nNot doing the math (as appropriate to the case)\n\nStep 5: Drive to recommendations\nInterviewer: “What actions would you recommend to the client?”, or, “Based on your analysis, what should the client do?”\nGood Response: (capacity utilization)\na. Specific and action-oriented:\n- “Given the situation with capacity utilization and the cost advantages in Mexico, Acme should close the New Jersey and Michigan plants and consolidate production in Chihuahua.”\nb. Realistic and pragmatic:\n- “The implementation timeframe for the plant closure is probably 8 to 12 months.”\nc. Acknowledge difficulties in implementing change:\n- “This will be a major change for the organization. We will need a carefully developed transition plan that considers the problem comprehensively: relationships with the union, customer impacts, changes in distribution and warehousing, public relations, and impact on the supplier base.”\nd. Sensitive to client capabilities, biases, politics:\n- “Right now there isn’t a strong central purchasing department. If we are going to shift from local to corporatewide sourcing with the plant consolidations, the client will have to invest in this capability.”\n- “Given what you’ve told me about the culture at this firm, this is likely to be highly controversial. We need to be careful how and when this is communicated to the organization.”\nPotential pitfalls:\nReluctance to make recommendations in the absence of perfect information\n- “I’d prefer to do more analysis first.”\nProviding a generic answer that doesn’t drive to specific client actions\n- “The client should increase capacity utilization.”\nUnrealistic / too optimistic:\n- “I don’t see how the union could be an obstacle.”\nIgnoring the client as relevant to solving the problem\n- “This is clearly the right answer, so I don’t think the COO’s objections are all that important.”\nKeys to the Case:\nThere are 5 background slides in this case. A large amount of data is presented up front, but the problem itself is not clearly stated. Thus, an important aspect of this case is for the candidate to quickly identify the critical issue(s) to be analyzed.\nThere is more than one framework that can be applied successfully in this case. The traditional revenue/cost breakdown approach will work, as will a 3C’s-oriented structure.\nRecognizing which factors the client can influence or control is key to developing a good hypothesis in this case.\nThe ultimate goal is to drive to specific, actionable recommendations for the client to improve profitability. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Little first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: consumer goods; food & beverages.\nCase Interview Question #00770: Our client Exotic Juices Company is a consumer packaged goods company located in Madrid, Spain. The company’s main business is to produce fruit pulp and extracts for manufacturing different flavored beverages. The business has been owned and managed by a Spanish family for several decades. It has revenues of 100 million Euros a year.\nThe client Exotic Juices Company sells its products through two major distribution channels: to restaurants and to retail stores such supermarkets. It has been facing a recurring problem of spoilage and has displayed higher spoilage rates as compared to its competitors. An Arthur D. Little case team has been engaged to help them solve this problem. What can be done to reduce their high spoilage rate?\nAdditional Information: (to be provided to candidate upon request)\n\nDistribution channels: wholesale suppliers to restaurants, supermarket private labels.\nShelf life of 180 days with customers requiring 60 days.\nHigh recipe switching costs.\nCompetitors’ spoilage rates are only one-fourth of our client’s.\nSpoilage occurring at the client’s distribution centers and not at the customers’ facilities.\nThe client’s capacity utilization is 80%.\n\nPossible Answer:\nQuestion #1: Lay out the end-to-end value chain\nSuggested Solution:\nDemand forecast –> Sourcing –> Manufacturing –> Sales & Distribution\nQuestion #2: Estimate the demand of pulp and extracts for our client\nAdditional Information: (Only Provide if Asked)\n1 gram of fruit extract is required per 200 ml of beverage (industry standard)\nTotal market size of the restaurant channel: 1.5 billion liters\nMarket share in the restaurant channel: 30%\nTotal market size of the supermarket channel: 750 million liters\nMarket share in the supermarket channel: 40%\nSuggested Solution:\nTotal demand for the client’s products:  (30% * 1.5 billion liters + 40% * 750 million liters) * 1 gram/200 ml = 3.75 million kilograms\nAdditional Information to be provided next to interviewee:\nThe client’s forecasting tools and methods are out dated and generate estimates that are not in tune with the current market demand. The tool generates production requirements of 4.9 million kilograms annually.\nThe interviewee should be asked for reaction and possible solutions:\nThe client over produces by 1.15 million kilograms which would contribute to the problem of excessive spoilage. The client also faces a severe problem of over-capacity. Candidate should suggest means by which capacity can be reduced (by selling off facilities) or effectively utilized (renting to other manufacturers, for instance).\nQuestion #3: Where else in the value chain could there be possibility of wastage or spoilage?\nSuggested Solution:\nIdeally the candidate should examine each step in the value chain:\n\n\n\n\nSourcing\nManufacturing\nSales & Distribution\n\n\nAdditional Information to be provided if asked\nThe client sources its raw materials from 3 main suppliers. In recent years relations with one of them has soured and consequently quality of raw materials has declined considerably.\nClient has recently refurbished its production equipment, installing the latest available technology.\n2 distribution centers: one in Barcelona and one in Sevilla. Some products have very low inventory turn overs exceeding the 180 day shelf life.\n\n\nInsight\nSpoilage could occur due to low quality of raw materials used. This in the long run can affect the client’s credibility in the market.  Re-evaluate available options and  consider changing suppliers.\nManufacturing does not directly contribute to spoilage but due to mistakes in demand forecast there is a problem of over production.\nRationalise product SKUs. Eliminate those with very low turn-over rates.\n\n\n\nConclusion:\nFinal recommendation should include a summary of all the problems analyzed with insights drawn from each clearly stated. Strong candidates will also include actions to be taken.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

I’d like to investigate how revenues and costs have changed to answer this question.\nBetter Answer:\nThe client has identified the decline in profitability as the most important issue.\n- I’d like to investigate how revenues and costs have changed over time to answer this question.\n- After we understand what has changed from a financial perspective, I’d like to look at how the customer base/preferences have changed in addition to competitive forces in the industry to understand the root cause of the client’s decline in profitability.\nPotential Pitfalls:\nIgnoring or missing key information presented up front\n- I think the most critical issue is determining how the client can grow their business.\nJumping to a conclusion without supporting data.\n- A decline in profitability must be due to their failure to control costs.\nFailing to summarize the situation and diving into a detailed data request\n- I’d like to look at the income statements for the past 8 quarters.\nStep 2: Specify an analytic framework\nInterviewer: “How would you approach this problem?”, or, “Specifically, what would be the key elements of your analysis?”\nUseful Frameworks:\nAfter identifying profitability as the key issue under consideration, the interviewee should be very explicit about how they would like to proceed to answer the question. There are two frameworks which an interviewee may find useful in this case:\na. Profitability Framework\nInterviewees who use this framework will quickly uncover that a decline in unit sales has caused a decline in revenue and will likely hypothesize that a failure to cover fixed costs is causing costs (as a percentage of sales) to increase.\nInterviewees who use this framework will be less likely to fully investigate the change in customer preferences or competitive landscape to which the client must respond.\nb. 3C’s\nUsers of this framework may have a more difficult time driving towards the sales decline and fixed cost leverage issues than those which use the profitability framework.\nHowever, the 3C’s framework is a great way to explore the customer and competitor issues here.\nPotential pitfalls:\nPicking an inappropriate framework. For instance, using Porter’s Five forces would indicate that the interviewee likely does not grasp the key issues in the case.\nNot fully exploring one portion of the framework before moving on / jumping around in your framework. For instance, asking about price, moving to COGS, then returning to sales volume and finishing with SG&A.\nStep 3: Prioritize/develop hypothesis\nInterviewer: “So, what issue would you pursue first?”, or, “Which do you think is the most leveraged area for analysis?”\nGood Response: (based on the profitability framework)\nWhen this question is asked, it is a sign that the interviewee has uncovered what has changed with respect to revenue and costs and is being prompted to suggest a line of analysis which will help them drive toward a recommendation.\n- I think the most important issue facing the client is the decline in unit sales which are responsible for the decrease in revenue. My hypothesis is that this decline in demand is responsible for a decrease in capacity utilization and/or leverage of other fixed costs which is ultimately responsible for the decline in profitability.\n- If nothing can be done to address the decline in unit sales (for instance, market-wide demand change), it will be necessary to aggressively manage costs to improve profitability. For this reason, I would next like to investigate the client’s major cost components.\nPotential Pitfalls:\nTouching on issues rather than driving to the essence of the case\n- “I’d like to know how much the company spent on advertising over the last year compared to other industry players”.\nFailing to directly answer the interviewer’s question\n- “How many other players are there in this industry?”\nStep 4: Structure/execute analysis\nInterviewer: “What analysis would you need to perform to address the issue?”, or, “How would you develop your hypothesis on reducing costs?”\nGood Response:\nHere, the interviewer is looking for specific analytics which would enable the case team to make an actionable, data-driven recommendation.\nOn the revenue side, I’d like to investigate why unit sales have fallen and on the cost side, I’d like to understand how our costs compare to those of competitors.\nIt is clear that falling unit sales are driving the decline in revenue. I’d like to understand whether a customer or competitor shift is driving this trend, or the market is simply contracting.\nI’d like to see how our market share has changed relative to other industry players. If everyone’s sales have declined, that implies a need to aggressively manage costs in the face of a shrinking market. On the other hand, if other competitors have gained share at our expense, I’d like to know why.\nI’d like to see what features or characteristics customers value most (especially price) and how our client stacks up with other industry players.\nI’d like to compare the client’s major cost elements with those of the other two competitors.\nPotential pitfalls:\nFailure to suggest an actionable course of analysis\n- “I’d like to understand why sales have declined”\n- Interviewer – “Ok, so what data do you want/how would you actually go about this?”\nSuggesting a course of analysis which will not directly lead to an answer for the key question in the case.\n- “First we need to estimate customer price elasticities for each service provided…”\nStep 5: Drive to recommendations\nInterviewer: “What actions would you recommend to the client?”, or, “Based on your analysis, what should the client do?”\nGood Response:\nAt this point, the interview is either running short or you have reached a point where you have all the information you need to present a recommendation to the client.\nThe root cause of the decline in profitability is that our client is offering the wrong set of products to customers. Specifically, customers now buy on price and reliability, not on product variety and repair capabilities. For our client to effectively reverse the trend in profitability, they should immediately do the following three things:\n- Reduce the number of products offered. Do this by looking at products with the lowest sales volumes and total gross margin contribution. The client should seriously consider keeping only those products which account for 80% of its sales or gross margin dollars. This will reduce manufacturing costs (COGS) and the overhead associated with managing such a large product line (SG&A).\n- I’d look next at the repair department to determine if costs could be removed from this area. The client OVS apparently has very strong capabilities in this area but customers do not appear to be willing to pay more for this.\n- The cost savings should be used to reduce price and improve delivery reliability in order to preserve their market share.\nPotential Pitfalls:\nMaking a recommendation which is not specific\n- “The client should cut costs”\n- Interviewer : “How?”\nMaking a recommendation which does not address the key issue facing the client\n- “I think they should consider using a pay-forperformance scheme to better motivate employees”\nMaking a recommendation with no factual support\n- “I think our client should invest more in advertising”\n- Interviewer : “Why?”\nQuestion Tree\nThe following tree illustrates how a candidate might use the profitability framework to work through the case.\nWhy have profits declined? Profits = Revenues – Costs = sales volume * unit price – (fixed costs + variable costs)\n1. How has revenue changed? How has unit price changed? How has sales volume changed? Is this decline in sales volume the result of a market trend or has a competitor been stealing share? Have competitors taken share by offering a superior value proposition or by cutting price? What attributes are most important to end customers? How does our client deliver on these attributes?\nRevenue Insights:\n\nOur client has the wrong cost/quality configuration.\nThey are perceived as dead last in the two categories listed as most important to end customers (price and delivery reliability).\nOur client’s perceived strengths (large product selection and repair services) are not particularly important to end customers.\n\n2. How has total cost changed? What are the key components of cost? How does each compare to competitor costs?\nCost Insights:\n\nOur client is at a cost disadvantage relative to other industry players.\nOur client does not have much flexibility to adjust price because of their high relative cost position.\nThe cost disadvantage comes primarily from SG&A and COGS implying inefficient manufacturing practices and high overhead relative to competitors.\nOur client OVS appears to be investing less in its delivery capabilities than competitors.\n\nKeys to the Case\nThere is only one background slide in this case (Situation / Complication). It is up to the interviewee to ask the right questions to uncover the data necessary to formulate a reasonable hypothesis. The additional data slides are then provided to the interviewee as data is requested.\nThere is more than one framework that can be applied successfully in this case. The traditional revenue/cost breakdown approach will work, as will a 3Cs-oriented structure.\nDue to the open-ended nature of the problem posed, the key to this case is to remain focused on addressing the client’s key question.\nThe ultimate goal is to drive to specific, actionable recommendations for the client to improve profitability.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: increase sale/revenue.\nConsulting Firm: Arthur D. Little first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: apparel, clothing, textiles.\nCase Interview Question #00769: Our client Coach, Inc. (NYSE: COH) is a luxury fashion company based in New York City, United States. The Coach company is well known for accessories and gifts for women, including handbags, shoes, small leather goods, footwear, outerwear, ready-to-wear, watches, travel accessories, scarves, sunwear, fragrance, jewelry, and other accessories.\nAs one of the premium manufacturers and sellers of women’s leather handbags and shoes in the U.S., the client Coach is among the leaders in the segment in which they operate (mid to premium). Recently, faced with increasing competition from other luxury brands, they wish to grow rapidly and have approached you for possible options. What would you recommend to the client?\nAdditional Information: (Provide the following info if requested by interviewee)\n\nGrowth Objective: the client Coach wants to increase revenues\nCompany: every Coach store is selling both handbags (80 sq. meters) and shoes (120 sq. meters),  and in addition the store also has non-revenue generating areas (such as the cash register), making the total size of each store slightly over 200 sq.meters.\nPosition in market: market leader\nMarket share: 40% of mid to high-end segment\nCompetitors: small and medium sized players\nDifferences in product portfolio: no significant difference\nCash/capital position: the client Coach has huge cash reserves at its disposal\nManufacturing strategy: Sourcing and manufacturing at low cost destinations. Designs are created at the company’s design studios in the U.S.\n\nPossible Answer:\nQuestion #1: What possible options do you have to increase revenue for the client?\nSuggested Solution:\nThe candidate’s framework should include but not necessarily be confined to the following options for revenue growth:\n\nExpanding customer base by attempting to enter either the ultra-premium or low end segments\nIncrease sales through marketing\nAcquisitions (acquisition of direct competitor in the relevant market segment vs. competitor in another customer segment, to quickly reach scale vs. acquisition in another product segment)\nLaunching new product categories\nInternational diversification\n\nCookies: Asking about the market share and cash position of the client company?\nTraps: Missing the usual growth strategies, failing to focus on the fact that client is focused on growing the top line.\nThe interviewee should then proceed to explore each of the following options and eliminate the ones which are inadequate based on the data provided during the discussion.\nOption 1: Expanding customer base by attempting to enter either the ultra-premium or low-end segments\nAdditional Information provided upon request:\nThe ultra-premium segment has strong players like LV, Gucci, Chanel, PradaR, YSL, etc, and the customer loyalty to the current brands is a major barrier to entry.\nThe client Coach has considered penetrating the low end segment, but is concerned that its positioning as a ‘premium luxury brand’ will be compromised and it would lose its existing customers.\nOption 2: Increase sales through marketing\nThe candidate should conclude from the data provided above that as the client already has a market share of 40%, marketing campaigns cannot lead to a major increase in sales.\nOption 3: Acquisitions (acquisition of direct competitor in relevant product segment in order to quickly reach scale vs. acquisition of competitor in another product segment)\nThe candidate should mention both advantages and disadvantages.\nAdditional Information provided upon request:\nThe client Coach had made a few acquisitions over the past few years but none of these have had the desired impact on revenues.\nInsight: Candidate should conclude that given historical precedents, acquisitions are not the best way to increase revenues for this client.\nOption 4: Launching new product categories\nAdditional Information provided upon request:\nThe client is considering launching 3 additional product categories: perfumes, sun glasses and wallets. They are not looking to expand retail area (open new stores or expand current stores) in the U.S. due to real-estate prices. If the new categories are introduced they would have to be adjusted within the display areas of the existing stores.\nOption 5: International diversification\nAdditional Information provided:\nThe client feels that they are highly dependent upon the U.S. market for revenue generation and would like to reduce this risk.\nInsight: The above information combined with the availability of huge cash reserves makes a strong case for international diversification.\nQuestion #2: Should they target existing customers i.e. women or should they also target men?\nSuggested Solution:\nCross-selling to an existing customer base is simpler. However, the candidate should be able to provide adequate supporting arguments for the option he or she recommends.\nQuestion #3: Given the following information how would you analyse the impact of launching new product categories? Please keep in mind the client company is not willing to expand its store size from the current size (slightly over 200 sq. meters).\nTip to Interviewee\nConsider that the sales to space ratio is 1:1, i.e. if handbags are to be sold, then the entire 80 sq. meter bag display space is continuous and no other products can be placed within this space.\nAdditional Information to be provided:\n\n\n\nProduct category\nDisplay space (sq. meter)\nUnit price ($)\nUnit sales/month\nRevenues/sq. meter\n\n\nBags\n80\n400\n2500\n400*2500/80 = 12500\n\n\nShoes\n120\n250\n2400\n250*2400/120 = 5000\n\n\nPerfume\n90\n100\n2700\n100*2700/90 = 3000\n\n\nSun glasses\n30\n150\n600\n150*600/30 = 3000\n\n\nWallets\n50\n110\n850\n110*850/50 = 1870\n\n\n\nSuggested Solution:\nBased on the above data (the first 3 columns), the interviewee should proceed to calculate Revenues/sq. meter (the last column) to derive the most optimal product mix for the current store size (approximately 200 sq. meters).\nInsight:\nCurrent product mix of bags (80 sq. meters) and shoes (120 sq. meters) generates the highest revenue per square metre of retail space. As the client is not willing to expand retail space, launching the 3 new categories (perfume, sun glasses, wallets) would decrease revenues.\nQuestion #4: When considering possible geographical locations for new stores or expansion, what factors would you consider?\nSuggested Solution:\nA Potter’s 5 Forces or PESTEL framework can be used.\nThe candidate should cover at least the following: market size, existing competition,  customers (income levels, buying patterns, level of awareness about luxury brands), legal and regulatory environment, availability of suppliers and distributors.\nImportant point: Manufacturing strategy. Will it be possible to centralize design functions at the head-quarters in the USA? An? sourcing and manufacturing viable in the target destinations?\nNote to interviewer: The candidate should be able to identify majority of these points though he/she is not expected to provide definite answers where sufficient background information is unavailable.\nQuestion #5: What are the possible options for new market entry or expansion and what are the pros and cons of each?\n Suggested Solution:\nThe candidate should cover all or most of the below points:\n\n\n\nMode of market entry\nPros\nCons\n\n\nJoint venture\nLess time consuming, leverage knowledge of local partner\nRevenue and margin sharing, reduced control\n\n\nAcquisition\nComplete control\nSynergies may be hard to find, cumbersome process, no knowledge of existing market conditions\n\n\nLicensing of brand to third party\nLow capital investment as licensee is responsible for managing supply chain and points of sale\nLack of control over licensee and high risk as inappropriate actions by licensee could harm the brand\n\n\nExport\nQuick and easy\nPrice inflation due to excise and customs duties\n\n\nOrganic growth\nComplete control, learnings from new markets\nHuge capital investment, high break-even point, availability of value chain partners, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: market entry, new market; market sizing.\nConsulting Firm: Boston Consulting Group (BCG) first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: sports, leisure & recreation.\nCase Interview Question #00772: Your client “24 Hour Fitness” is a privately owned and operated gym and fitness center chain in the United States. The company currently has over 4 million gym members and more than 420 clubs in 18 states. The corporate office is located in San Ramon, California and a processing center is located in Carlsbad, California. Its major competitors in the U.S. are Anytime Fitness, Gold’s Gym, Aspen Fitness, and LA Fitness.\nTo further grow their business, the CEO of 24 Hour Fitness wants to create an expansion plan in the U.K. According to a market research firm, the total market size of gym membership service in the U.K. is estimated to be approximately ￡2 billion per year. There are typically 2 types of gym segments in the U.K.: basic, premium. The client 24 Hour Fitness is considering targeting either segment. Is opening gyms in the U.K. a good idea for the client?\nPossible Answer:\nQuestion #1: What approach would you recommend to your client regarding entering the U.K. market?\nSuggested Solution:\n\nGain understanding of the UK market, as it is significantly different from U.S. market.\nUse synergies from the US market, such as: gym operations strategies, potentially using the same gym equipment suppliers or marketing firm, etc.\nFind excellent location: easy access and high visibility to target customers.\nMinimize capital investment and maintenance costs to increase ROI.\nClearly define the segment to target and then utilize specific marketing strategies geared towards the target segment in UK.\nIn an already saturated market, it’s key to offer a differentiated product, find untapped market space.\n\nQuestion #2: Is ￡2 billion per year an appropriate target market size for the gym segment (premium and basic) in the UK?\nSuggested Solution:\nSegment the total population of 64 million (population of the UK in 2014) as follows:\n1. Segment by age (assume lifespan of 0-80, and population is uniformly distributed), Calculate % of each segment that would be premium members (fact: 12% of total UK population are members of gym):\n\n0 – 10: 8 million, 0% premium and basic\n11 – 20: 8 million, 1% premium, 8% basic\n21 – 30: 8 million, 2% premium, 13% basic\n31 – 40: 8 million, 2% premium, 13% basic\n41 – 50: 8 million, 2% premium, 13% basic\n51 – 80: 24 million, 2% premium, 10% basic\n\n2. Calculate the number of gym members of each segment:\n\nPremium:  (8 M * 0.01) + (48 M * 0.02) = 1.04M\nBasic: (8 M * 0.08) + (24 M * 0.13) + (24 M * 0.1) = 6.16M\n\n3. Calculate average gym revenue:\n\nPremium membership: 60￡/month = 720￡/year\nBasic membership: 25￡/month = 300￡/year\n\n4. Calculate total revenue:\n\nPremium:  1.04M * 720￡ = ￡749 M\nBasic: 6.16M * 300￡ = ￡1848 M\n\nTotal: ￡749 M + ￡1848 M = ￡2.6 Billion\nQuestion #3: Is opening gyms in the U.K. an attractive option for the client?\nSuggested Solution:\n\nMarket size is large, however the client needs many physical locations to reach this market (high costs).\nHighly capital intensive industry (considering the client is opening up their own gym business and not franchise gym).\nLocation of gyms is key to attracting customers.\nOpportunity Cost: good ROI on the investment funds? May be better to use the investment funds to start another type of business, such as shopping mall, etc.\nCompetition: U.K. gym market is highly saturated.\nBrand: the client’s brand is not known in UK and brand awareness must be established.\n\nConclusion:\nNo, opening gyms in the UK is not a good idea for the client. Although the market is large, it is already highly saturated. In addition, there are few synergies that the company can transfer from the U.S. to the UK market. The client has a disadvantage to current UK market players.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The founders of the startup would like to start a new business in Germany: providing online food and beverage ordering service. You have been hired to evaluate the feasibility of the idea.\nThe Delivery Hero company would host a website which would list local restaurants with delivery services. The users would then use the Delivery Hero website to find restaurants in their area, usually filtered by cuisine and browse menus, read reviews and other information like the restaurant operating times and order takeaway food and beverage online. Payments can then be made by credit card, PayPal or with cash on delivery. The restaurants would then be responsible for arranging their own delivery service. The client Delivery Hero would attain revenues by charging a small commission fee to restaurants for every customer order from their website.\nIs this an attractive business? Why or why not?\nPossible Answer: \nQuestion #1: Estimate the market size of an online foods delivery service in Germany.\nAdditional Information: (only provide if asked)\nPopulation of Germany is approximately 80 million as of 2014.\nAverage price of each online food purchase: 12 Euro per order.\n% Population that buys food online (segment by age, location distribution)\n\nAge 0-10: approx. 0% (no money or capability to buy online)\nAge 10-20: approx. 20%, usage: 1 order every month\nAge 20-30: approx. 30%, usage: 1 order every 2 months\nAge 30-40: approx. 40%, usage: 1 order every 2 months\nAge 40-60: approx. 20%, usage: 1 order every 3 months\nAge 60-80: approx. 0%\n\nSuggested Solution:\na.

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new business; business competition, competitive response.\nConsulting Firm: Deloitte Consulting first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: transportation.\nCase Interview Question #00760: Your client LimoLiner is a Northeast-based luxury bus company that operates inter-city passenger buses along the Boston – DC corridor. The client has been in this market for over 40 years and has been reasonably profitable for most of that time. LimoLiner buses have larger leather seats with more legroom than typical intercity buses. In addition to a bathroom, the bus has an attendant and a small galley provisioned with free light snacks.\nIn recent years, the client LimoLiner’s market share and profitability have been declining. Looking at the competitive landscape, the CEO of LimoLiner recognizes that a number of low-cost, no-frills bus companies have entered the market. As a result of these new entrants and high gas prices, overall demand for inter-city bus services has been on the rise even as our client loses customers.\nThe client has hired us to determine whether they should launch their own low-cost bus line. And if so, how they should compete in this market?\nAdditional Information: (to be provided upon request)\n\nThe client LimoLiner targets a 40% gross margin for any new investments.\nThe overall inter-city bus services market is growing at about 5% per year.\nThe client LimoLiner’s two main routes are Boston – New York and New York – DC. There are 5-6 competitors on each route.\nThe low-cost bus lines (Lucky Star Bus, Fung Wah Bus, Yo! Bus, Bolt Bus, etc) typically operate out of Chinatown in the respective cities or pick up on the street (not in stations). They tend to use older equipment and have poor reputations for reliability and safety.\nThe client LimoLiner is struggling most with “first-time riders”, who tend to be younger, perhaps in college, and are riding inter-city buses for the first time. The client has a stable base of long-term customers where they have not seen much erosion.\n\nPossible Answer:\n1. Suggested Framework\nA good structure for this case would focus on profitability, but might also touch on issues of assessing the market, differentiation of the competitors, the client’s capabilities, and customer segmentation. Ideally, the case taker should ask if there are any metrics that the client focuses on before structuring the case, which would demonstrate that profitability is going to be the focus. You can allow the interviewee to pursue some other areas of investigation initially but try to guide them towards the profitability question eventually.\nWhile there could be a number of ways to look at profitability (and the interviewer should let the interviewee or case taker think through how to approach this), the case takes a simplified approach of looking at one bus operating on one route and assumes that this would be scalable across additional buses. The fictional data presented below is for the Boston-New York route. Feel free to make the math a little harder (e.g. bus makes 900 trips per year) if the interviewee needs to practice.\nOnce the interviewee has completed the profitability analysis, have them brainstorm responses for the second question of the case: How could the client effectively compete in this market?\n2. Analysis\nA. Breakdown of Revenue (data provided on request)\n\nThe client currently charges $40/one way on the Boston-New York City route\nLow cost competitors are currently charging an average price of $15/one way\nEach bus has capacity of 60 seats and estimated average utilization of 67%\n\nTotal revenue per one-way trip (new low-cost bus line) = $15 * 60 * 67% = $600\nB. Breakdown of Costs (Note: since our focus is on gross margin the interviewee can ignore SG&A costs)\nFixed Costs: (bus operates 330 days/year at 3 trips per day, thus ~1000 trips per year)\n\nBus: $250k (useful life of 10 years) = $25/trip\nO&M: $20k/year = $20/trip\nInsurance: $15k/year = $15/trip\n\nVariable Costs:\n\nLabor: 1 driver at a wage of $25/hour for 5 hours = $125/trip\nFuel: $4/gallon, 200 miles, 10 miles per gallon = $80/trip\nTolls: $75/trip\n\nC. Profits\n\nTotal Costs = $25 + $20 + $15 + $125 + $80 + $75 = $340/trip\nTotal Revenue = $600/trip\nProfits = $600 – $340 = $260\nProfit Margin = $260/$600 = 43.3%\n\nQuestion #2: How should the client compete in this market?\nPossible Answer:\nGood responses to this question should recognize that customers that take the proposed new low-cost bus lines are very price conscious and thus the client will have to compete on price (i.e. match competitors’ low prices). However, the client should look for how they can differentiate their product from the new competitors. Potential responses include:\n\nFocus on safety and reliability\nOffer additional amenities (e.g., Wi-Fi, music, movies, etc.)\nOffer food and drink service (bonus points if they mention this as an additional revenue opportunity)\nMore direct routes\nMore convenient pick-up locations\nLoyalty programs\nLeverage existing brand (Warning: This would likely hasten cannibalization and is not a good idea)\n\n3. Conclusion\nA. Recommendation\nThe client LimoLiner should launch their own low-cost bus line\n\nMeets gross profit target of 40%\nRoom for new competitor in growing market\nWill continue to lose customers if they do not act\n\nRisks:\n\nCannibalization of existing customers (This is a big one!)\nCompetitor Response: engaging in a price war with competitors that have lower costs\nRising fuel costs\n\nB. Next Steps\nPotential next steps include:\n\nIdentify opportunities to generate additional revenue sources in order to make up for lower profitability of new bus line\nConduct market study of “first time riders” to determine what additional amenities they would value the most\nDevelop retention strategy on existing bus service to minimize cannibalization\nDevelop distinctive branding strategy for new bus line\nLaunch pilot on one route to validate financial assumptions and test competitor response\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Barbados is a sovereign island country in the Caribbean Sea. With a population of about 282,000, the country is not quite as rich or as technologically developed as the United States. Currently about 50% of the Barbadian population has cell phones, and that percentage is increasing quickly.\nAs you look out your hotel room window the other day, you see a crew of workers from the Barbadian Telephone Company ripping out the pay phone on the street corner and replacing it with a new model. After putting your curiosity and your broken Spanish to use, you learn from the workers that they are not just installing a new model on this street corner, but replacing all 500 pay phones in the country with new models. You wonder why they are going through the time, trouble and expense when pay phones are obviously a dying technology and people are getting used to cell phones.\nSo, why are they replacing the pay phones?\nAdditional Information: (to be provided upon request)\nThe only significant difference in the new model of pay phone is that it is equipped to accept payment via prepaid phone cards that are available for sale in local convenience stores in addition to traditional payment with coins.\nPay phone service in Barbados has recently been de-regulated, but no competitors to the privatized former government monopoly have entered the market.\nThere is no government mandate to update pay phone technology.\nThe useful life of a pay phone (both old and new model) is 10 years.\nPossible Answer:\n1. Suggested Framework\nThis is a profitability case. The most direct approach to cracking the case is to compare the profitability of one old model pay phone with one new model pay phone.\nIf needed, the interviewer should encourage the candidate to list drivers of revenue and costs and consider how installation of the new model is likely to affect each driver. Potential drivers and effects are listed below. The interviewer should dismiss effects not listed. The key driver to identify is the reduction in maintenance costs. If needed, the interviewer should give the candidate hints until he/she identifies this effect.\nAfter the candidate has listed and considered both revenue and cost drivers, the interviewer should encourage the candidate to develop quantitative estimates of cost saving effects, providing guidance as needed. As outlined below, there will be no revenue changes.\nCompetition with cell phones and deregulation are red herrings. This is a case about the management of a stable business with slow or negative growth.\n2. Qualitative Analysis: Revenue & Cost Effects\nA. Revenue Drivers\n\n\n\nDriver\nPotential Effects of New Model\nExplanation\n\n\nCustomers per day\nNo change\nExtra payment option for customers without coins brings new customers, but offset by generally declining demand\n\n\nPrice per minute\nNo change\nSupply and demand not affected\n\n\nAverage length of call\nSlight increase, but not relevant\nCalls priced with flat fee for unlimited minutes\n\n\nAdvertising\nNo change\nNo additional ad space on new model\n\n\n\nB. Cost Drivers\n\n\n\nDriver\nPotential Effects of New Model\nExplanation\n\n\nInstallation\nSignificant increase\nOne-time installation fees will be substantial\n\n\nMaintenance\nSignificant decrease\nCompany won’t have to empty coins out of machine as frequently\n\n\nInterchange fees (fees paid to the owners of the phone lines)\nSlight increase, but insignificant\nWill increase average length of day increases, but not a big cost\n\n\nRent\nNo change\nValue of land unchanged\n\n\n\n3. Quantitative Analysis: Cost Savings (Illustrative)\nA. Breakdown of Costs\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\nMaintenance\nCosts (Useful Life)\n\n\nOld Model\n$0\n$1000/year\n$1000 * 10 years = $10,000\n\n\nAssumption\n\n$40/visit to unload quarters, 1 visit/2 weeks, 50 weeks/year\n\n\n\nNew Model\n$2200\n$250/year\n$2200 + $250*10 = $4700\n\n\nAssumption\nEquipment cost = $2000, 10 hours of labor @ $20/hour\n1 visit/8 weeks\n\n\n\n\nB. Total Cost Savings\nCost Savings per Phone * Total # of Phones = Total Cost Savings\n($10,000 – $4,700) * 500 = $2,650,000  (Assume discount rate of zero)\n4. Conclusion\nThe Barbadian Telephone Company is replacing its pay phones in order to save maintenance costs. Total cost savings are estimated to be ~$2.65 million.\n5. Additional Bonus Questions\ni. What is the most important assumption made in your analysis? (Reduction in number of visits to empty quarters because a significant number of consumers will change to prepaid phone cards).\nii. How could you test that assumption? (Customer survey, benchmarks from other industries that have shifted to cashless payment, install one new phone and run a pilot).\niii. If you were the CEO of the Barbadian Telephone Company, how would you spend your profits? (Dividends, new services, geographic expansion).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

So this might be the profitable segment to go after. Also, because electric vehicle technology is still new, customers in premium sedan segment might be willing to pay a premium for the eco-friendly factor, whereas customers in other segments may not put much emphasis on this aspect as they are more price sensitive.\n3. Conclusion\nA. Recommendation\n\nAfter doing the analysis, the client Tesla Motors should enter premium sedan segment for the following reasons:\nCompetition is low as addressable market size is 25%\nSegment profitability is high with $7,000 per unit profitability\nCustomers in premium sedan segment are more likely to pay a premium for the eco-friendly feature of our client model.\n\nB. Risks\n\nGetting the product right to suit the customer needs is necessary as the client Tesla Motors is already under financial pressure.\nThe client may not be able to service all the vehicles in the premium sedan segment as the segment is large. Relationships need to be established with service providers.\nAs the client Tesla Motors is still new in the market, establishing brand value is necessary, especially in the premium sedan  segment where brands like BMW, Mercedes, Lexus compete.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: merger and acquisition (M&A); private equity & investment.\nConsulting Firm: Bain & Company first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: tourism, hospitality, lodging.\nCase Interview Question #00762: Your client is InterContinental Hotels Group PLC (LSE: IHG, NYSE: IHG), a multinational hotels company headquartered in Denham, United Kingdom. Its brands include Candlewood Suites, Crowne Plaza, Even, Holiday Inn, Holiday Inn Express, Hotel Indigo,  Hualuxe, InterContinental and Staybridge Suites, etc.\nInterContinental Hotels Group owns and operates 4,600 hotels (with over 670,000 rooms in total) across over 100 countries, as well as a separate timeshare business with 75 properties worldwide. Their hotel rooms are typically sold on a per night basis, whereas their timeshare properties are sold more like traditional homes via a mortgage which in turn gives the buyer the right to stay at a timeshare property for a set period of time each year.\nThe year is 2011. The CEO of InterContinental Hotels Group has just approached you and has asked for guidance on whether or not they should spin off their timeshare business into a separate stand alone entity called Timeshare Co. What would you recommend?\nAdditional Information: (to be provided upon request)\nA timeshare is a property with a particular form of ownership or use rights. These properties are typically resort condominium units, in which multiple parties hold rights to use the property, and each sharer is allotted a period of time (typically one week and almost always the same time every year) in which they may use the property. Units may be on a partial ownership, lease, or “right to use” basis, in which the sharer holds no claim to ownership of the property.\nThe client InterContinental Hotels Group wants to weigh a few criteria, including the financial impact, risk, and strategic outlook.\nInterContinental Hotels Group only uses a five year time frame for all financial decisions.\nTimeshare Co. would be spun off and taken public, with 20% of the IPO proceeds being paid back to InterContinental Hotels Group. The remainder of IPO proceeds would go to Timeshare Co. and the underwriters.\nInterContinental Hotels Group’s bankers think they can sell 10 Million shares at $220 each.\nPossible Answer:\n1. Financial Impact\nQuestion #1: What is the financial decision making process for whether or not to spin off Timeshare Co.? Provide Exhibit 1 “Profit Projections” (the year is 2011) to candidate.\nExhibit 1: Timeshare Co. Historic and Projected Profits\n\n Possible Answer:\nThe candidate should notice that industry home sales are a good proxy for Timeshare Co.’s revenues, and forecast out five years of profits (2011-2015).\n\n2011 Forecast: -50M\n2012 Forecast: 0M\n2013 Forecast: 100M\n2014 Forecast: 150M\n2015 Forecast: 250M\n\nTotal 5 year forecast profits of Timeshare Co: -50 + 100 + 150 + 250 = 450M.\nPer the opening information, if spun off, InterContinental Hotels Group can expect 20% of the IPO proceeds. Bankers expect to IPO 10 Million shares at $220 each, or $2.2 Billion total. 20% of $2.2 Billion is $440M to be earned by InterContinental Hotels Group if they spin off Timeshare Co.\nBased on those amounts, it does not make financial sense to spin off Timeshare Co. ($440M if spun off versus five year projected revenues of $450M if kept in-house.)\nMitigation: $450M revenues are expectations and subject to a lot of risk and variability versus little to no risk if InterContinental Hotels Group just takes the IPO payment.\n2. Risk\nQuestions #2: What is the risk decision making process for whether or not to spin off Timeshare Co.? Provide Exhibit 2 “Mortgage Default Rates” and Exhibit 3 “Mortgage Portfolio’s Contribution to Profits” to candidate.\nExhibit 2: Mortgage Default Expectations\n\n\n\nYear\nDefault Rate\n\n\n2007\n1.5%\n\n\n2008\n8.5%\n\n\n2009\n11.0%\n\n\n2010\n9.5%\n\n\n2011*\n8.5%\n\n\n2012*\n6.0%\n\n\n2013*\n4.5%\n\n\n2014*\n4.7%\n\n\n2015*\n4.3%\n\n\n\nExhibit 3: Mortgage Portfolio’s Contribution to Profits\n\n\n\nYear\nPortion of Profits\n\n\n2007\n95.0%\n\n\n2008\n94.0%\n\n\n2009\n92.0%\n\n\n2010\n94.0%\n\n\n2011*\n95.0%\n\n\n2012*\n96.0%\n\n\n2013*\n95.0%\n\n\n2014*\n97.0%\n\n\n2015*\n96.0%\n\n\n\nPossible Answer:\nExhibit 2: the candidate should notice that default rates spiked in 2008/2009, and seem to remain much higher than in the past.\nExhibit 3: the candidate should notice how important mortgages are to overall success of business. Mortgage revenues always account for around 95% of total revenues.\nMain takeaway: Timeshare Co.’s revenues are risky given the variability of mortgage default rates, and it seems as though default rates will never return to pre-2008 levels. A “new low” seems to have been established around 4.5%.\nThus, it seems risky to keep Timeshare Co.’s business in house. The economic uncertainty with mortgage portfolios puts too much risk into InterContinental Hotels Group’s business. Spinning off Timeshare Co. would get rid of a lot of risk to InterContinental Hotels Group\nMitigation: While spinning off the business would be one way to achieve less risk, there are other options available to reduce risk from Timeshare Co, for instance:\n\nConnect timeshare buyers with mortgage companies and collect a finder’s fee instead of carrying mortgages in-house\nBuy mortgage default insurance to reduce volatility\n\n3. Conclusion\nA. Recommendation\nThe client InterContinental Hotels Group should spin off Timeshare Co.\n\nIPO proceeds are only slightly less than the 5-year expected profits, but profits are extremely volatile.\nIt also makes sense from a risk standpoint. While there are other ways to reduce risk, spinning off Timeshare Co. helps achieve a reduction in risk.\n\nB. Next Steps\n\nMust examine the impact of cross selling: How many timeshares are sold to hotel customers? How can we continue to cross sell after a spin off?\nMust consider other ways to reduce risks at Timeshare Co apart from simply spinning off the business.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Additional Questions to Steer Discussion\nAt some point near the start of the case, the interviewer (case giver) should take the lead and ask these questions after Exhibits has been given\nA. Exhibit 1: Would it be advisable to not cater to Medicare patients (assume no backlash)?\nB. Exhibit 2: What is the number of surgeries that Midwest needs to conduct in a year to breakeven?\nC. Exhibit 3: Why is Company D able to stay profitable despite having fewer patients and unfavorable patient mix?\n3. Suggested Solution and Structure\nA. On fully cost allocated basis Medicare patients are unprofitable but they are still paying $1K above the variable cost (marginal cost). This helps cover the fixed costs of the department. So, it is not recommended to stop conducting surgeries for Medicare patients.\nB. Average revenue per patient is 19K. Average variable cost is 14K. Gross margin per patient is 5K. Fixed costs are 7M, so 1400 surgeries are required for breakeven. Assuming same proportion as in Exhibit 1 the hospital requires 140 commercial, 420 insurance, and 840 Medicare patients.\nC. Company D might have a lower cost structure or are able to negotiate better pricing from payers.\n4. Conclusion\nA. Recommendation to Client\n\nIncrease total number of patients.\nChange mix of patients to have a higher proportion of commercial and insurance customers.\n\nB. Next Steps\n\nAnalyze scope for cost reduction, starting with competitive benchmarking.\nAnalyze scope for increase in price, starting with competitive benchmarking.\nAnalyze profitability of post care services provider.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The restaurant mostly serves government officials and high-level business customers. Its monthly revenue is RMB 1.2 Million Yuan, but profit is not very high. The manager of South Beauty 881 recently hired McKinsey & Company to help them increase profits. How would you go about this case? What recommendation would you give to the client?\nAdditional Information: (to be provided upon request)\nAs China’s economy is booming, the upscale dining market is growing at 20% every year.\nCustomers for high end dining are generally price insensitive.\nAll competitors are earning money. Competitors’ price and value proposition are similar.\nVariable costs across industry is 50% of revenue. Assume there are no fixed costs.\nOn weekdays, there is always a line of customers waiting for individual rooms at dinner time. As a result, the South Beauty 881 restaurant has to turn away half of its weekdays dinner customers due to capacity constraint.\nThe client South Beauty 881 has two kinds of seating in their dining area: 10 small private rooms with 2 tables per room, one big room with 20 tables.\na.

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: operations strategy, value chain; math problem.\nConsulting Firm: IBM Global Business Services (GBS) first round summer internship job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: Education & Training Services.\nCase Interview Question #00755: The Booth School of Business is a graduate business school located in Chicago, Illinois, at the University of Chicago. Formerly known as the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business, Booth is the second-oldest business school in the U.S., the first such school to offer an Executive MBA program, and the first to initiate a Ph.D. program in business. The school was renamed in 2008 following a $300 million endowment gift to the school by alumnus David G. Booth. US News, in the 2013 Best Business Schools ranking, ranked Chicago Booth 4th in the U.S.\nThe Booth School of Business is looking to promote its MBA program’s reputation and ranking position, by improving its on-campus summer internship employment stats. Currently, only 60% of Booth’s first year full-time MBA students secure an internship through on-campus recruiting. The Dean of Chicago Booth has hired our consulting firm to provide insight and recommendations on how to improve the on-campus offers. What would you recommend him to do?\nAdditional Information: (to be provided upon request)\nAssume that Booth School of Business has 500 full-time MBA students in each class.\nPush the interviewee to understand the “value chain” of on-campus recruiting (see below)\nWait for the interviewee to ask clarifying questions about specific objectives of this case:\n\nPrimary objective: increase on-campus internship offers to 75%.\nSecondary objective: the school administration is very cost sensitive and is only willing to spend up to $500K on this project.\n\nPossible Answer:\n1. Value Chain Analysis\nFirst, ask the interviewee to brainstorm the value chain for Booth to assist its first-year MBA students to get internship offers.\nData for current on-campus recruiting:\n\n# of companies that recruit on-campus = 100\naverage # of positions offered per company = 2\n# of interview slots per position = 15\nInterview success rate = 10%\n\n(assumption = each MBA student receives only one offer)\nThen, ask the interviewee to brainstorm on possible ways to increase the number of total offers made (he/she should go over the “value chain”)\nThe Booth school is looking into two possible strategies:\n\nIncrease the number of companies that recruit on campus\nImprove the interview success rate\n\n2. Quantitative Analysis\na. Increase the number of companies\nTo attract more companies to recruit on-campus, Booth’s Office of Career Services (OCS) needs to hire additional firm relations managers.\nEach manager can handle 5 companies and requires an annual salary of $75K. Additional costs (including travel, marketing expenses, etc.) per relations manager are estimated at $50K.\nTarget # of offers = 500 * 75% = 375\nCurrent # of offers = 500 * 60% = 300\n(375 – 300) / 300 = 25%\nThus, Booth needs to increase the number of companies recruiting on-campus by 25% * 100 = 25\n# of additional OCS firm relations managers needed = 25/5 = 5\nAnnual cost of firm relations managers = 5 * ($75K + $50K) = $625K\nb. Increase the interview success rate\nThe interviewer should have the interviewee brainstorm on possible ways to increase interview success rate.\nAccording to a recent survey, the most important factor in interview success rate is the number of mock interviews. For every 0.5% increase in interview success rate, Booth will need to hire 15 second-year MBA students as part-time mock interview counselors.\nEach second-year MBAs works 40 hours per month, with an hourly wage of 20$.\nRecruiting season lasts for 5 months.\nAlso, every 2% increase in interview success rate attracts 5 new companies that recruit on campus.\nThus, adding 2% in interview success rate:\n(100 + 5) companies * 2 offers per company * 15 interview slots per offer * (10% + 2%) success rate = 378 offers\nAnnual cost of second-year MBAs = 2%/0.5% * 15 MBAs * 40 hours per month * 5 months * 20$/hour = $240K\nNote: A good candidate will make sure that we have sufficient second-year MBA “Capacity”.\n3. Conclusion\na. Recommendation\nRecommend that Booth hires 60 additional second-year MBA students as part-time mock interview counselors. This will increase the total number of internship offers from 300 to 378 (meeting the goal of increasing on campus offers to 75%).\nb. Possible Risks (mitigation / next steps)\n\nDifficulty recruiting so many second-year MBA students (can even increase hourly wage up to $40 without exceeding target budget of $500K)\nEconomic downturn may cause companies to reduce the number of internship positions / slots.\nLimited # of study rooms at Booth to accommodate such an increase in the # of mock interviews (reach out to graduate school, law school, medical school, etc to get access to their rooms).\nWith so many second-year MBAs spending so much time on mock interview counseling, their grades may be negatively impacted, affecting the total Booth brand image (employ grade non disclosure policy).\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

But Dr. Rothman is a research scientist, not a businessman, and he has come to our consulting firm because he wants to sell the intellectual property rights to his Magic Eye Drops to a large pharmaceutical company that will have the resources to commercialize his invention. So, what should his asking price be?\nAdditional Information: (provided upon request)\nDr. Rothman has secured an exclusive, worldwide patent for the next 20 years. After the patent expires, generic versions will quickly be developed.\nObstacles to regulatory approval are not foreseen.\nThe Magic Eye Drops have no known side effects or risks.\nGive the candidate bonus points for identifying laser surgery as the closest competitor, but tell him/her to focus only on corrective lenses (glasses and contacts) as competitors for the purposes of this case.\nDirect the candidate to focus only on the U.S. market.\nPossible Answer:\n1. Suggested Framework\nThe interviewer or case giver should allow the candidate to build a framework. Help the candidate understand that this is a pricing & valuation case.\nThe candidate will develop a structure to estimate the Net Present Value (NPV) of future expected revenues and costs.\nTo develop revenue projections, the candidate will have to estimate the market size and the optimal price. An illustrative example of market sizing is given in the next section 2 “Market Sizing” and an estimate of revenue, including pricing, is given in section 3 “Pricing & Revenue”.\nMake the candidate brainstorm cost drivers. Once the candidate has listed all cost drivers, provide him/her with the figures listed on slide 4.\n2. Market Sizing\n\n\n\nAge Group\nPopulation\nRate of Sight Problems\nRate of Adoption\nMarket Size\n\n\n0-15\n50M\n20%\n10%\n1M\n\n\n16-30\n50M\n30%\n50%\n7.5M\n\n\n31-40\n50M\n40%\n50%\n10M\n\n\n41-60\n50M\n50%\n50%\n12.5M\n\n\n61-75\n50M\n60%\n40%\n12M\n\n\n75+\n50M\n75%\n20%\n7.5M\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n~50M\n\n\n\nGive the candidate bonus points for thoughtful and creative explanations of the assumed rate of sight problems and assumed rate of adoption within each segment (e.g., adoption among young and old patients will be lower because parents will be unwilling to test out a new technology on young children whose eyes are still changing and elderly patients with fewer years to live will realize fewer years of savings from not having to purchase new corrective lenses).\nGive the candidate bonus points for recognizing that the market will grow over the course of the 20 year patent. If the candidate raises this point, provide a projected annual growth rate of 3.5%. By the rule of 70, this means that the market will double before the patent expires, resulting in a true market estimate of 100M consumers.\n3. Pricing & Revenue\nThe candidate should weigh different pricing strategies: competitive, cost based and value based.\nOne pricing strategy is to use competitive pricing, using corrective lenses as the relevant competition. Based on personal experience, general knowledge or interviewer-provided information, the candidate should assume an annual cost of corrective lenses at about $200.\nRevenue over the life of the patent (20 years) can be calculated as shown below:\n\nMarket Size * Annual Value of Magic Eye Drops * Patent Life = Total Revenue\n~100M * $200 * 20 years = $400B\n\nThe candidate may suggest factors that alter the price point – such as convenience (suggesting a higher price point) and riskiness (suggesting a lower price point). The interviewer should accept reasonable alterations.\nThe solution’s assumption of 20 years of revenue assumes that all customers will purchase as soon as the product comes on the market. The candidate may reasonably adjust the years of revenue downward to account for some customers waiting several years before purchasing.\nMake sure that the candidate understands that we will disregard discount rates for the purposes of this case. In other words, assume a discount rate of 0%.\n4. Costs\nExhibit 1: List of Cost Driver\n\n\n\nCosts Driver\nCost\n\n\nManagement/Overhead\n33% of operating costs\n\n\nOperating Costs\n\n\n\nMarketing\n$150M per year for first 10 years, $50M per year for last 10 years\n\n\nProduction\n$20 per drop\n\n\nDistribution\n$100M per year\n\n\n\nCosts Calculations\n\n\n\nCosts Driver\nCost\nTotal\n\n\nMarketing\n$150M * 10 years + $50M * 10 years\n$2B\n\n\nProduction\n$20 per drop * 2 eyes * 50M customers\n$2B\n\n\nDistribution\n$100M * 20 years\n$2B\n\n\nOperating Costs\n\n$6B\n\n\nManagement/Overhead\n33% * $6B\n$2B\n\n\n\nTotal\n$8B\n\n\n\n5. Conclusion\nA. Recommendation\nDr. Rothman should put his invention up for sale at ~ $392B ($400B in Revenues – $8B in Costs). Sales could however continue even after expiry of the patent.\nThis solution has been simplified by assuming a discount rate of zero, because calculating the NPV for this case by hand would be overly complicated.\nB. Next Steps\n\nSolicit buyers: Focus on strategic acquirers\nAttempt to start a bidding war\nSpeak at conferences extolling the value\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: market entry; math problem.\nConsulting Firm: Oliver Wyman first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: Oil, Gas & Petroleum Industry.\nCase Interview Question #00757: Your client Murphy Oil Corporation (NYSE: MUR) is a large petroleum refining company that owns service stations. Murphy Oil produces oil and natural gas in the United States, Canada, Malaysia, the United Kingdom and Republic of the Congo and conducts exploration activities worldwide. The Company operates a growing retail marketing gasoline station chain, Murphy USA in the parking lots of Walmart Supercenters and at stand-alone locations in the United States.\nMurphy Oil Corporation is headquartered in El Dorado, Arkansas, and has over 8,600 employees worldwide. Recently, Murphy Oil is looking to expand its retail operation. The CEO of Murphy Oil has decided to enter the Northwest region and is looking to run a gas station in one of the main ports in Seattle, Washington. The CEO has hired you to determine how to proceed. What would you tell him?\nAdditional Information: (provided upon request)\n1. Market \n\nThe Seattle port is operating 24 hours per day.\nPort area is slowly growing because of consolidation occurring along Northwest ports.\nThere is no concrete information on full demand, but estimates place demand between 15,000-20,000 gallons of gasoline per day for the port.\n\n2. Competition\n\nThere are three existing gas stations in the vicinity. These stations are of equal size and capabilities.\nAll three gas stations are similar in location, operations, demand, etc.\nAll three stations are currently operating at full capacity.\nTwo of these three stations are owned by major corporations like Murphy Oil, and the third one is family owned.\n\n3. Investment\n\nMurphy Oil requires a 5-year payback on initial investment.\nDisregard cost of capital.\n\nPossible Answer:\n1. Suggested Framework\nA. Building a new gas station\nRevenue\n\nGas\nMinimart sales – the three existing stations in area do not have minimarts\n\nCosts\n\nInitial investment\nFixed costs: property, plant and equipment (PPE), maintenance, labor, utilities, marketing\nVariable costs: gas, minimart items\n\nB. Buying existing station – (do not mention this option to the candidate upfront)\nCan only buy the privately owned gas station; the other two are not for sale.\n2. Quantitative Analysis\nA. How much would a new gas station make per year? (provide additional info on request)\n\nNew gas station costs $650,000 in initial costs, and includes a minimart.\nNew gas station can sell 5,000 gallons per day.\nGas sells for $3.00 per gallon.\nGas station makes margin of 10 cents per gallon.\nAssume 300 business days in a year.\nCosts $250 to run the gas station (utilities, labor, etc.) per day.\n\nCalculation – Gasoline only:\nCalculation: $0.10 per gallon x 5000 gallons – $250 costs = $250 / day in profit.\n$250 x 300 = $75,000 profit per year on gas alone.\nCalculation – Including the minimart:\n\nOperating the minimart costs an additional $100 / day.\nDaily sales: $500\nDaily cost of merchandize for the gas station: $200\n\nCalculation: $500 – $200 – $100 = $200 / day in profit for minimart.\nTotal profit : $(250 + 200) / day x 300 days / year = $135,000 per year.\nIn five years: $135,000 x 5 = $675,000 -> Enough for payback (by $25,000)\nB. Purchasing the existing station\nThe owner of the family owned gas station is looking to sell his station and wants $530,000, but the station has no minimart. Building a minimart would cost an additional $130,000.\nThe gas station has the same capabilities as previously calculated (5000 gallons per day).\nGuidance for interviewer and additional information provided upon request\nIf the interviewee chooses to calculate breakeven with no minimart: $75,000 profit/year (see earlier) * 5 = $375,000, not enough to cover the $530,000 investment.\nWith the minimart, the station would earn $675,000 (see earlier) with a $530,000 + $130,000 = $660,000 initial investment, thus earning a $15,000 profit over 5 years.\nBased on numbers alone, the interviewee should conclude that building a new gas station is a better strategy. But purchasing the existing gas station may be the better decision (see below “Other factors to consider”).\n3. Other factors to consider\nDemand – although demand exceeds supply now, there may not be enough demand to support four stations. Therefore, buying a station is considerably safer in this instance.\nTiming – it would take longer to build a new gas station, thus favoring buying.\nCompetition – another company could buy the existing station, thus favoring buying now. Buying would also deter new entrants as there isn’t necessarily enough demand to support four stations.\nExpansion – could add more pumps to the existing station to support demand.\nMarketing – could sell more variety of products at the minimart. Adding a minimart could also drive traffic towards Murphy Oil’s station and away from competitors, although this would only be useful if Murphy Oil can expand.\nNext steps – closer analysis of demand to confirm that buying is a better idea than building a new station.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new business; math problem.\nConsulting Firm: Oliver Wyman first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: small business; retail.\nCase Interview Question #00758: After graduating from business school, you work as a consultant at Oliver Wyman. You have a friend who owns a single supermarket (mom & pop store) in the town of Ann Arbor, Michigan. This friend has called you for some free advice because you are an MBA and consultant. He says that he has noticed his supermarket competitors have recently added pharmacies to their stores and he is wondering whether or not he should do that himself.\nYour friend has some data sources and can provide you with whatever you need, but first he needs to know what data you need to help him make this decision. So, what kind of data would you tell your friend to gather? Should your friend add a pharmacy to his supermarket? Why, or why not?\nAdditional Information: (provided upon request)\n1. Investment Criteria \nBecause this is a small operation, your friend needs a payback of < 2 years (no discounting necessary).\n2. Customers\n\nHe has 10,000 unique customers every month.\nOn average, 50% of the local population have prescriptions.\nPeople who have prescriptions average 1 filling per month.\n\n3. Competitors\nThere are 2 Pharmacies and 2 Grocery Stores within 4 miles of his store.\n4. Revenues\n\nEach grocery customer spends an average $100/month at his store (assume 1 visit/month).\nEach prescription sale brings in revenue of $50.\nEach prescription customer tends to spend 40% more on groceries at the store.\n\n5. Costs\n\nInitial investment for adding a pharmacy: $1.2m.\nFor an added pharmacy, assume the costs of running a pharmacy are equal to 90% of revenue.\nCurrent grocery operations cost structure:\n\n50% Food / COGS\n10% Labor\n10% Fixed Overhead\n\n\n\nPossible Answer:\n1. Suggested Framework\nThis is a typical “adding a new business line” kind of case. The interview is meant to be conversational with the giver of the case to ask enough probing questions to keep the candidate on their toes and thinking through the problem.\nAdditional questions that help to steer discussion. Note: not all questions need to be asked if the candidate is leading the conversation.\n\nWhat is the population of the town/addressable market?\nWhat is the minimum market share needed to break even in 2 years? Is this reasonable?\nWhat are the two major costs of operation that the grocer will incur when opening a pharmacy?\nWhat margin do you asses for incremental grocery sales? (Only if the individual asks about revenue synergies)\n\n2. Quantitative Analysis\nA. Current market size estimate:\nBecause there are three Grocery Stores in the local market, estimate that the current market share of your friend’s grocery business at 30%.\n10,000 / 0.30 = Total unique customers each month = 33,000\n33,000 grocery customers * 3 people per household = Total Population = 100,000\nPharmacy market is then 100,000 * 50% = 50,000 customers\nOdds of each household containing at least 1 pharmacy customer = 1 – 0.5^3 = 87.5%\nThus, of your friend’s 10k grocery customers, 8,750 have prescription needs\nB. Incremental value of a pharmacy customer per year:\nProfit from grocery sales = $100 * 40% incremental sales * 30% profilt margin (1-50%-10%-10%) = $12\nProfit from drug sales = $50 * 10% profilt margin (1-90%) = $5\n($12 + $5)/month * 12 months = $204 per year\nC. To break even in 2 years:\n1.2m / ($204 * 2) = ~3,000 pharmacy customers\nYour friend only needs 3,000/8,750 = ~35% of the households who have prescriptions and currently shop at your friend’s store to break even in two year.\n3. Conclusion\nA. Recommendation\n\nYour friend should invest / expand to include a pharmacy because there is an extremely high likelihood that he will break even in less than two years.\nValue of a pharmacy customer is very high because of margin on drug sales and increased grocery sales in the store.\nOnly need 35% of his current grocery customers who have prescriptions to switch to his pharmacy to make it profitable.\n\nB. Next Steps\nSome suggestions:\n\nMake good design plans for the pharmacy\nGet a bank loan\nInterview pharmacists\nMarket the new service to customers\nContact drug reps / determine suppliers\nContact drug-store competitors to see if they want to do a joint venture or partnership because you will probably put them out of business.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: improve profitability.\nConsulting Firm: Deloitte Consulting first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: entertainment; mass media.\nCase Interview Question #00750: The client Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. (CPII) is an American film production and distribution studio headquartered in Culver City, California. As one of the leading film studios in the world, Columbia Pictures has several lines of business. They are particularly concerned about one part of their business which provides post-production services internally as well as for external customers.\nThis business division has experienced stagnating profits in the recent times. Therefore, they have hired your consulting firm to explore ways to address this problem, and increase the profitability of this business.\nThe postproduction services division of Columbia Pictures is comprised of four distinct products:\n\nRestoration of old films for preservation\nProduction of master prints for theaters and exhibition\nProduction of master copies for the home entertainment market\nProduction of daily material for review during ongoing film production\n\nIt is common in the movie industry to outsource these functions. However, based on the studio market research they know that their internal rates for these services are comparable to the market rates. The CFO of Columbia Pictures wants to know what strategic options he has to increase profitability. (Note: The interviewee should note that since there are no monetary benefits from outsourcing, it should not be a concern.)\nThe interviewer finishes presenting the case by asking the following questions:\n1. Which possible recommendations will you consider to each business unit?\n2. Which criteria would you use for the recommendations?\n3. What metrics would you use to determine the relative profitability of the four services?\nAdditional Information:\nThe interviewer should only provide the information in Exhibit 1 in response to the interviewee’s questions, and should also lead the interviewee to think about these main issues.\nExhibit 1: Main issues to consider (Not to share with interviewee, use for feedback)\n\n\n\nSERVICE\nCUSTOMERS\nISSUES\nTREND (Market)\n\n\nRestoration\nHome entertainment\nCustomers care about the quality of the services\nStable\n\n\nMaster Theater/Master Home\nNew Productions\nCustomers care about the quality and also the price of the services\nDecreasing in recent times\n\n\nDailies\nOn going Movie Productions\nThey care about the speed of the service\nStable\n\n\n\nSG&A costs have been stable and are shared among the service lines. A recent benchmark study has shown that these costs are consistent with industry norms.\nIf the interviewee asks for further financial information, provide Exhibits A and B from below.\nExhibit A – Revenues and COGS for Print Production Services\n\nExhibit B – Volume\n\n\n\nService\nNumber of Jobs  (most recent quarter)\n\n\nRestoration\n5\n\n\nMaster (Theatre)\n10\n\n\nMaster (Home Entertainment)\n40\n\n\nDailies\n10\n\n\nTotal\n65\n\n\n\nPossible Answer:\nThe interviewee should first try to answer the first question (Which possible recommendations will you consider to each business unit?) since it will help him/her structuring the following ones. Possible recommendations for each business unit are: expand, boost revenues (marketing), lower costs (operations), close, sell, spin-off, etc.\nFor the next question (Which criteria would you use for the recommendations?) the interviewee should consider criteria as: gross margin, market trend, nature of business (core/non core), percentage of revenues vs. total revenues of the business unit, ease of implementation of possible solutions, risk as in possible competition responses, etc.\nThe interviewee must calculate gross margins (Revenue – Cost)/Revenue by service using data provided on Exhibit A. Alternatively, the candidate can calculate revenues and costs per job based on the numbers given in Exhibits A & B, and then gross margin and profits to compare the profitability of the four services. Any attempt to compare based only on total revenues, or COGS, etc would be inaccurate and should be pointed out as such during feedback.\nThe use of Exhibit B in the analysis process should be pointed to the candidate at the end as unnecessary/ over complication (constructive feedback making him realize that in some occasions the interviewer intentionally provides misleading information).\nExhibit 2 below is provided as an aid for the interviewer to guide/follow up the interviewee’s process.\nExhibit 2: Profitability Data (Not to share with interviewee, use for feedback)\n\n\n\nService\nProfit Margin\nRecommendation\n\n\nRestoration\n1.1/2 = 55%\nKeep, Expand\n\n\nMaster Theatre\n0.7/3 = 23%\nKeep\n\n\nMaster Home\n0.5/5 = 10%\nExplore\n\n\nDailies\n0.8/2 = 40%\nKeep, Expand\n\n\n\nRemember: Profit Margin = (Revenue – Cost) / Revenue\nAfter computing the margins the candidate should add to this matrix all the above-mentioned dimensions by trying to classify every service according to his different criteria. This process should be interactive (problem solving with interviewer).\nNote: A strong candidate will consider the whole market when analyzing the recommendations. The risk inherent to every decision comes mainly from the market response.\nExample, deciding to close/sell/spin-off a service might lead to total loss since for instance the competitors may start to offer bundles of products which would lead the customers to choose them to take advantage of the discount rather then split their requests.\nKey Takeaways\nThe decision model should be consistent along the different services considering:\n(1) gross profit margin;\n(2) contribution to total revenues;\n(3) nature of service, core/ non-core;\n(4) ease of implementation/ risk\nRecommended Conclusion\nThe candidate should address all four of the questions provided at the beginning of the case and develop a framework that addresses the decision criteria for deciding what to do with each service line. Financial as well as strategic factors should be considered.\nThere is no one specific answer, but the recommendations should be grounded in reasonable conclusions derived from the financial data provided and sound calculations made by the interviewee.\nA strong candidate will address the SG&A allocation issue among the service lines to further complement the analysis carried out.\nThe recommendation should also include a risk analysis and implementation/next steps for the division.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

H&M exists in 53 countries and as of 2013 has more than 3,000 stores. It is ranked the second largest global clothing retailer, just behind Spain-based Inditex (parent company of ZARA).\nOur client H&M USA sells women’s apparel in the U.S. market. They are known as a low-cost competitor and sell their apparel through multiple outlets and retail stores. They are looking at several options to cut costs even further and they’d like our opinion on how they can do that.\nThe client H&M USA currently manufactures products in two plants, one in the U.S. (Ohio) and one in Guatemala. A third party vendor in China supplies the remainder of their demand. They are thinking of closing the U.S. plant and want us to determine if this is a good idea or not. If so, where should they move their operations to worldwide?\nPossible Answer:\nSeveral frameworks will work for this case. However, in the end this is mainly a “cost cutting” case, so at some point the interviewee should look at some sort of Cost/Benefit analysis by location and keep in mind what the client’s core competencies and strengths are.\n1. Suggested Framework\nA. The Company:\n\nCurrent state of sales: Growing or Shrinking? (The interviewee should ask this to get a feel for future productions needs.)\nWhat are their major cost drivers? (Labor, Materials, Shipping, etc. Let the interviewee come up with these on their own.)\nWhat is their product truly know for? (As said in the introduction, low-cost competitor.)\nAre they currently delivering that strength to their customers? (Yes)\nWhat are the risks in closing the US plant, aside from costs? (Lead the interviewee to come up with things like bad press, labor negotiations, closing costs, increased shipping costs, etc.)\n\nB. Revenues and Costs:\n\nWhat are the revenues and costs of their current US production facility in order to get a baseline on what closing the US plant will save them?\n\nC. Locations:\n\nNew Locations for the US production and do a Cost/Benefit analysis of each.\nOther locations besides current places? (Vietnam, India, Philippines, South America, etc.)\nOther vendors in China? (If the interviewee is stuck on getting more outsourcing from China since the client is already outsourcing there, draw their attention back to the costs in China compared to both the US and Guatemala.)\nOther plants in Guatemala? (Go to Part #2)\n\nPart #1: Current State Analysis:\n\nAll three production sites produce completely equivalent product. There are no quality issues or differences between US, Guatemala, and China production.\nThe US plant is over 15 years old. Its equipment is old and fully depreciated. Maintenance costs have been increasing significantly the last few years as the equipment continues to age.\nThe Guatemala plant is relatively new and in good shape.\n\nThe Interviewee should ask for the following pieces of data. This data should only be given when asked for. The interviewee should be able to construct an organized table like the one shown below (Table 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOSTS ($ per unit)\n\n\n\nPlant\nCurrent Production\nTotal Capacity\nManufacturing Costs\nDistribution Costs\nTariffs\n\n\nU.S.\n125,000\n150,000\n$6.00\n$0.50\n$0.00\n\n\nGuatemala\n40,000\n50,000\n$4.00\n$1.00\n$0.50\n\n\nChina\n35,000\n40,000\n$3.00\n$2.00\n$2.00\n\n\n\nPart #2: Alternate production Possibilities\n\nThere are 10 other apparel manufacturers with plants in Guatemala.\nHalf of the 10 plants have approximately 1/3 excess capacity each.\nUsing this excess capacity would result in nearly the same costs as the client currently gets from their own Guatemalan plant.\nThe 5 plants with capacity break down as follows:\n\nP1: 10K units excess capacity,\nP2: 20K\nP3: 15K\nP4: 25K\nP5: 10K\n\n\n\n2. Analysis\nFirst, the interviewee should construct a table resembling the one shown in the earlier section (Table 1).\nPart #1: Current State Analysis\nThe Interviewee should calculate\n(A) Total costs per product per supplier:\n\nThe Chinese vendor is the most costly at $7.00/unit\nThe US pant currently costs $6.50/unit\nGuatemala plant is the lease expensive at $5.50/unit\n\n(B) If the US plant is closed, its 125K units of production cannot be accommodated by Guatemala and China. The other two production sites (Guatemala and China) can currently accommodate only (10K + 5K = 15K) units from the US.\nPart #2: Alternate Production Possibilities\nThe next step is to ask the Interviewee where they would find the excess capacity to account for the lost US production of 125K units. Answers could include:\n\nexpanding the Guatemala plant,\nleveraging the contact in China to find new outsourcing resources,\nlooking at other apparel plants in Guatemala for their excess capacity,\nseeing outsourcers in other emerging markets (Vietnam, India, Philippines, South America, Etc)\n\nIf the interviewee is stuck on getting more outsourcing from China since the client is already outsourcing there, draw their attention back to the costs in China compared to both the US and Guatemala.\n(C) The interviewee should calculate how much capacity the five other plants in Guatemala can provide:\n10K + 20K + 15K + 25K + 10K = 80K units’ total of excess capacity\n(D) Determine if this excess capacity is enough to handle completely closing the US plant:\n(125K units from US) – (15K units placed in current production locations) – (80K units placed in other Guatemalan plants) = 30K units remaining to be placed.\nRecommended Conclusion\nSuggested recommendations to the CEO: Close the US plant and move as much production as you can to Guatemala.\nHowever, what are the risks upsides with closing the plant?\n(1) Retire old equipment and save excess maintenance costs (case is clear about this one).\n(2) Profit from sale of the plant building? Are there any dollars from selling the building that can be redirected to Guatemala? It does not have to be specific, but should come up in discussion.\nAn example summary:\nAfter examining the costs of producing at your US plant, your Guatemala plant and your current China outsourcing arrangement, we feel it would be beneficial to close your US Plant. Even though this may produce some bad press in the US, your costs are much less elsewhere. Specifically, your Guatemala plant has low costs and we recommend moving all of your operations there.\nWe realize that your current plant arrangement cannot handle all of the US production, so we recommend retrofitting your Guatemala plant to handle approx half the US capacity, and source the remaining half from other manufacturing sites in Guatemala. During the year that the plant is being retrofitted capacity can either be bought from other vendors in Guatemala, at a premium, or do phased closing of the US plant to handle the leftover production. A study on the costs of retrofitting the plant vs. purchasing additional production from vendors would need to be undertake and we would be happy to help you with that.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

No other information regarding the baby dinosaur is available.\nThe candidate should layout some initial decision tree that could include:\n\nTake Action: run, call 911, call family or friends for help, pick up a stick to hit it with, stay there and cry, etc.\nTake No-action: Dinosaur leaves on its own, Dinosaur is friendly, Dinosaur is not friendly and you may die.\n\nIf the baby dinosaur is friendly, the candidate should think of ways to monetize it.\nPossible Answer:\n1. Structure to Steer Discussion\nA strong candidate will be able to structure their thought process to include the following issues:\n\nShould they approach the dinosaur or run away? (depends on whether it is friendly).\nWhat can they do with the dinosaur? (Monetizing activities, vs. non-monetizing activities such as research, etc).\nWhen monetizing the dinosaur, they should consider selling vs. building a dinosaur business/franchise.\n\n2. Questions for the candidate\nA. What are possible ways to monetize or make money in this situation?\nSell it, or create business around it. The candidate should brainstorm possible ways to create a business like using it for a movie, leasing it to a zoo or an entertainment show, or creating an ecosystem around the dinosaur like a theme park.\nB. What would you prefer to do, sell the dinosaur or use it for a business? Why? What are the possible costs and revenues you can generate in each case?\nC. What are the potential risks in this situation?\n\nDinosaur dies\nDinosaur attacks/eats spectators\nGovernment seizes dinosaur and claims right to it\nEnvironmental concerns, etc.\n\nD. What are the possible ways to hedge against the possibility of dinosaur death?\nInsurance, clone the dinosaur, asking science experts in field for ways to take care of it, create an ecosystem around Dinosaur like a theme park or having it star a movie.\n3. Recommendation\nA good recommendation for this case will include creating an ecosystem around the Dinosaur such as a theme or entertainment park. It will touch on other ways to hedge against the death of the baby dinosaur, and potential risks like legal or environmental risks.\nThe next steps may include conducting a feasibility study around creating an ecosystem/theme park.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The company was founded in 1962 and currently is the third largest discount store chain in the world, just behind Walmart (NYSE: WMT) and Target (NYSE: TG).\nHeadquartered in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, United States, the client company operates a total of 1,221 Kmart stores in 49 states, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands as of 2013, including 1,196 discount stores averaging 94,000 sq ft, and 25 Super Centers averaging 168,000 sq ft. Each store receives one delivery per day from a distribution center. The CEO of Kmart has hired your consulting firm to investigate if the costs related to distribution can be reduced. How would you approach this case? What recommendations would you give to the CEO of Kmart?\nAdditional Information: (to be provided to candidate upon request)\nThe client Kmart owns multiple distribution centers (DCs) across the United States. (Show figure below) \n\nThe 4 primary distribution centers are located in New York City, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco. The 20 secondary distribution centers are also spread out through the country.\nAll of Kmart’s products are imported from Asia and arrive daily at the San Francisco distribution center.\nThis case is mostly about qualitative analysis. Steer the candidate away from attempting any numerical calculations.\nPossible Answer:\n1. Analysis (Wait for candidate to specifically ask about these aspects.)\nA. Current Distribution Routes\n\nEvery day, trucks transport products from the San Francisco center to each of the primary and secondary distribution centers.\nTrucks from each of the primary DCs also make daily deliveries to the nearby secondary DCs.\nEach secondary DC makes one delivery per day to its assigned stores.\nAll routes to and from the DCs are the same each day regardless of demand (static routing).\nTrucks are rented and are of uniform size.\n\nB. Capacity\n\nNot all distribution centers (primary or secondary) are at full capacity. The three primary distribution centers (excluding the West Coast DCs) are well under capacity.\nMost trucks are NOT at full capacity.\nDemand for products is not the same at all stores.\n\n2. Sample Recommendations\n\nDeliver from the West Coast DC to the other primary DCs and secondary DCs on the West Coast. Do not deliver from West Coast DC to other secondary DCs.\nConsolidate secondary DCs that are not at full capacity.\nDetermine optimal routes to and from the DCs.\nDynamic Routing – do not make daily deliveries to stores/DCs if there is low demand, or keep some extra inventory at the stores.\nConsolidate trucks:\n\nUse smaller trucks if it decreases the cost.\nBuy trucks instead of renting.\n\n\n\n3. Sample Risks and Next Steps\nA. Risks\n\nOther primary DCs may not have enough capacity to hold the additional inventory.\nBy consolidating secondary DCs, capacity risks are magnified if demand increases drastically.\n\nB. Next Steps\n\nDetermine capacities of different DCs to see which trucks to consolidate.\nDetermine differences in demand of different stores.\nInvestigate trucking contracts and if using different truck sizes or buying trucks would save money.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Kearney first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: transportation; freight delivery, shipping services.\nCase Interview Question #00753: FedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX) is an American global courier delivery services company headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee. For this case, our client is FedEx Ground, a subsidiary company of the FedEx Corporation that focuses on ground transportation of commercial freight. Headquartered in Moon Township, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh, FedEx Ground provides 1-5 day delivery of small packages to all 50 states, plus Canada.\nFor the past 15 years, the client FedEx Ground has been using diesel engines to power its fleet of vehicles, but now wants to explore the possibility of switching to electric powered engines (EV technology) due to rising fuel costs. The CEO of FedEx Ground has approached us for guidance and wants to know how to proceed. What would you tell him?\nAdditional Information: (provided upon request) \n\nOur client FedEx Ground has identified a supplier to provide the electric vehicle (EV) technology since it does not have in-house capabilities.\nSince it has an extensive fleet of vehicles, our client FedEx Ground wants to retrofit existing vehicles instead of buying new ones.\nNo other ground transportation company has used EV powered engines. If our client proceeds with the conversion, it will be the first in the industry to do so.\nThe candidate should ask questions about the current costs of transportation and determine potential cost savings.\n\nPossible Answer:\n1. Overall Guidance\nThe candidate should explain his/her overall framework, then identify that the current and future costs of ground transportation will determine feasibility of project.\nThe candidate should then ask questions to determine the initial investment required for EV retrofitting and consider this cost along with the cost savings of the entire project.\nCandidate can assume that the current supplier offers the best EV opportunity in terms of price and efficiency.\nEV technology has the potential to double existing fuel efficiency.\n2. Suggested Framework\na. Revenue\nExplore impact on revenue (e.g. improved business relationships due to sustainable operations or reduced carbon footprint in supply chain for partners).\nb. Costs\nLabor, insurance, fuel, maintenance, retrofit initial investment.\nc. Competition/Industry\nNew technology may create competitive advantage for the client, thereby growing its business.\nFailure to properly implement fleet could disable operations, allowing competitors to take over.\nd. Existing Capability\nThe client FedEx Ground has no knowledge of using EV technology, requiring a learning curve.\nFirst to test the new technology may also pose a risk.\n3. Analysis\nA. Breakdown of Current Costs and Future Costs\nProvide the following cost data (Table 1) as the right questions are asked but do not give them away freely. Of the costs listed below, ask the candidate which would change and why.\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Costs\nFuture Costs\n\n\n# of vehicles:\n2000\n2000\n\n\nFuel tank size:\n50 gallons\n50 gallons\n\n\nAverage MPG (miles per gallon):\n10\n20\n\n\nCost of fuel per gallon:\n$3.00\n$3.00\n\n\nAverage miles travelled per week:\n1000\n1000\n\n\nAverage annual maintenance and repair:\n$500\n$3500\n\n\nInsurance:\n$1K/year\n3K/year\n\n\nLabor:\n$20K/year\n$20K/year\n\n\n\nB. Calculations of Fuel Savings\nb.I. Current fuel costs\n\nMiles driven per tank = 10 mpg * 50 gallons = 500 miles\nMiles traveled per week = 1000 miles\n# of times tank is filled per week = 1000 miles / 500 miles = 2\nTotal cost of fuel per week = 2 * 50 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $300\nAverage yearly fuel costs (~50 weeks) = $300/week * 50 weeks = $15K\n\nb.II. Future fuel costs. The candidate can perform calculations again, or receives a bonus for realizing that doubling fuel efficiency (from 10 mpg to 20 mpg) reduces fuel costs by half for the year.\n\nMiles driven per tank = 20 mpg * 50 gallons = 1000 miles\nMiles traveled per week = 1000 miles\n# of times tank is filled per week = 1000 miles / 1000 miles = 1\nTotal cost of fuel per week = 50 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $150\nAverage yearly fuel costs (~50 weeks) = $150/week * 50 weeks = $7.5K\n\nb.III. Annual fuel savings per vehicle: $15K – $7.5K = $7.5K\nC. Breakdown of Total current costs and Total future costs\n\n\n\n\nTotal current costs\nTotal future costs\n\n\nFuel:\n$15K\n$7.5K\n\n\nAnnual maintenance:\n$500\n$3500\n\n\nLabor:\n$20K / year\n$20K / year\n\n\nInsurance:\n$1K / year\n$3K / year\n\n\nTotal:\n$36.5K\n$34K\n\n\n\n\nSwitching to EV thus saves $36.5 – $34 = $2.5K per year.\nThe current vehicles have a remaining useful life of 10 years.\nThus, switching to EV saves: $2.5K * 10 – $5K (retrofit cost) = $20K over the lifetime of each vehicle (10 years).\nAt a fleet level, this would save the company $20K * 2000 vehicles = $40M over the lifetime of the vehicles.\nThe candidate can ignore time value of money/discounting, but should receive bonus points for considering it.\n\n4. Conclusion\na. Recommendation\nGiven the existing data, our client FedEx Ground should proceed with retrofitting its vehicle fleet to EV since it would save 40M over their remaining useful life.\nb. Risks\n\nOur client FedEx Ground would be the first in the industry to use EV technology, therefore its effectiveness in commercial transportation is untested.\nThe vehicles need to commute 1000 miles per week and current EV technology is limited to short range use.\nThere are limited recharging stations in the US.\nThere may be other unanticipated costs to using the new technology.\n\nc. Next Steps\n\nWork with suppliers to test the effectiveness of the new technology.\nRun a pilot test to determine whether EV technology works and does not negatively impact normal transportation operations.\nGain input from drivers on efficacy of EV technology.\nPerform research to determine whether there are government incentives for EV adoption.\nPerform research to determine whether EV adoption grows customer base/revenue.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new business\nConsulting Firm: Capital One first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: financial services; property, real estate.\nCase Interview Question #00740: The client is Cheung Kong Holdings Limited, an East Asian development company headquartered in Hong Kong. Cheung Kong Holdings is one of the largest developers of residential, office, retail, industrial and hotel properties in Hong Kong. With its long history of property development expertise and residential estates, Cheung Kong Holdings has built many of Hong Kong’s most notable landmark buildings and complexes.\nRecently, Cheung Kong Holdings sold off its U.S. division in the property services business, which used to make USD $100M a year in pretax earnings (EBIT). The CEO of Cheung Kong Holdings is looking to replace these lost profits by looking at real estate investment management business. The CEO wants to know if you can replace these lost profits ($100M a year pretax), how much money to raise for the investment fund, and if it’s a good fit for the business. How would you go about this case?\nAdditional Information: (to be provided to the candidate when requested) \nDo you know what the real estate investment management business is?\n(Quick explanation) The fund managers create fund. Investors invest in it. Investments are real estate assets. The fund makes money on a “2/20″ rule. 2% of assets under management (AUM) are paid to the fund management company every year and then 20% of excess returns are paid to the management company. This 20% is only applicable to “excess returns”.\nThey benchmark against anything, probably S&P index or other applicable industry index, and the fund management company gets anything above the industry/index average. For example, S&P is 8%, so the fund management firm gets 20% of 2% if the fund returns 10%.\nPossible Answer:\n1. What areas to explore?\nFour different areas from a chart:\n\nInvestors\nFund\nProperties\nFirm\n\nFirst and foremost, you will need to focus on the investors. Investors invest their money to your fund, and those revenues from your fund need to contribute to the 2/20 that will make up the $100 M in lost profits. The 2/20 must equal or exceed $100M in lost profits. In addition, you will need to focus on what talent you need to get these investors, what investors you’ll need (if they exist), and how to structure the firm to get these later.\n2. How much money to raise?\nOnce you get into that, then you have to figure out the amount of assets under management (AUM) necessary to make $100 M pretax. You will need to get costs, which is found to be 60% of the revenues. So the total revenue needs to be $100 M / 40% = $250 M. Then you will need to understand what are standard returns and what are our expected returns. Typical standard returns are 10% a year and our expected returns are 20%, so the excess returns are 10%. So now we have:\n2% * (AUM) + 20% * (AUM * 10%) = $250 M\nAUM = $6.25 B\n3. Soft portion of the case:\n\nwhat talent is needed to create the fund and solicit investors\nwhat real estate assets to invest in\nhow to handle international barrier\nother than money what to offer.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

O’Reilly Media was established by Tim O’Reilly and it publishes information technology related books and Web sites and  produces conferences on computer technology topics.\nFor this case, you have 20 minutes to prepare a Powerpoint presentation to give to Tim O’Reilly, the CEO of O’Reilly Media. The client has the number 1 electronic components catalog. This catalog is distributed at no cost to product designers. Revenues come from ads in the catalog. The CEO has noticed that revenues have declined 60% year over year. The CEO feels that because of the quality of the product, they are a content service provider. He is interested in converting the electronic components catalog into an online publication. He has come to you to determine if this new business makes sense and how he should market it. What would you tell him?\nAdditional Information: (Provide the following information if requested by the interviewee.)\n1. Company and Product \nThe client company has complete editorial freedom, so they aren’t tied to the products they advertise.\nThe content is used by designers to determine specifications of electronic components that may be used in product designs. This information is well-respected in the industry and typically seen as valuable to developers.\nThe client company would not get as much ad revenue from an online product, because advertisers would not pay as much for online ads.\nIf they went online, they would have to change to a subscription or pay-wall model, meaning developers would have to pay to access the information. Questions: would the customers be interested in paying? How much would you charge the developers for access to specification information?\nBecause it’s online, the information will have to be updated more frequently. The inventory needs of developers can be relayed to manufacturers, which may be valuable.\nWe are first to market.\n2. Competitions\nThere are two competitors in online space:\nCompetitor A: had been in the business for 2 years with 75% market share. Electronics distributor. Reliability of their information was questionable. They had a lot of data and access to OEMs, but because they are an electronics distributor they had conflicts of interests and there were questions about their ability to objectively provide product information and recommendations.\nCompetitor B: had been in the business for 1 year with 25% market share. The same data as we have, but at a higher price point than us. They also lacked functionality of our client. Our client had more robust search capabilities.\nPossible Answer:\n1. Framework\na. Market Entry\n\nWho’s already there?\nWhat are competitors doing?\n\nb. Capabilities\n\nStaff\nFunding\nSales force\nMarketing efforts\n\n2. Recommendation\nBased on the client’s core competency not being violated by changing their business model, it’s just being converted and it’s not drastically different from their core competency. Providing valuable information to their customers. They are differentiated enough to enter the space quickly and gain market share. They should enter the market.\nPart #2: The consulting partner made the recommendation, and the client company said they would move forward if they could recover a $6M initial investment within 3 years. What are things that they will have to consider? Are they going to make their money back in 3 years?\nGraph: Projected Total Annual Revenues and Operating Income for this Online Electronic Components Catalog Business\n\n\n\n\nYear 1\nYear 2\nYear 3\n\n\nRevenues:\n120M\n160M\n240M\n\n\nOperating Income:\n110M\n80M\n40M\n\n\n\nWhat was the client’s estimated market share? 15% for each year.\nOperating Margin: The client is estimated to have 10% operating margin.\nPossible Answer:\nAnnual Revenues of the client:\n\n$120 M * 15% = 18M first year\n$160 M * 15% = 24M second year\n$240 M * 15% = 36M third year\n\nOperating Income of the client:\n(18M + 24M +36M) * 10% = 7.8M over three years, which is greater than the $6M initial investment, so the client should move forward with the project.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: merger and acquisition (M&A).\nConsulting Firm: McKinsey & Company first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: food & beverages; tobacco & alcohol.\nCase Interview Question #00741: The client Fomento Económico Mexicano, S.A.B. de C.V., doing business as FEMSA (BMV: FEMSA, NYSE: FMX), is the largest beverage company in Mexico and in Latin America. Headquartered in Monterrey, Mexico, FEMSA is also the largest independent Coca Cola bottler in the world as of September 2011.\nFor this case, FEMSA is interested in selling its beer business to Heinekin or SAB Miller. FEMSA is based mostly in Mexico. Should FEMSA go ahead to sell its beer business? Why or why not? Don’t focus on the price of the transaction, but focus on the strategic view of the case.\nAdditional Information:   (Provide the following information if requested by the interviewee.)\nFEMSA is consumer goods centric with three major business units:\nThe first division is Beer with $3 B in annual revenue. Its beer division has 7 – 8 brands. 75% of the total revenue is  produced in Mexico and the other 25% is in US. They have famous brands such as Dos Equis, Tecate, and Sol. They’ve seen 3% – 5% growth, which is in line with their mature market. Their biggest competitor is Modelo who has been more profitable. Modelo (manufacturer of Corona beer) has a 55% market share and FEMSA has 45%. 50% of Modelo’s revenues comes from Corona. FEMSA has 20% operating margins. Although this market is a duopoly, the two players FEMSA and Modelo have tried to avoid price wars, so they are cooperating to a degree, but not a ton.\nThe second division is CocaCola FEMSA. This is the bottling facility for Coca Cola. It’s the largest in Latin America and the second largest in the world with $7 B in annual revenue. This division is the fastest growing business within FEMSA. CocaCola FEMSA has made lots of acquisitions and has had strong organic growth. Needless to say, this division is highly profitable.\nThe third business is FEMSA Retail ($4 B in revenue), which consists of a chain of convenience stores similar to 7-11. FEMSA Retail is the most dominate player in the market, and it has very fast growth, ~30% a year. As it typical of the retail world, FEMSA Retail’s margins are slim. They’ve managed to obtain a 6% margin, which is above industry average.\nIn the last 10 – 15 years, there have been lots of mergers and acquisitions in the beer industry. The three major players in the beer industry are SAB Miller, Imbev, and Heinekin. Local brands tend to dominate only in local markets. There is strong emotional aspect to local brands, but most brands are moving toward a global reach. Typically this is because there’s sourcing, manufacturing, and distribution synergies that help. At this point you are free to choose the side of FEMSA or Heinekin. Let me know what you choose and what you would advise the client.\nPossible Answer:\nI chose FEMSA, based only on the fact that the interviewer had tons of information regarding FEMSA.\nI asked whether FEMSA is public or private. It turns out FEMSA is publicly traded. That changes the equation and how the CEO can approach this case.\nFive buckets that will have an impact on share price:\n\ncompetition\nstrategic\noperational\ninvestment options\ndiversification premium\n\nWithin Competition, I talked about Modelo being a faster growing company, being squeezed out of industry, and new entrants coming in.\nWithin Strategy, I talked about duopoloy currently in place and possible expansion plans.\nWithin Operational, there is certainly more value in a large brand. Any synergies that could be sold. Any profit sharing or results sharing opportunities.\nInvestment options – When the money does come in, what to do with that money. Dividends, another acquisition, grow current businesses, improve current operations.\nDiversification premium: when you’re in 3 different business, you’re dinged in share price. The value of the firm is worth more separately. Transaction itself: the CEO needs to know what the right selling price is. Don’t get into numbers, but talk about it.\nTransaction price. How the transaction would change the industry’s beta and company’s beta.\nOnce you get out of the beer business, FEMSA is no longer in the same industry as a company. FEMSA was originally a consumer goods company. Once the beer business is sold, it’s more a distribution company. The profile of the company changes. There will be a change in shareholder. This will also change the company’s beta. As a CEO, you will need to understand these issues. Institutions that would previously fit in their beverage portfolio would no longer fit. FEMSA is facing the risk of getting squeezed out of industry because we’re growing slower than our competitor.\nGiven the trends, we will be squeezed out. If a third competitor comes into the equation, competition becomes harder to maintain and the company could be squeezed out further.\nBased on all these considerations the final recommendation to FEMSA is to sell the beer division.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: business competition; business turnaround.\nConsulting Firm: Bain & Company first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: telecommunications & network.\nCase Interview Question #00743: Our consulting firm is hired by the CEO of VoiceDirect. VoiceDirect is an American regional carrier which owns and operates the six largest wireless telecommunications network in the United States. Headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, they serve about 4 million customers in 26 U.S. states as of year 2014.\nThe client VoiceDirect has been packaging and reselling excess capacity on their cellular network to highly fragmented prepaid phone card buyers. Over the past few years, VoiceDirect has lost significant market share to their competitors. What is happening here, and how can you help VoiceDirect turn around the down trend?\nAdditional Information:\nWho are the client’s competitors? Only five other major players in this market (Verizon Wireless, Sprint, AT&T, T-Mobile, U.S. Cellular)\nWhat is their pricing? VoiceDirect charges five cents per minute, while all five other competitors charge three cents.\nPossible Answer:\nFirst, ask the candidate to calculate VoiceDirect’s percentage price premium\n(5 cents – 3 cents)/3 cents ~= 67%\nThe price premium is equal to 67%\nThe candidate should first draw a diagram to understand the market. The cellular market in the U.S. is divided into Contract (or pay after usage) and Prepaid minutes. We are not analyzing the “Contract”  market segment. The competitors’ strategy is to sell their excess capacity to the prepaid market. In light of current economy conditions and with the assumption that people who rely on prepaid cards are mostly those who have difficulty getting Contracts due to a bad credit history, this segment is growing.\nThe candidate then should ask what is the excess capacity for VoiceDirect (we can assume near infinite capacity) as well as demonstrate understanding that the marginal cost for providing this capacity is zero.\nAt this stage the candidate should try to evaluate the issues behind the loss of market share. After computing the client VoiceDirect’s price premium (67%), the candidate should establish three hypotheses.\n\nThere is no differentiation that justifies the price premium, technological (quality of the wireless signal), geographical (geographic availability), customer service, etc.\nThere is differentiation but it is not perceived by the market.\nThere is differentiation, the market perceives it but because of its place on the low end of the segment, people are not willing to pay for it.\n\nFor scenarios (1) and (3), a possible strategy would be to match the competitors’ prices, go from five cents/minute to three cents/minute. At this point, the candidate should argue that if the client VoiceDirect’s prices for “Contract” cellular service are larger than 3 cents/minute, there is the possibility of cannibalization of their customer base.\nFor scenario (2), the candidate should suggest possible marketing initiatives (a test to the candidate’s creativity). Possible examples are:\n\njoint campaigns with powerful brands offering prepaid phone cards (remember the marginal cost is zero);\noffering phone cards with a free cellphone, offering supplemental “Contract” phone cards;\ntwo-for-one campaigns;\noffering prepaid phone cards in exchange for competitors’ cards (but need to check if it is possible in light of regulatory restrictions)\n\nAt this point the interviewer should ask the candidate for other possible strategies (restart the top-down process)\nCan we enter into a contract at a set price to provide minutes to major prepay providers? The answer is no, Virgin Mobile already has an agreement with one of our competitors. The rest of the market is very fragmented.\nCan we vertically integrate and repackage the minutes ourselves, creating our own prepay brand? Or, is Virgin Mobile’s presence too strong to compete?\nDoes the price premium reflect down to the consumer level, or do the repackagers (gas stations, Wal-Marts, etc) eat the price delta? Would it make sense to renegotiate with repackagers to lower their margins?\nQuantitative Analysis\n\nPrice premium percentage (67%).\nThe marginal cost of providing extra minutes (it’s zero)\n\nKey Takeaways\nEven though five cents versus three cents seem small, the resulting 66% price premium becomes a major issue as purchase volumes go up. It costs VoiceDirect nothing to provide more minutes, as capacity is unlimited. Providing that there will be no cannibalization of their postpaid customer base, there is only upside in matching the competitors’ prices.\nRecommended Conclusion\nThe client should immediately cut their price to at least the competitor level for repackaging purposes. Assess whether it will be effective for VoiceDirect to go into prepay repackaging market. This is important since people with bad credit and people under age 18, for example, cannot enter into Contracts with VoiceDirect.\nAt this point, if there is still time, ask the candidate to estimate the impact of his or her recommendation, in percentage changes in demand. Tell the candidate that elasticity for these type of products is approximately -1.25. The candidate should explain what Elasticity is and why it is negative. Elasticity ε= (ΔDemand/Demand) / (ΔPrice/Price) \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new product, new technology.\nConsulting Firm: Boston Consulting Group (BCG)  first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: Automotive, Motor Vehicles; Energy Industry.\nCase Interview Questions #00742:  Your client PIAA Corporation is a large diversified manufacturing company with a number of products. They are a large player in the automotive industry but also have products within the consumer products industry. The company’s products include professional racing lamps, automotive halogen lamps and bulbs, automotive H.I.D. lamps and bulbs, automotive light-emitting diode (LED) lamps and bulbs, automotive aluminum road wheels, automotive wiper blades and street lamps, LED daytime lamps, horns, oil filters, and radiator caps.\nAcquisitions are commonplace in this industry and your client PIAA Corporation recently acquired another company in the consumer products space. After the acquisition, the PIAA management team found that the acquired company has some  intellectual property that could lead to the production of low mercury compact fluorescent light (CFL) bulbs. CFLs, like all fluorescent lamps, contain mercury as vapor inside the glass tubing. While mercury helps achieve high performance, it also has hazardous properties. Most CFLs contain 3–5 mg per bulb. The acquired company’s intellectual property could produce a new generation of “eco-friendly” CFLs that contain as little as 1 mg per bulb.\nSo your client PIAA wants to know what they should do with the intellectual property. What would you tell the client?\nAdditional Information:\nProducts: The client company PIAA doesn’t have CFL lighting products within their mix. They do manufacture similar devices within their automotive sector such as bulbs in the cars so they have the capability to manufacture this new product.\nCustomer: The client works with large retailers and wholesalers.\nTechnology: We believe the new technology will work and will have great performance. There are 10 other patents with this technology. The client is 5 years ahead of competition.\nPricing: Average current price is $5 per bulb but this new technology will increase light bulb price by 60% (calculate $8/per bulb)\nPossible Answer:\n1. Areas of Discussion\nEvaluate the company and understand their product mix, customers and distribution. Then look at the external environment to understand the competitive landscape size of the market, the various products in the market and any barriers to entry. Once the company’s capacity to manufacture the light bulbs and the competitive landscape are determined then determine if the intellectual property is more valuable for the company to sell or to keep and manufacture the product.\nThe candidate should also state upfront that the client has four options:\n\ndevelop and market the new light bulb itself (i.e. acting on the intellectual property)\nsell the intellectual property to another company\nenter a joint venture with another company to develop and market the bulb\nhold onto the intellectual property and preserve the option to act on it\n\n2. Analysis\nTo determine the best of these options the candidate will evaluate each. For the sake of simplicity, the first two should be evaluated in depth first.\nOption 1: develop and market the new light bulb itself.\nThis could be assessed on an NPV (net present value) basis over a number of years to capture the replacement cycle and market growth.\nAdditional Information needed:\nRevenues:\n\nTotal market size of commercial (B to B) and retail (B to C) light bulb market\nCompact fluorescent light bulbs’ current share of this market and likely growth rate\nEvaluation of the client’s market share capture with the new low mercury technology\nLikelihood of competitor entry and potential impact on the client’s market share\nThis is all to get to the total revenue per year (price x volume), which you would expect to change from years 0 to 6\n\nExample of Market Sizing:\nAssuming the product will be sold first to households (B to C), then with success move to businesses (B to B).\n\nSuppose 100 Million household in the U.S.\n20M – 1 bedroom – 8 light bulbs – 160M light bulbs\n40M – 2 bedrooms – 10 light bulbs – 400M light bulbs\n40M – 3 bedrooms – 12 light bulbs – 480M light bulbs\nTotal 1040M light bulbs in market\n\nThis is a broad assumption since the business market (B to B) would be far larger and be a market to target first. Distribution is likely far more consolidated as well. The candidate would ideally go beyond consumer facts and have some sense of business data.\nCosts:\nIncremental fixed costs to current business: The candidate should go through the value chain of “Development -> Manufacturing -> Packing -> Marketing -> Distribution” to evaluate any fixed costs that would be added due to this business.\nCosts of goods sold (variable costs): Include all costs from manufacturing, packing, marketing, distribution to determine the total cost per bulb x Volume projected during the “Revenues” discussion above.\nThe candidate should then calculate the total operating profit per year (possibly factor in corporate tax to be accurate) and calculate the NPV.\nOption 2: sell the intellectual property to another company\nThe same data used above would be the value of selling the new technology. The candidate would need to explore whether the value to another company would be greater due to any impacts on revenue (e.g., higher volume due to one fewer competitors entering the market) or costs (potentially a buyer has better capabilities for the product and therefore the incremental fixed costs or variable costs of goods sold are lower.\nOption 3: enter a joint venture with another company to develop and market the bulb\nThis could be tested verbally rather than quantified for the sake of time. The candidate could ask about the potential of reducing their own costs by outsourcing or partnering with another entity.\nOption 4: hold onto the intellectual property and preserve the option to act on it\nThis is likely not a good option unless the market growth may spike so significantly in year 2 that it would offset a new entrant in year 5. This would just be a good point of discussion.\nPart #2: Interviewer: Based on the market sizing discussed above, consider what is the average life span of the new light bulb.\nPossible Answer:\nA total of five years\nSo there are approximately 208 M light bulbs sold per year (total market 1040 M / 5 years),\nso the maximum revenue per year is 208M * $8 = $1,664M\nAssuming that they don’t capture the entire market.\nLife of light bulb (at what point will the market be saturated and due to the longer life of the product. At that point they can enter into businesses and then maybe international.\nLook also at pricing later because if the product life span is 5 years versus current 6 months-1 year, then there is possibly an opportunity for higher prices or to decrease the life span of the bulb so not to jeopardize future sales.\nPart #3 Recommended Conclusion: Interviewer: now, please summarize your findings.\nPossible Answer:\nRecommend the manufacture of the light bulb because it increases revenue by ~$17M for each percent of the market they capture. They are also ahead of the competition so will be first to market and can become the standard. They need to create marketing and education plans to accomplish commercialization of the product since it is priced higher than current bulbs.\nAdditional things to consider:\n\nIf there is excess capacity to manufacture, there will be additional costs.\nCreate a prototype to see if bulb meets expectations.\nFinancial capabilities to develop since the company has a strong R&D group.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: operations strategy, marketing.\nConsulting Firm: ZS Associates first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: food and beverage.\nCase Interview Question #00744: PepsiCo Inc. (NYSE: PEP) is an American multinational food and beverage corporation headquartered in Purchase, New York, United States, with interests in the manufacturing, marketing and distribution of grain-based snack foods, beverages, and other products. PepsiCo was formed in 1965 with the merger of the Pepsi-Cola Company and Frito-Lay, Inc. PepsiCo has since expanded from its namesake product Pepsi to a broader range of food and beverage brands.\nPepsiCo has come to your consulting firm for advice on whether they should run a nationwide bottle-top promotion for a major sporting event in year 2012, e.g. the Super Bowl. What factors should PepsiCo consider in order to make this decision, and what recommendation should be given to PepsiCo?\nPossible Answer:\nPart 1: Qualitative Analysis\n1. Previous campaigns and scope of the proposed campaign \na. Discuss any previous campaigns and any learning points\ni. Previous campaigns have generally been successful, but PepsiCo has found that they make most profit from high profile campaigns.\nii. Previous campaigns have involved prizes ranging from soccer balls or basketballs (depending on the campaign) to all expenses paid trip to a sporting event.\nb. Lead time involved in changing the design of labels on bottles and bottle tops is minimal and is zero cost.\nc. Proposed campaign:\niii. Discuss the type of sporting event. 2012 is a big year with the Olympics and annual sporting events such as the Super Bowl, NBA playoffs, etc.\niv. Collect bottle tops and claim varying level of prizes vs. lucky bottle tops for grand prize vs. another idea or combination of all.\nv. Begin promotion three months before the sporting event.\n2. Competitor campaigns\nd. Competitors, e.g., Coca Cola, are expected to run similar campaigns. Discuss historical drink preference of customer (Coke vs. Pepsi), and likelihood of switching between the two drinks. Also discuss keeping those incremental PepsiCo drinkers after the marketing campaign.\ne. Review the impact of other campaigns, such as McDonalds or Burger King, deemed minimal given the different product offerings, i.e. bottle of soda to quench thirst or give energy vs. extra value meal where the drink comes with.\n3. Financials of running a campaign – incremental cash flow\nf. Monthly Revenue – see calculations below\ng. Costs – see calculations below.\nh. Time horizon\ni. Net cash flow\n4. Consider the selection of sporting event and interest level of each event, Super Bowl vs. Olympics vs. NBA Playoffs and the difference in incremental revenue. Do this qualitatively and discuss where one would get data from if running out of time.\nPart 2: Quantitative Analysis\nThe quantitative analysis of this marketing strategy case should not focus on the total beverage market, but instead focus on the incremental PepsiCo sales that would be gained by the promotion over both the short-term and long-term (by customers switching from Coke to Pepsi).\n1. Monthly revenue\na. Price: Soda bottle – $1.50, and soda can – $1. Average out to $1.25\nb. Quantity: Only target those who are currently indifferent between Coke and Pepsi, seeing as loyal Coke drinkers will not switch. Also consider Pepsi drinkers may switch from drinking another product to Pepsi more often – but not necessary in calculations (for time). Steps required:\nSize total soda market in USA\n\nUS Population: 300 million\nSegment by age with life expectancy at 80 years, and assume population uniformly distributed among ages. Therefore 3.75 million in each age band (300m / 80 years)\nMake assumptions for number of soda drinkers in each category and build table similar to below.\n\n\n\n\nAge group\n# in each category\n% soda drinkers in category\nFrequency of soda drinking\nSodas per month\n\n\n0 – 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 – 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 – 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20 – 40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n40 – 60\n\n\n\n\n\n\n60 – 80\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc. Make assumption for number of consumers that are indifferent between Coke and Pepsi to arrive at potential sales per month.\n2. Monthly costs – take marketing costs as a percentage of revenues for simplification, i.e. 10%.\n3. Cost of prizes – estimate costs of flights, hotels, tickets, spending money for 10 people. Can also estimate cost of smaller prizes too but likely to be immaterial.\nPart 3: Recommended Conclusion\nConclusion should be based on the net cash flow calculated above balances against any qualitative arguments made earlier.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new business.\nConsulting Firm: KPMG Advisory first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: life & health insurance.\nCase Interview Question #00745: Your client Aetna, Inc. (NYSE: AET) is a healthcare insurance company that serves the Medicare population. As one of the largest managed health care companies in the U.S., Aetna sells traditional and consumer directed health care insurance plans and related services, such as medical, pharmaceutical, dental, behavioral health, long-term care, and disability plans.\nOver the past two years, your client Aetna and some other healthcare insurance companies have started offering “private fee-for-service” (PFFS) to their respective Medicare patients. The benefit to the patient is that with PFFS, the patient has access to “out-of-network” providers that otherwise would not be covered by their health insurance plan. With the PFFS program, the patient interacts with their healthcare insurance company directly, while Medicare compensates the insurance company for the fees involved.\nAs I mentioned, your client Aetna launched their PFFS program two years ago. They expect the product to gain in popularity among their members. Other healthcare insurance companies also expect PFFS to grow. However, many insurance companies who have started offering PFFS are concerned because they do not currently have the additional administrative support needed in their billing departments to process all the PFFS claims.\nYour client Aetna is therefore interested in launching a “B to B” model to offer billing services to other healthcare insurance companies that are looking to outsource the work involved in processing PFFS claims. Is it a good idea for your client to offer this new service? Why or why not?\nAdditional Information:\n\nYour client Aetna is a large, nationwide plan.\nYour client Aetna is already offering the service for their own members, so startup costs are minimal.\nAssume the administrative staff/infrastructure needed is already in place.\n\nPossible Answer:\nI. Areas of Discussion\nPotential areas of interest:\n\nCompany\nCustomer\nSize of market\n\n1. What types of healthcare insurance companies are offering PFFS? Who are the customers for this service?\nAlthough both small and large healthcare insurance companies are offering PFFS, only small plans would need to outsource the back office services needed to process PFFS claims (since large plans already have the necessary administrative support in place to process claims).\n2. How big is the market for this new service? What is the growth rate? What percentage of Medicare members are enrolled under PFFS?\nSee analysis below\nDo not focus on financials/profit; if asked, let the candidate know that the client Aetna is looking to get at least 100 customers (small healthcare insurance companies) by the year 2016. The client is confident that, by the year 2016, they can capture at least 80% of the market for this service.\nII. Quantitative Analysis\n3. Provide the information from the first two rows; the interviewee should calculate the numbers from the third row:\n\n\n\nYear\n2008\n2012\n2016\n\n\nTotal number of Medicare members from the small health plans that want to outsource their back office services\n9.1 million\n11.3 million\n15.3 million\n\n\nPercentage of Medicare members that will use PFFS\n22%\n29%\n32%\n\n\nNumber of Medicare members that will use PFFS from the plans that want to outsource their back office services (To be calculated by Candidate)\nApprox. 2 million (actual: 2,002,000)\nApprox. 3.3 million (actual: 3,277,000)\nApprox. 5 million (actual: 4,896,000)\n\n\n\n4. After the Candidate calculates the numbers above, provide the following information:\nIn year 2016, the average number of Medicare members in the small health plans that are interested in the service your client is offering is 40,000 members. How many potential customers will there be in 2016?\nPossible Answer:\nGiven that approximately 5 million members in total will be using PFFS in 2016 (calculated above), 5 million/40,000 = 125 health plans using PFFS that are interested in outsourcing their back office work.\n5. At this point, let the Candidate know (if you haven’t already) that the client Aetna is confident that they can capture 80% market share by 2016. How many customers would that be?\nPossible Answer:\nSo, 80% of 125 clients is 80% * 125 = 100.\nIII. Recommended Conclusion\nOnly small plans that offer PFFS will look to outsource the back office services, not large plans.\nIn 2016, there will be approximately 125 small plans interested in outsourcing their back office services for PFFS billing.\nWith 80% of the market share, the client Aetna would be able to meet its goal of 100 customers by 2016, so yes, they should offer the service.\nRisk to be considered include:\n\nConsidering that the client Aetna launched their PFFS program only two years ago, would it be possible for us to scale our billing department to service 80 customers.\nAs customer service is important especially for Medicare members (age > 65 years), would we maintain quality of service required with the rapid growth to 80 customers in two years (from 2014 to 2016)?\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: increase sales; market entry; merger and acquisition (M&A).\nConsulting Firm: Boston Consulting Group (BCG) first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: household goods & consumer products.\nCase Interview Question #00746: You are the Vice President of market development for the Gillette Company, an American consumer packaged goods (CPG) company headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. The Gillette Company was founded by King C. Gillette in 1901 as a safety razor manufacturer. Nowadays the Gillette Company sells four major product lines generating $500 Million in annual revenues:\n(1) shaving products\n(2) skin care (with skin protective and sun-blocking properties)\n(3) baby care bottles (impact resistant)\n(4) tampons (very absorbent features)\nThe year is 2006. Your company Gillette has just been acquired by Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG), a global consumer goods company that makes a wide range of products including pet foods, cleaning agents, personal care products, and shaving products. Most of Procter & Gamble’s brands are global products available on several continents.\nHow would you recommend increasing the Gillette Company’s sales from $500 Million to $1 Billion in 2 years post acquisition?\nPossible Answer:\nPost acquisition there are potential synergies in distribution between Procter & Gamble and Gillette related to shaving and skin care products. Gillette should look to grow geographically to new markets. One criterion is to focus on areas that are greatly exposed to the sun.\nAnother focus is to look at the ability of Gillette to finance the expansion so it may want to divest another product line if it is not performing as well as sun care such as either the tampon or baby care lines.\nThe following additional information is provided about the various international markets:\n\n\n\nRegion\nMarket Size (billions)\nGrowth Trend\n\n\nU.S.\n$50 Billion\n3%\n\n\nEurope\n$30 Billion\n6%\n\n\nAsia\n$10 Billion\n12%\n\n\nLatin America\n$10 Billion\n12%\n\n\n\nThe candidate may want to ask more about the perception of Gillette’s sun care brand in each market to determine possible performance.\n\n\n\nRegion\nBrand Ranking\nValue Proposition\n\n\nU.S.\n#2 or #3\nFunctional Care\n\n\nEurope\n#2\nAspirational U.S. lifestyle\n\n\nAsia\n#1\nBeauty and fairness\n\n\nLatin America\n#1 or #2\nFunctional Care\n\n\n\nInterviewer: Based on this information, which two geographical markets would you want to focus on first and second? Why? The candidate then is asked what are the ways he/she will expand in each market.\nPossible Answer:\nPhase 1: Enter the Asian market can be first for its high growth and market potential. The Gillette Company can take advantage of its core functionality for sun protection and sun blocking since the Asian market values maintaining fair skin to avoid suntans. Market entry includes establishing suppliers, retail distribution, addressing the competitive reaction, marketing, any language or cultural issues and local government regulations.\nPhase 2: Enter the Latin American market based on the products’ skin care functionality.\nPhase 3: Sell product to the distributors and acquire a supply chain.\nInterviewer: If the retail price per case is $150, and the mark up margin by the distributor to the retailer is 50%, and the markup from your company Gillette (manufacturer) is 100%, what is the cost of each case?\nPossible Answer:\nTake $150 / (1 + 50%) = $100 price to distributor.\nTake $100 / (1 + 100%) = $50 cost from manufacturer\nInterviewer: What are some savings and costs associated with the use of a distributor?\nPossible Answer:\nSignificant cost savings can be accomplished by\n\nRecognizing synergies from having Gillette use the same supplier and distribution networks already in place by Procter & Gamble.\nCost savings from further economies of scale.\n\nHowever, the main costs of discontinuing with Gillette’s current supplier are:\n\nContract costs of terminating the relationship short of the agreed upon expiration.\nSunk costs of the inventory that the current supplier will no longer be motivated to support as the relationship has ended.\nFees to the new supplier.\n\nRecommended Conclusion\nGillette should look to leverage the synergies from Procter & Gamble such as similar product lines in skin care and access to the global market using Procter & Gamble’s international suppliers and networks.\nThe expansion into the global markets should be evaluated along the preferences of each geographical region based on market growth potential first in Asia and then Latin America. Each region would require different marketing strategies that match each area’s preferences from functional to lifestyle aspirations benefit propositions.\nThe expansion has opportunities for significant cost savings from synergies in sharing suppliers and distributors that would need to be above the costs of terminating Gillette’s existing relationships.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: HR, organizational behavior.\nConsulting Firm: Ernst & Young (EY) first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: retail; consumer electronics.\nCase Interview Question #00747: Your client Best Buy Co., Inc. (NYSE: BBY) is an American consumer electronics retail chain selling products such as TVs, DVD players, MP3 players, digital cameras, video camcorders, and cell phones. Headquartered in Richfield, Minnesota, United States, the company operates  more than 1,150 chain stores domestically and internationally.\nHistorically, your client Best Buy has relied on rapid opening of new stores in new geographical locations to increase revenue growth above GDP growth rate. However, sales have varied dramatically across Best Buy’s stores with several stores experiencing a severe decline in revenues over the past two years.\nThe senior management of Best Buy has just retained your consulting firm  to review the problem. How can you help the client even out performance across the individual stores and increase the performance of the entire retail chain through organizational change?\nPossible Answer:\nThe interviewer (case giver) should be aware that the problem of this case lies in the client Best Buy’s sales decline but occurring only in a limited number of stores. The interviewer starts by asking the candidate to design an issue tree or a hypothesis tree (whichever one the candidate feels more comfortable with).\nThe first level of the issue tree should separate externalities (aggressive competition, decrease in market demand, etc) from internal issues. The candidate should then be told to focus on internal issues. Some of the problems the candidate should come up with are: weak marketing strategy, poor choice of product mix shown in Best Buy stores, low knowledge base of employees (sales force), ineffective incentives program for the sales force, poor after-sale customer service, etc.\nTo guide the candidate to walk through the problem and come up with a solution, the below numerical data shall be provided and carefully analyzed. These numbers belong to one of the stores facing a decrease in sales.\nBased on this information the candidate should be asked how he or she would calculate the sales CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) over the past 2 years. If the candidate does not know the formula, the interviewer can provide it as necessary. The answer is as follows:\nCAGR = sqrt(2013 Sales / 2011 Sales) – 1\nThe interviewer can then provide the following data to the candidate for analysis:\n\n\n\nProduct\nSales\nGross Profit\nMargin\nSales 2011\nSales 2012\nSales 2013\nSales CAGR\n\n\nAccessories\n$2.50M\n$1.25M\n50%\n$2.50M\n$1.90M\n$1.40M\n-25%\n\n\nPlasma TV\n$7.00M\n$1.40M\n20%\n$7.00M\n$7.40M\n$7.70M\n5%\n\n\nDVD player\n$5.00M\n$0.75M\n15%\n$5.00M\n$5.30M\n$5.50M\n5%\n\n\nDigital Cameras\n$7.00M\n$2.10M\n30%\n$7.00M\n$6.30M\n$5.70M\n-10%\n\n\nVideo camcorders\n$2.50M\n$1.00M\n40%\n$2.50M\n$2.00M\n$1.60M\n-20%\n\n\n\nThe candidate should reach the following conclusion when analyzing the data.\nThe product lines with the negative CAGRs are those with the highest margin and they are also some of the most technologically complex products (digital cameras, camcorders, accessories). These products would require a higher level of customer service to help customers become better informed in order to make proper buying decisions.\nCustomer service is lacking at many stores because of a lack of consistent training. Currently, training of sales employees is decentralized through an apprenticeship model, and at stores which perform poorly, the lack of adequate training is perpetuating poor store performance.\nThe largest revenue streams come from complex electronics such as Plasma TVs and digital cameras where product knowledge must be high among sales associates.\nRecommended Conclusion\nHaving identified the problem, the candidate should mention a set of possible solutions and make a recommendation based on a high level assessment of those possibilities.\nOne solution is to centralize the training program. Store managers can attend training seminars at the corporate headquarters and then disseminate their knowledge back to their staff. Such an arrangement would reduce the cost of training and streamline the knowledge transfer process.\nCorporate headquarters can also distribute training materials to ensure that sales associates are trained consistently across all stores. Product manufacturers can also create brochures or in store collateral to help promote information about their products. The store may want to share such costs through trade spend negotiations with the manufacturers.\nAdditionally, the sales incentive structure may need to be adjusted to ensure sales associates follow the training program closely. The client Best Buy may think about using quantitative metrics, such as Sales per Average Hour (SPAH) to measure the productivity of sales associates.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

This means public schools outsource this function to them. This client operates at a national level, and is the market leader at 50% market share of the outsourced school bus fleet operation. Exhibit 1 shows the market positioning in further detail.\nAs you can see from Exhibit 2, our client Blue Bird Corporation operates in an industry with razor-thin margins (5% – 10%), and is now experiencing stagnant revenues and profits.

In the background, realize that customer (the school system) is also a price-sensitive entity.\n2. On the cost side, economies of scale and scope are already met, financial structure is optimal, and operational best practices have been implemented successfully.\n3. The interviewer should explain Exhibit 2 line items to the candidate.\n\nCapital Investment refers to buses, etc.\nMaintenance Services refers to fleet maintenance and repair\nInformation Technology refers to fleet and driver scheduling, payroll, etc. Tell the candidate that small operators will often use inefficient, expensive, in-house IT development.\nPersonnel Training means training of drivers on security, safe driving, and other regulations. Quality of drivers needs to meet a certain high threshold, or schools will switch to another operator – making this quite important. Tell the candidate that fragmented operators will often under invest, as their margins are already tighter. As a result, they will often lose business to other fragmented operators.\nWages, etc. are fairly similar across this unionized industry.\n\nPossible Answer:\n1. Areas of Discussion\nFirst, consider the client’s core capabilities and competencies.\nThen, draw out the client’s entire value chain (procurement, training, servicing, operation, relationships with institutions)\nExhaust argument that dramatic improvement not possible in current business model, either on revenue or cost side.\nEventually, lead in the direction that selective competencies should be developed into business models and higher-growth, better margin, revenue streams (such as driver training, procurement, auto service, etc. – served to the fragmented portion of the market, which would then benefit from its economies of scale and learning).\nWhat are the relevant portions of the value chain to focus on (see Exhibit 3).\nExhibit 3: Relevant portions of the Value Chain for this discussion\nPersonnel Hiring >> Fleet Procurement >> Personnel Training >> Information Technology >> Operational Know-how >> Fleet Maintenance >> Sales, Marketing\nTarget the fragmented portion of the supplier base (~10%), and offer them B2B and consulting services in maintenance, training, procurement, etc.\n2. Analysis and Recommendation\nA. What are the possible new revenue streams?\n\nLeverage existing business model for additional revenue (dual use of bus fleet for non-school customers?)\nExtend use of same assets into other business models and revenue streams (consulting, outsourced services?)\n\nB. What is the biggest opportunity here?\n\nFragmented operators under invest in personnel training; our client could offer outsourced services to train personnel in fragmented operators band (Ideal, optimized market size for this service = the amount an optimized, mature player spends = 20%)\nFragmented operators over invest in IT; our client could offer packaged applications to shave off these excess costs (Market size in this space = IT budget of optimized players = 10%)\nFleet maintenance is another area that can be outsourced (Market size = 20%)\n\nC. Then, what is the size of this consulting/outsourcing market?\n$10 Billion (total size of the industry) x 20% (market share of fragment) x 50% (market size of opportunities from training, IT, maintenance) = $1 Billion\nD. Adjustments\nAssume that our client will capture 10% of this opportunity in 2 years;\nAssume that consulting, outsourcing has average margin of 25%;\n\nCurrent profit dollars of client = $10 B x 50% market share x 10% margin = $500 M\nAdditional profit by the end of 2 years = $1 B x 10% market share x 25% margins = $25 M\n$25 M / $500 M = 5%\n\nThis meets the 5% profitability growth target over a two year period. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: business turnaround; operations strategy.\nConsulting Firm: Roland Berger Strategy Consultants first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: chemical industry.\nCase Interview Question #00730: Your client Ashley Chemical Inc. is an American Fortune 500 chemical company headquartered in Covington, Kentucky. Ashley is a major U.S. chemical manufacturer in the commodity chemicals business with single digit market share. It recently emerged from bankruptcy and has very limited capital available. The chemicals business is cyclical with pricing cycles of 7 years. The client is worried about how it will survive year 2015 when it hits the bottom of the pricing cycle. The question is how this company can become sustainable, if at all possible.\nThe CEO of Ashley Chemical has hired your consulting firm to develop a new business model, either through:\n(1) acquisition into a non-cyclical chemicals market, or\n(2) the manufacture of new products and services for customers, or\n(3) your own recommendations.\nWhat would you recommend?\nAdditional Information: (Provide the following information if requested by interviewee)\n1. Competitors\nThe commodity chemical market is highly fragmented. A large number of competitors are either stand-alone or small in size, or are a small division of a larger conglomerate. Acquisition is difficult because of limited capital.\n2. Customers\nAshley’s customers are highly fragmented, each of them purchasing no more than 10% of the client’s inventory annually.\n3. Raw Materials\nYour client’s raw material suppliers are increasingly turning to “greener” processes and products without increasing their total capacity. This trend is significantly reducing the supply of “non-green” raw materials which drives their cost up.\n4. Infrastructure\nYour client currently has 5 plants. 3 are performing well, one has been having problems of quality consistency recently and one plant has been historically a bad performer in terms of capacity utilization. All plants are over 10 years old and production is spread evenly over all the plants. (none are at full capacity)\n5. Government\nIncreasing push from environmental groups has caused additional government taxes and regulations on shipping to be enacted recently.\n6. Products\nThe chemical manufacturer Ashley mainly produces two chemicals: X and Y. Chemical Y is a by-product of Chemical X with a weight ratio of X = 1.5Y (each 1.5 ton of X manufactured results in the byproduction of 1 ton of Y).\n\n\n\n\n2012 Prices per ton\n2013 Prices per ton\n2012 Costs per ton\n2013 Costs per ton\n\n\nChemical X\n$150\n$100\n$50\n$95\n\n\nChemical Y\n$175\n$100\n\n\n\n\n\nThe client Ashley expects to sell 100% of the chemicals manufactured. All of its plants operate below capacity; they currently manufacture 100,000 tons of Chemical X annually to meet the market demand. The pricing changes are normal.\nPossible Answer:\nProfit margin should be calculated, in addition to the dollar margin derived from Chemical X versus Chemical Y to determine if there is any advantage to changing the product mix.\nIn 2013, 100,000 tons of X are being manufactured at a profit of $5/ton, deriving a profit of $500,000 for Chemical X. The manufacturing of X results in the by-production of 100,000 / 1.5, i.e. around 66,667 tons of Chemical Y or 70,000 tons for rounding purposes. Since Chemical Y is a byproduct of X, one can assume a corresponding cost of $0/ton. The client should thereby derive a profit of $100 x 70,000 = $7,000,000 for Chemical Y, and a total profit of around $7,500,000 for both chemicals.\nComparatively, the company generated a profit of $100 x 100,000 = $10,000,000 for Chemical X in 2005, plus an additional $175 x 70,000 = $12,250,000 for Chemical Y. This amounts to a total profit of 22,250,000 in 2012, and therefore a huge loss in profit. These results are summarized in the following Tables:\n\n\n\nYear 2006\nVolume (ton)\nPrince/ton\nCost/ton\nProfit margin %\nProfit margin\n\n\nChemical X\n100,000\n$100\n$95\n5%\n$500,000\n\n\nChemical Y\n66.667\n$100\n-\n100%\n$6,666,667\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n$7,166,667\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear 2005\nVolume (ton)\nPrince/ton\nCost/ton\nProfit margin %\nProfit margin\n\n\nChemical X\n100,000\n$150\n$50\n67%\n$10,000,000\n\n\nChemical Y\n66.667\n$175\n-\n100%\n$11,666,667\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n$21,666,667\n\n\n\nRecommended Conclusion\nThis case is qualitative in nature and can take many directions.\nThe interviewee should first explore the root causes of the sales and profit cycles including the following topics:\n\nWhy are costs increasing?\nWhy is there a reduction in supply of raw materials and can it be addressed?\nWho are our client Ashley’s customers?\nCan the client company pass them raw material cost increases?\nWhat are the new government regulations’ impact?\nHow efficient is manufacturing?\n\nThe interviewee should further review pros & cons of acquisition, joint venture, licensing, divesting a plant or two, and organic growth through new products/services (preferably with a pricing cycle opposite that of X and Y). The dimensions for evaluating each option should include impact on sales/profit, ROI, risk, feasibility, and timing.\nIn addition to organic and inorganic growth, there seems to be opportunities to improve the current business model. For example, since none of the plants operates at capacity and Chemical Y can be sold at a higher price/margin than Chemical X in the upside part of the pricing cycle, the interviewee may ask these questions:\n\nCan the plants increase their production of X and Y when the pricing cycle is up?\nAre there opportunities for cost reduction by increasing the volume of raw materials purchased?\nCan the more profitable chemical Y be produced in larger quantities in upside cycles?\n\nExploring the trend of raw materials suppliers turning to greener products:\n\nIf the suppliers of raw materials for X and Y are switching to “greener” processes across the industry, can the client pass on the price increase along the value chain?\nCan the client use this as an opportunity to differentiate its products as “green” as well and therefore charge a premium?\n\nPossible recommendation may include:\n\nLaunch new products & services to differentiate from the competition, build customer loyalty, gain new customers, and leverage synergies through existing plants.\nOperating costs may increase with purchase of new materials/machinery for refining chemicals.\nOrganic growth must be considered in addition to improving the client’s current business model which does not seem to be working well.\nPossible exploration into joint ventures or divesting the company.\n\nAny number of recommendations would work for this case as long as the interviewee properly explores all of the options.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: business competition; business turnaround.\nConsulting Firm: OC&C Strategy Consultants first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: restaurant & food service.\nCase Interview Question #00748: Your client is the owner of an Applebee’s franchise restaurant in the small town of Shelton, Connecticut (population ~40,000 as of 2010 census). The Applebee’s concept focuses on casual dining, with mainstream American dishes such as sandwiches, burgers, salads, shrimp, chicken, and pasta.\nRecently, the Shelton Applebee’s restaurant’s revenues are trending downward but costs are stable. Therefore, profits are shrinking quickly. What are your thoughts on:\n(1) the cause of the issue,\n(2) how to help turn around the business.\nAdditional Information:\nThere are no changes in customer tastes. The client’s menu, food quality, service and suppliers are all the same.\nThe main cause in the sales drop is the opening of a new competitor FinerFoods Restaurant that just opened across the street. FinerFoods Restaurant is a fast food “plus” style restaurant that serves not only traditional fast food (sandwiches, burgers), but also a broader menu (chicken, pasta, burritos) with table clothes and waiter service. FinerFoods Restaurant has a family-friendly atmosphere.\n(Do not give the below information unless candidate asks about the Applebee restaurant’s customer segments) There are two main customer segments served by Shelton Applebee’s:\n\nBusiness customers for lunch (60% of your clientele)\nFamilies for dinner (40% of your clientele)\n\nShelton Applebee’s is losing both its business lunch and family dinner segment to the new competition.\nPossible Answer:\nInterviewer: Which customer segment is more important and more profitable between the business and family segments?\nBy reviewing the profitability of Shelton Applebee’s by customer:\n\nBusiness Lunch garners an average profit of $8 per customer\nThe overall average profit is $10 per customer\n\nInterviewer: What is the average profit for the Family Dinner segment?\nPossible Answer:\nThe candidate should ask for the following information to back solve for a weighted average:\n\nLunch is 60% of the customer segment\nDinner is 40% of the customer segment\n\nOnce the candidate asks for the number of customers, she/he can use a weighted average formula to find the profitability per customer for the dinner segment.\n0.60 * $8 + 0.40 * $X = $10 overall average profit per customer\nX = profitability for the Dinner segment is $13 per customer, which is more profitable than the lunch segment for Shelton Applebee. It would likely recoup the loss of this customer segment from FinerFoods.\nInterviewer: If the total average profit margin is 50%, what is the overall average revenue per customer?\nPossible Answer:\n$10 / 0.50 = $20 revenue per customer (customers really like Applebee’s)\nInterviewer: FinerFoods Restaurant’s revenues are 20% higher and costs are 10% higher than that of Shelton Applebee’s overall average customer. What is the average profit per customer at FinerFoods Restaurant?\nPossible Answer:\nRevenues: (1 + 20%) * $20 = $24\nCosts: (1 + 10%) * $10 = $11 (Note: The costs for Shelton Applebee is determined by revenue less)\nShelton Applebee’s Gross margin from above: $20 – $10 = $10\nFinerFoods Restaurant’s Profit = $24 – $11 = $13\nInsight: FinerFoods has a more profitable business at $13 vs. Shelton Applebee’s $10 per average customer.\nInterviewer: How would Shelton Applebee’s determine why their customers are leaving?\nPossible Answers:\n\nCreate customer satisfaction survey – be sure to account for biases by interviewing an equal number of regular vs. one-time customers.\nAsk corporate headquarters to provide information on performance of other Applebee’s restaurants due to effects of a nearby FinerFoods (or similar competitor) opening to determine if customer defections are widespread.\nIndustry publications.\n\nInterviewer: You now have a chance to create some customer survey questions. You can ask any customer but state whom the survey is tailored toward and state your most important question. (Provide opportunity for the candidate to state various survey audiences and question possibilities).\nWait until after candidate finishes the exercise then state the following:\nInterviewer: We have some additional survey data collected and here are the results:\nFirst survey audience consists of Shelton Applebee’s defecting family dinner customer:\nSurvey Question: What are important factors in your purchase decisions?\nSurvey Answer: Family dinner customers value price and service. They are price sensitive and like the perception of FinerFoods as providing value. FinerFoods also has waiter service so the parents do not need to clean up after their children’s meals, service is viewed as quick. The prices are comparable to Shelton Applebee’s, although 20% higher.\nSecond survey audience consists of Shelton Applebee’s defecting business lunch customer:\nSurvey Question: What are important factors in your purchase decisions?\nSurvey Answer: Business lunch customers value speed and convenience. They perceive Shelton Applebee’s as providing relatively slower service and less convenience than FinerFoods since FinerFoods has waiter service. While the time spent at with waiter service at FinerFoods and the time spent waiting in line at Shelton Applebee’s is about the same, the perception is that FinerFoods is faster service.\nInterviewer: Which customer segment would you focus on based on your survey information and recommend solutions to help your client Shelton Applebee’s restaurant. You cannot hire any additional service staff nor change their menu offerings (per corporate policy).\nPossible Answer:\nFocus on the more profitable family dinner customer (at the higher $13/profit per customer vs. $8 business lunch customer) and one possible solution includes:\nProviding entertainment for children at Shelton Applebee’s such as a playground, a clown, or offer promotions on birthday or other special celebrations to make Shelton Applebee’s a destination of choice for family events. Shelton Applebee’s can also reduce the amount of packaging so there is less to clean up for the family. The children may drive the decision of parents to frequent Shelton Applebee’s if they view the restaurant as more attractive and fun.\nRecommended Conclusion\nInterviewer: Please summarize your findings (cause of the sales deterioration, and recommended solutions to address the problem faced by your client Shelton Applebee’s franchise).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: private equity (PE), investment; market sizing.\nConsulting Firm: ZS Associates first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: sports, leisure & recreation.\nCase Interview Question #00729: Your client Advent International is an American private equity firm focused on buyouts of companies in Western and Central Europe, North America, Latin America and Asia. The firm focuses on international buyouts, growth and strategic restructuring in five core sectors. Originally founded in Boston, Massachusetts, Advent currently operates from offices in 16 countries, with affiliates in a further eight countries and employs over 170 investment professionals.\nWhen making a decision about whether or not to purchase a company, the client looks at projected profits of the target company 3-5 years out.\n\nIf profits are flat or up, buy\nIf profits are down, do not buy\n\nRecently, the client is considering purchasing a firm that makes bike helmets and bike accessories; you have been hired to determine whether or not they should purchase this firm. How would you approach this case?\nAdditional Information: (Provide the following information if requested by interviewee)\n\nThe target company only sells its products in the U.S.\nRevenue mix from the two product lines (bike helmets and bike accessories) is 50/50.\nThe target company currently has 70% market share in the U.S.\nThe target company has good relationships with suppliers.\nThe products are distributed mainly through specialty stores.\n\nIf the candidate asks “Is the overall bike helmet market growing?”, ask them “what do you think?”, and make them justify their answer. Ask them to provide you with a percentage growth or shrinking (range is OK)\nExample of an answer, but obviously there are many: “I believe the bike helmet market is growing because people are exercising more because of health concerns, gas prices are increasing rapidly so more people are using bikes as transportation (I had this case during the $4/gallon gas days), and Lance Armstrong has revived an interest in the sport.”\nAnother sample answer: “When I was growing up, hardly anyone wore bike helmets, but now with increased government regulation and safety concerns, almost all bikers wear helmets. Therefore, we can think about growth in the bike helmet industry in relation to growth in the interest in biking.\nPossible Answer:\n1. Areas of Discussion\nAt some appropriate point during the interview, the interviewer should ask the candidate to determine the annual revenue of the bike helmet company (market sizing). A good trick on this part is to realize that since the revenue mix is 50/50, they only have to size one of the two product lines (bike helmets and bike accessories), and then double their answer at the end. It is easier to size the bike helmets market, because accessories is a very broad category.\nThere is no single “right way” to size the bike helmets market, but here are some considerations:\n\nAge\nIncome\nUrban/rural areas\nBike helmet laws\nDelivery\n\n2. Analysis\nThe candidate should first size the entire U.S. market for bike helmets, and then take 70% of the total market since they have 70% market share.\nSample Answer, but estimates and factors for consideration will vary:\n\nThree biker segments: adult cycling enthusiast, casual biker, under 18 teen biker.\nAssume 100 million households in the U.S., 50% have children with average 2 children per household, 75% of children ride bicycles, therefore: 75M Under 18 customers.\nAssume 5% of adults are Cycling Enthusiasts, or 5M.\nAssume 20% of adults are Casual Bikers, or 20M.\nAssume a bike helmet will last for 5 years, so every year 1/5 of bikers’ helmets get replaced.\nTotal market size: (75M + 5M + 20M) * (1/5) = 20M\n\nThe candidate must be able to justify the numbers through each step of the process.\nQuestion #2: should the client Advent International purchase the bike helmet company or not?\nAdditional information:\n\nCompetition: 20% of players are at the low end.\nMost new entrants into the market have been at the high-end of the market.\nIf the candidate asks about new entrants, ask them what they think. Few barriers to entry.\n\nThe bike helmet company was originally in the high-end of the market, but is now in the mass market.\n\nDifferent product lines for high-end and mass market.\nMass merchandizing makes about 60% of the market and bike shops make up about 40%\n\nIf the candidate asks where the company distributes its product, put the question back on them: “Where do you think?”\n\nSpecialty stores, Sports Authority, Wal-Mart, Target\n\nThen ask “what are the risks of selling at Wal-Mart?”\n\nSqueezed on the prices\n\nWhat is more profitable, selling to the mass market or in specialty stores?\n\nSelling to the mass market is more profitable because specialty stores have higher distribution costs.\n\nRecommended Conclusion\nThis case is really designed to see how the interviewee thinks. The candidate needs to make assumptions and justify them throughout. The interviewer should push back on each assumption. In the end, the recommendation should be to not buy the company because the lower end of the bike helmet industry is most profitable, but has little product differentiation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Headquartered in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, the company sells its cookware and kitchen utensils to all 50 states in the U.S., along with All-Clad bonded ovenware, kitchen tools, and kitchen accessories. 70% of the goods are produced and imported from China and Italy, while 30% are manufactured locally in the U.S.\nThe client All-Clad has been in the industry for over 50 years and has a very strong brand name. Historically, All-Clad has enjoyed remarkable growth for a long time. Recently, however, the client has experienced a 1% decline in sales for each of the last 5 years and a comparable drop in earnings over the same period. The client would like to understand why the sales and earnings have dropped and how to address the issues. How would you go about this case?\nAdditional Information: (Provide the following information if requested by interviewee)\n1. Market\n\n95% of the client’s revenue is to restaurants with the remainder going to households.\nMarket growth: if the interviewee asks about market growth, push back and ask them what they think. This is a mature market, so market growth is low.\nThe client services the entire US, equal parts Northeast, Northwest, and South.\nNew competition has entered the market and copied their products.\n\n2. Company/Products\n\nThis is the client’s first experience with slumping sales.\nThey have best brand in the industry in terms of quality and recognition. They price their products at a slight premium. Locally manufactured goods have slightly higher margins.\nMix of products has changed slightly in the past few years. They sell their products to restaurant buying groups that represent a collection of restaurants. Competitors have begun offering complete kitchen solutions that include items the client does not currently produce.\n\n3. Costs\n\nCOGS: There has been a slight increase in the price to the client of the imported goods, about a 2% rise every 3 years.\nProduction costs: have not changed.\nDistribution costs: have increased slightly because of increased fuel costs from shipping the goods. The client contracts with shippers such as UPS or FedEx to deliver their products.\n\nPossible Answer:\nNormal profitability analysis (Profits = Revenues – Costs) should be performed at a high level in order to arrive to the following recommendations.\n1. Product lines\nTo address the competitive pressures, the client could form a joint venture with other manufacturers to offer complete solutions or add new products to their existing lineup to compete more effectively.\nThe interviewee should ask about profitability of the household business. There is no specific information, so ask the interviewee to brainstorm all of the things he/she would like to know about the consumer business.\n\nIs it a growing market?\nIs it more profitable than the restaurant business? Ask the interviewee what to do if it is and if it isn’t.\n\nIf yes – try to grow the household side of the business, and ask the interviewee to brainstorm ideas how.\nIf no – Divest or spin off this side of the business and focus on the core restaurant business.\n\n\n\n2. Revenues\nThe client has strongest brand name in the industry; the interviewee should explore increasing price premium to reinforce their brand image as the best in class.\nPromotions/Marketing – promote on chef reality shows, trade shows, higher-end restaurant chains, e.g. Morton’s The Steakhouse.\nExplore margins and internal capabilities of selling direct to restaurants to bypass the buying groups and capture more of the restaurants’ willingness to pay.\nSecond-hand market – since restaurant business is highly competitive with restaurants going out of business frequently, the client could start a “certified pre-owned” business line for their products, similar to car dealerships. If interviewee suggests this, ask them to brainstorm the benefits and risks. Obvious benefit: high margin. Obvious risk: cannibalization.\nBundle products together to increase sales of companion items.\n3. Costs\nLocally produced goods have higher margins. The interviewee should explore building or renting additional production facilities or expanding existing ones to reduce reliance on lower margin imports. They should mention current factory utilization rates.\nOr, try to squeeze foreign suppliers to reduce costs on imports.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The company operates more than 872 Toys “R” Us and Babies “R” Us stores in the United States, more than 715 international stores and over 180 licensed stores in 35 countries and jurisdictions. It also operates a portfolio of e-commerce sites including Toysrus.com, Babiesrus.com, eToys.com, and FAO.com.\nOn July 21, 2005, a consortium of Bain Capital Partners LLC, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) and Vornado Realty Trust invested $1.3 billion to complete a $6.6 billion leveraged buyout of the Toys “R” Us company. After the recent buyout by private equity, the client Toys “R” Us has been pursuing aggressive growth targets across all three of its divisions. The e-commerce division has about $400 million in total revenue and a major area of growth has been identified within Shipping & Handling (S&H) of customer orders.\nYour client offers its customer’s two Shipping & Handling options: “2nd Day Expedited” or “Ground”, and each of those are further divided into “Lower 48 States” or “Alaska & Hawaii” depending on the order destination zip code.

Divided as follows:\n\nS&H Revenue = 9% ($36 MM)\nMerchandize Sales Revenue = 91% ($364 MM)\n\nYour client ships customer orders from a single distribution center in Groveport, Ohio.\nYour client ships products in 8 different box sizes.\nTotal Annual S&H revenue from each product offering\n\nGround to Lower 48: $32 million\nGround to AK & HI: $180,000\nExpedited to Lower 48: $3.73 million\nExpedited to AK & HI: $90,000\n\nYour client is currently priced on par with competitors.\nPossible Answer:\nI. Areas of Discussion\nA. First, explore the revenue and pricing structure:\n1. Select SKU’s (items) in inventory have fixed S&H prices for each of the four delivery options regardless of delivery destination.\n2. 21% of all orders include SKU’s using these fixed prices.\n3. The majority of inventory is priced according to the weight of the order against a “weight table”. Weight table pricing is as such:\n\nGround shipments to the Lower 48 states begin at $4.84 for the first 1 lb and increases at $0.85 for each additional pound.\nGround shipments to AK & HI begin at $6.84 for the first 1 lb and increases at $0.85 for each additional pound.\n2nd Day shipments to the Lower 48 states begin at $10.98 for the first 1 lb and increases at $0.99 for each additional pound.\n2nd Day shipments to AK & HI begin at $20.98 for the first 1 lb and increases at $0.99 for each additional pound.\nThis weight table is a blended price that aggregates the zone-based cost table that the carrier charges and adds a 25% markup.\n\n4. 73% of all orders are priced against the weight table. Another 6% of orders include a mix of items with fixed price S&H and weight table pricing.\nB. Then, guide the interviewee to explore items with Fixed Pricing:\nFurther analysis into the SKU’s that have fixed shipping prices shows that 44 items represent 10% of merchandize revenue of all fixed price items and represent 59% of the losses in that segment.\nC. Explore the cost structure:\nYour client uses a single package delivery vendor to ship all orders. The vendor charges your client for each order based on the following factors:\n\nDistance. The lower 48 states are categorized into 8 zone distances, with 1 being the closest and 8 the furthest. Alaska & Hawaii are divided into 2 zones; Metro and Remote.\nSize. Small packages (less than 3 cubic feet) are billed based on its weight. Large items are billed based on volumetric dimensions.\n\nD. Have the interviewee brainstorm about other shipping cost drivers per order:\n\nNumber of Shipments. A large order with smaller items is likely to be more “combinable” and may ship in fewer boxes than one with larger items.\n“Over-boxed” items. Manufacture’s packaging of some items is not durable for cargo shipping and therefore needs to be put in another box, or “over-boxed”.\n\nE. Explore the following questions after graphs have been shared with the interviewee:\nQuestion #1. The largest loss bucket in S&H is Ground shipments to the Lower 48 states. Why should your client not increase its S&H prices for this group? Why should they increase prices on the other three S&H offerings?\nPossible Answer:\n\nGround shipping also constitutes the largest portion of your clients business and increasing prices could negatively affect demand for items and orders.\nExpedited shipping is a premium product and the customer is likely to be less elastic to an increase in price. Therefore an increase in price might not impact demand too much.\nAlaska and Hawaii constitutes a small fraction (less than 1%) of your client’s total business while contributing to ~5% of losses. Unless it is a business decision to maintain a presence in that region at such a cost, there is no reason to do so.\n\nQuestion #2. Your client’s shipping prices are on average 25% more than their vendor’s price table. Why do you think your client is seeing egregious losses in certain categories? How can they tackle this?\nPossible Answer:\nThe egregious loses are primarily due to “over-boxing” of items due to the limited number shipping boxes. The client would need to better understand the demand on various items, their dimensions, what items are most frequently combined and then determine the optimal assortment (number and dimensions) of shipment cartons they use. This would be a longer-term solution.\nQuestion #3. If you were to recommend a new pricing strategy that raises prices, how much would your business be at risk? How much of you estimated losses can you save?\nPossible Answer:\n\nThe percentage of business at risk is the ratio of the total merchandise dollars shipped through the segments that the candidate is recommending a price change to over the total business. If the interviewee recommends raising prices to Alaska & Hawaii, Expedited shipments and the 44 fixed price items the interview should identify approximately 11% of the business at risk (calculations below).\nPercentage of loss saved for the segments to AK & HI, Expedited shipments and the 44 fixed price items is approximately 30% (calculations below).\n\nQuestion #4. Should raising prices be a long-term solution? Why or why not?\nPossible Answer:\nRaising prices is not a long-term solution because it leaves your client at a competitive disadvantage. The long-term goals should be to reduce costs by further analyzing each of the cost drivers. Some longer-term solutions are:\n\nConducting a “carton-size study” to determine the optimal assortment of boxes used.\nLook to expand the distribution network to also ship items from distribution centers on the east and west coast.\nNegotiate lower shipping costs with the vendor.\n\nII. Analysis (Calculations to be completed by interviewee.)\nA. Margin on each product is calculated with the following formula:\n(Margin On Wins + Margin On Losses) / Total Revenue In Category\nMargin on Ground to Lower 48: 13%\nMargin on Ground to Alaska & Hawaii: -142%\nMargin on Expedited to Lower 48: -17%\nMargin on Expedited to Alaska & Hawaii: -39%\nB. Percentage of business at risk:\n(Merchandise To AK & HI + Merch To Expedited + 10% × Total Merch With Fixed Price) / Total Mechandize Dollars\n= (200 K + 30,000 K + 1,800 K + 10% × 76,440 K) / 364 MM\n= 10.89%\nC. Percentage of Loss Saved:\n(Loss Margin To AK & HI + Loss Margin To Expedited + 59% × Loss Margin With Fixed Price) / Total Mechandize Dollars\n= (257.2 K + 1,010 K + 38.18 K + 59% × 892.6 K ) / 6,172.2 K\n= 29.68%\nHandouts/Figures\nExhibit 1. Business Shipped to Various Segments.\n\nExhibit 2. Gross Margin on Category Wins and Losses.\n\nKey Takeaways (What the interviewee should glean from handouts/figures. There may be some calculations here as well.)\n1. Business Shipped to Various Segments.\n\nApproximately 1/3 (~28%) of the business is shipped to customers at a loss\nApproximately 2/3 (~78%) of all business to Alaska and Hawaii (Ground & 2nd Day) are shipped at a loss\nApproximately 1/3 (~34%) of all orders that have items with a fixed price are shipped to customers at a loss\n\n2. Gross Margin on Category Wins and Losses.\n\nOrders shipped by Ground to the Lower 48 states (which is ~91% of the business) accounts for ~79% of Losses\nOrders with only items with fixed S&H pricing (which is 21% of the business) accounts for ~14% of Losses\nOrders shipped Expedited to the Lower 48 states (which is ~8% of the business) accounts for ~16% of Losses\nOrders shipped by Ground to Alaska and Hawaii (which is ~0.5% of the business) accounts for ~4% of Losses\nOrders shipped Expedited to Alaska and Hawaii (which is ~0.05% of the business) accounts for ~0.6% of Losses\n\nIII. Recommended Conclusion\nIn the short-term the client can save ~30% of losses by:\n\nIncreasing fixed S&H prices on 44 SKU’s.\nRaise weight table prices for Ground orders to AK & HI and Expedited orders to both the Lower 48 states and AK & HI.\n\nThe higher prices might leave the client at a competitive disadvantage and therefore the long term goal should be to reduce costs and return prices to normal. The client can look to reduce costs by:\n\nConducting a “carton-size study” to determine the optimal assortment of boxes used\nLook to expand the distribution network to also ship items from locations in the east and west coast\nNegotiate lower shipping costs with the vendor\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Based in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, CVS is the second largest US pharmacy chain based on total prescription revenue, after leading competitor Walgreens (NYSE: WAG). CVS sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of general merchandise, including over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, beauty products and cosmetics, film and photo finishing services, seasonal merchandise, greeting cards, and convenience foods.\nThe client CVS had been enjoying growing sales over the past 12 months, significantly increasing its market share over the period. Recently, however, the CEO of CVS has become increasingly concerned about a declining trend in overall profit. He has approached our firm in order to help him determine the reasons for the decline in overall profit as well as recommendations on appropriate actions. What recommendation would you give him?\nAdditional Information: (Provide the following information if requested by interviewee)\n\nThe overall pharmacy/drugstore market in the U.S. has also experienced stable growth, although at a slower pace  \nThe client’s market share has grown at a steady rate\nThere have been no significant changes in the competitive landscape over the past 12 months (marketing, new products/services, new entrants, substitutes, etc.)\nCVS Pharmacy’s prices have not changed over the past 12 months\nCVS Pharmacy’s sales quantities have increased over the past 12 months\nCVS Pharmacy’s costs have not changed over the past 12 months\nDemand, income and consumer needs have not changed over the past 12 months\nCVS Pharmacy has introduced a whole series of complementary convenience products and generic drugs over the past six months\n\nPossible Answer:\nI. Areas of Discussion\n1. The drugstore market:\nCompetitors:\n\nSales\nMarket share\nSubstitutes\n\nConsumers:\n\nChanges in demand\nChanges in purchasing behavior\nChanges in income\n\n2. The client CVS Pharmacy:\nProfit model:\n\nRevenues (price and quantity)\nCosts\n\n3. Other/Macro-economic factors\n\nGovernment, regulations & taxes\nEconomic trends\n\nII. Recommended Conclusion\nThe client CVS Pharmacy’s product mix has recently shifted from being based on high-margin/price prescription drugs to generic OTC drugs and convenience store items, both of which are lower-margin/price. This explains its decline in profit while increasing market share.\nIn order to increase profits, recommended solutions may include changes in product mix (balance high-margin prescription drugs with generics), bundling of higher margin products with low margin ones, introduction of complementary services, opening new stores in profitable locations, introducing an online and delivery store, and even reducing costs to become more profitable (closing down under-performing stores, reducing personnel, sourcing, etc.).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Through its wholly owned subsidiaries, the company engages in the manufacture and sale of consumer healthcare products, generic prescription drugs, active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), and consumer products primarily in the United States, Australia, Israel, Europe, India and Mexico.\nThe client has two major products: big line and small line. Overall, the trends in the over-the-counter pharmaceuticals industry are uninspiring. The client is experiencing flat growth in revenues and costs are creeping upward. You have been hired by the CEO of Perrigo Company to help them improve bottom line. How would you go about this case?\nPossible Answer:\nInterviewee: So I assume that means we’re seeing a decline in the client’s profitability?\nInterviewer: Yes, that’s a good assumption.\nInterviewee: OK, then I will do a profit tree.\nMarket and Customer\n\ncustomer preferences\nclient’s share of the market\nanything new in the pipeline\ncompetitors in the OTC market\n\nAsked about products themselves.

Total market size is flat and client’s share is also flat.\nAt this point, the interviewee should then analyze costs.\nSuggested that fixed costs are R&D, production, labor, Manufacturing. Variable costs could be raw materials and distribution.\nThe interviewer can provide the following additional info:\n\nProduct A has gross margin of 40%, fixed costs of $180 M\nProduct B has gross margin of 60%, fixed costs of $70 M\n\nUsing this information, the interviewee could calculate total margins by multiplying percentages by total revenue.\n\nProduct A: Profits = revenues – costs = 40% * (1/3) * $1.2 B – $180 M = -$20 M\nProduct B: Profits = revenues – costs = 60% * $150 M – $70 M = $20 M\n\nWe see that Product A is netting -$20 M, and Product B is netting $20 M.\nTo improve profits, the client could either try increasing revenues or decreasing costs. Possible options: sell more, increase prices, diversify product line, synergies between the two products, increase geographic scope, acquire competitor, etc.\nThe interviewer would reveal that none of the options were good, but the final recommendation is to shut down Product A. This answer was the last resort option and could only be reached by exhausting all possible avenues.\nHow much additional revenue would you need to make Product A profitable? Calculated that and concluded that an extra $50 M in revenue would break even.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: operations strategy.\nConsulting Firm: Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: government & public sector.\nCase Interview Question #00735: In August of 2005, hurricane Katrina hit the southern coast of the United States, turning into the most economically damaging and fifth deadliest in history. At least 1,833 people died in the hurricane and subsequent floods. Total property damage was estimated at $108 billion (2005 USD). The most severe loss of life and property damage occurred in New Orleans, Louisiana, which flooded as the levee system catastrophically failed. Eventually 80% of the city became flooded and also large tracts of neighboring parishes and the floodwaters lingered for weeks.\nAs part of an effort to prevent similar disasters in the future, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has approached our consulting firm in order to develop a strategic plan to help prevent such impact the next time  a nature phenomenon like hurricane Katrina occurs. How might you approach this problem?\nAdditional Information: (Provide the following information if requested by interviewee)\nThe below information will help focus the interviewee on specific elements of the answer after they have had a chance to lay out their own thinking. \n\nEconomic assistance and funds are provided at the state and federal levels.\nFederal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) usually structures their plans in four dimensions: Preparation, Response, Recovery and Mitigation.\nOur project should concentrate on Mitigation, meaning how to mitigate the impact of future disasters.\n\nPossible Answer:\n1. Areas of Discussion\nFour major areas should be discussed:\n\nIdentify the risks.\nAssess, quantify and prioritize impacts to mitigate\nDetermine plan to mitigate risk\nImplement: Training, Communication, Raise awareness\n\n2. Recommended Conclusion\nThis is not a typical business case where traditional “profitability” or “introducing new product” frameworks can be used. It is important not to try to force-fit the standard frameworks, but rather think about the problem in terms of the information you were given and the problem that needs to be solved. Even more than other cases, this case does not have one single right answer; however some approaches have been discussed below.\nThe first phase of the case (before interviewee has been given focus on the mitigation piece) is an opportunity for the interviewee to exhibit structured thinking and sound process approach, there is no right answer. More important is whether the interviewee proposes a logical approach to the problem that covered a broad range of relevant considerations:\nOnce the interviewee has been told to focus on Mitigation, generally their approach should follow a sequence along the lines of: Identify, Assess, Plan, Communicate / implement.\nIdentify:\n\nList out potential natural disasters (not only hurricanes) and risks associated with each.\nInventory of current state of infrastructure: levee, potential refugee centers (i.e. Astrodome)\n\nAssess:\n\nOut of the potential disasters, consider which one is most likely and should be prioritized for planning purposes.\nOut of the risks associated with each disaster, prioritize those risks across all potential disasters that have maximum risk.\n\nPlan:\n\nRaise necessary funds to invest in infrastructure, communication, etc.\nIdentify key suppliers and other resources that can be mobilized in the event of emergency.\nCreate a structured plan to address and communicate the risks and solutions identified.\n\nCommunicate:\n\nRaise awareness within the general public; as well as institutions and partners: state, federal, NGO’s, private companies, media, etc.\nUse tools such as schools, media public announcements, celebrities, etc. in order to create awareness.\nEstablish a conference to gather, align and integrate all parties.\nPotential of using Global Warming awareness as an issue to further leverage message.\n\nA Second Approach:\n1) Determine the objectives and priorities of the Client (FEMA)\na. Reduce casualties\nb. Reduce damage to property\n2) Understand the various types of disasters that must be considered\na. Earthquate\nb. Hurricanes\n3) Casualties\na. Identify the most common causes of death and the number of people at risk\nb. Evaluate the possible mitigating actions (prevent risk, or mitigate once risk comes to pass)\nc. Implement/communicate plans\n4) Property damage/other losses\na. Identify causes\nb. Prioritize and plan\nc. Implement/ communicate\n5) Other considerations\na. Flexibility of response with changing conditions\nb. Reliability of suppliers\nc. Effectiveness of communication\nd. Chain of command \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The firm specializes in leveraged buyout transactions and purchases of distressed securities involving corporate restructuring, special situations, and industry consolidations. Apollo is headquartered in New York City, and also has offices in Purchase, New York, Los Angeles, Houston, London, Frankfurt, Luxemburg, Singapore, Hong Kong and Mumbai.\nApollo Global Management has purchased a U.S. plastic materials manufacturer that makes products such as plastic soda bottles. The client Apollo is looking to cash out of their investment within 5 years and are looking to you to help them improve the profitability of the plastic materials manufacturer. What would you recommend to the client?\nAdditional Information: (Provide the following information if requested by interviewee.)\n1. Products \nThe plastic materials manufacturer’s products can split into two lines: bottles and non-bottling goods.\n\nThe bottles are delivered locally to their clients, large bottlers such as Coke or Pepsi.\nNon-bottling products (such as advertising displays for stores) are delivered directly to the establishments that will use them, such as gas stations. Bottles are made to spec whereas the non-bottling goods are not.\n\n2. Manufacturing\nThe plastic materials company has two plants:\n\none in the southeast U.S. that manufactures only bottles with capacity of 1.5 billion bottles\none in Canada that produces bottles and non-bottling materials with a capacity of 500 million bottles\n\nAssumptions:\n\nNo downtime in manufacturing, both plants are fully utilized.\nPlants are using new, highly efficient machinery.\n\nThe Canadian plant can convert the non-bottling production to bottling to add 500 Million in capacity to bottle production. Cost of conversion is $3 M.\nPossible Answer:\n1. Costs / Revenues Analysis\na. Revenues\n\nBottles sell for $0.05 each and utilization is currently at 100% for the two factories.\nNon-Bottling generates $20M in revenues\n\nb. Costs\n\nFor each bottle: $0.02 for plastic, $0.01 for machinery, and $0.005 for labor cost (The interviewer should be prompted to provide potential variable costs).\nNon-bottling has total variable costs of $18M\nSG&A across the entire company is $20 M\n\nc. Margin calculation\n\nBottles have 30% margin as they make $0.015 per bottle: (Price – Variable Costs) / Price = ($0.05 – $0.035) / $0.05 = 0.3 = 30%\nNon-bottling generates 10% margins: ($20M – $18M) / $20M = 0.1 = 10%\n\n2. After exploring costs, revenues, and margins, the interviewee should assess whether or not to convert the Canadian plant to bottles only. They should calculate additional profit after conversion to determine if it is worth the $3 M conversion cost:\n\nCurrent profit from non-bottling in Canada: $20 M – $18 M = $2 M\nProjected profit from additional bottling capacity in Canada: 500 M bottles * $0.015 margin per bottle = $7.5 M\nConversion adds $7.5 M – $2 M = $5.5 M in gross profit annually: breakeven in 1 year\n\nNote:\n\nAssume no downtime for conversion.\nIf asked about financing, the client Apollo Global Management has sufficient cash on hand to fund the conversion and the interviewee does not need to discount the cash flows.\n\n3. Market / Sales Growth\n\nBottling market is growing at 10% a year in North America; for purposes of the case assume that both plants can service the entire market.\nThe plastic materials company’s sales has been growing at 15% per year, and is projected a 15% growth for next year as well.\nThe plastic materials company has 30% share of bottling market.\nThe plastic materials company has higher quality products and manufactures at lower costs due to more efficient machinery.\n\nThe interviewee should then calculate total market size and projected market expansion next year given the 10% growth rate. He/she should use this with projected firm sales growth (15%) to assess feasibility of selling additional volume produced by expanding production capacity through Canadian plant conversion.\n\nUsing market share and production levels, calculate total market size: 30% * market = 2 Billion bottles; Total market = 6.67 Billion bottles\nProjected market growth = 6.67 B * 10% = 0.67 B\nFirm’s projected sales = current sales + 15% growth = 2 B * (1 + 0.15) = 2.3 B bottles\nFirm’s sales will be growing by 0.3 B bottles and market expanding by 0.67 B.\n\nNote:\n\nThe interviewee should comment on feasibility\nThe interviewee could support feasibility argument by looking at required market share to continue sales growth: 2.3 / 6.67 = 34% or roughly 1/3 of market instead of the current 30%.\n\n4. Recommendations\nThe plastic materials manufacturer should convert their non-bottling manufacturing in Canada to bottling as it offers better margins, assuming they can maintain sales growth. The additional capacity is needed to match next year’s anticipated demand. The firm will still run out of capacity the year after, so one consideration would be adding another plant or expanding existing plants to extend production capacity to keep pace with the market growth. Expansion plans should fit within the PE firm’s goal of exiting within 5 years. Other considerations:\n\nNegotiate with suppliers / customers\nIncrease prices due to higher quality products\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: industry analysis; math problem.\nConsulting Firm: IBM Global Business Services (GBS) first round summer internship job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: telecommunications & network.\nCase Interview Question #00711: Our client Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO) is a diversified technology corporation producing primarily telecommunications support equipment. With its headquarter located in San Jose, California, United States, Cisco designs, manufactures, and sells telecommunications infrastructure and networking equipment. The company’s current portfolio of products and services is focused upon three market segments – Enterprise and Service Provider, Small Business, and the Home.\nYou have been hired by the CEO of Cisco to evaluate a product known as “Core Control”. This product handles basic call connectivity—recognizing phone numbers dialed and connecting outgoing calls to recipients. The customers of this product are AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile and the like, and our client Cisco competes against companies like Lucent and Alcatel for sales. This is an IP-driven business, and the market has experienced a significant downturn in the last year.\nThe CEO of Cisco has asked your consulting team to evaluate the future of the “Core Control” product line. How would you approach this case?\nPossible Answer:\nThe interviewee should quickly identify that this is a mature product and choose a framework that identifies the potential issues. One approach may look like this (3C’s):\n1. Company\na. What is Cisco’s strategy? Where does Core Control fit?\nb. How lean is Core Control? A mature industry often requires price leadership.\nc. What are the financials of Core Control product? Are we making money?\nd. What is Core Control’s outlook:\n\ncan we sell it off?\ncan we milk it to fund R&D of new technology?\ncan we bundle Core Control with a more profitable service?\nshould we cut our losses?\n\n2. Competition\na. Who are they?\nb. Are they taking market share or leaving this declining market?\nc. How easily will they cede market share to us?\nd. Do they have advantages over us (cost leadership; brand strength; customer relations)?\n3. Customers\na. Who are they?\nb. Why aren’t they buying IP components (new technology, declining industry)?\nc. Can we grow the market?\nQuestion #2: The CEO of Cisco wants to use Core Control revenues to fund new R&D. Last year, our client earned 15% EBIT on revenue of $8 billion from Core Control. This year, our client’s revenues are expected to decrease with the market rate (quantified: Year 1 = $50 billion; Year 2 = $25 billion). You’ve been asked to come up with a rough estimate of what the business might look like this year from a financial standpoint, and offer some thoughts on what this could mean going forward.\nPossible Answer:\nThis is primarily a “numbers case”, with the underlying exercise of estimating a cost structure. The essential task of this case is to estimate a cost structure for this year, determine what the EBIT will be, and discuss what this could mean for the business going forward. The interviewee’s thought process in allocating costs is a crucial component of evaluation, and should involve some discussion of how and why he/she decides to allocate costs into the respective line items.\nRevenues\nVery simply, the interviewee can assume that revenues will decrease by the market downturn, i.e. 50%, from $8 billion to approximately $4 billion.\nCosts\nInterviewee should begin by identifying the following basic costs items (he/she can identify others, but if so, interviewer should suggest that he/she bucket them into the following 4 basic items):\n\nCoGS: Cost of goods sold\nR&D: research & development\nS&M: sales & marketing cost\nG&A: general and administrative expense\n\nA logical next step would be for the interviewee to determine the total costs from last year:\nEBIT was 15%, so total costs were 85% of sales, or $8 billion * 85% = $6.8 billion\nThe interviewer should then ask how these total costs might have been allocated to the 4 basic costs items. One useful method is to first estimate how much each cost item will be as a % of sales (with total costs summing to 85% of sales). General breakdown should roughly align with:\n\nCoGS = 50% of sales\nR&D = 20% of sales\nS&M = 10% of sales\nG&A = 5% of sales\n\nGeneric logic behind this reasoning:\n\nCoGS will be largest cost item.\nSince product is “IP-driven,” R&D will be next biggest expense.\nS&M and G&A will be smallest cost items.\n\nAs long as the interviewee defends his/her reasoning, these percentages can be more/less than specified above.\nNext, using these %’s, the interviewee can derive actual cost amounts for last year (total costs = $6.8b):\n\nCoGS = 50% x $8b = $4.0b\nR&D = 20% x $8b = $1.6b\nS&M = 10% x $8b = $0.8b\nG&A = 5% x $8b = $0.4b\n\nTo extrapolate costs to this year, the interviewee should separate the above costs as fixed or variable (interviewer should prompt the interviewee to do so if not done on their own):\n\nAll or significant majority of CoGS will be variable (i.e. some small portion of CoGS may not vary with sales).\nAll or significant majority of R&D will be fixed.\nAll or significant majority of S&M and G&A will be fixed (i.e. some small portion of S&M may vary with sales).\n\nNext, interviewee should split the calculated costs into fixed vs. variable costs. Exact cost breakdown will vary, but should fall within basic parameters outlined above (i.e. majority fixed vs. variable, or vice versa). For example:\n\nCoGS = $3.8 (variable) + $0.2 (fixed) = $4.0b\nR&D = $1.6 (fixed) = $1.6b\nS&M = $0.6 (fixed) + $0.2 (variable) = $0.8b\nG&A = $0.4 (fixed) = $0.4b\n\nThus, the interviewee will have derived (or thereabouts):\n\n$4.0b in variable costs\n$2.8b in fixed costs\n\nThe interviewee can then derive EBIT for this year.\nWith the 50% decrease in revenue, variable costs will also decrease by 50%, with fixed costs remaining the same. Thus:\n\n$2.0b in variable costs, $2.8b in fixed costs.\n$4.8b in total costs\nEBIT = $4.8b – $4.0b = ($0.8)b\n\n3. Conclusion: Now that you have evaluated the outlook for Core Control, how would you advise the CEO of Cisco to proceed from here?\nPossible Answer:\nBased on costs and revenue, the interviewee should find that the Core Control business will lose money this year.\nThe interviewee should provide commentary (outside of limited case facts) about why it may or may not be a good idea to get out of this business, such as:\n\nmarket downturn could be an indication of the product’s obsolescence.\nsince this is an IP-driven business, business is cyclical and this year’s investment in R&D could generate a rebound next year.\n\nThe interviewee should also propose modifying the cost structure. Answers will vary, but the focus of this case in the EBIT calculation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: growth.\nConsulting Firm: Siemens Management Consulting (SMC) first round summer internship job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: environment & waste management; conglomerate.\nCase Interview Question #00709: Our client is Siemens AG (FWB: SIE, NYSE: SI), a large diversified international conglomerate headquartered in Munich, Germany, with businesses in the telecom, medical, automotive, and power generation industries, among others. Siemens’ principal activities are in the fields of industry, energy, transportation and healthcare. It is organized into five main sectors: Industry, Energy, Healthcare, Infrastructure & Cities, and Siemens Financial Services (SFS). Siemens and its subsidiaries employ approximately 360,000 people across nearly 190 countries and reported global revenue of approx 73.5 billion Euros for the year of 2011.\nThe client Siemens has recently acquired U.S. Filter Corporation, a California-based U.S. company that handles waste management  and filtration of water. The U.S. water treatment market is large ($400 billion annually), and very fragmented (the number one player has $2 billion in turnover). Our client Siemens has asked us to develop a growth strategy for this “water management” subsidiary U.S. Filter Corporation. How would you approach this problem?\nAdditional Information: Provide the following information if requested\n1. Products\nU.S. Filter Corporation and its competitors offer four basic products & services:\n\nOff-the-shelf devices and system components: anything from a simple household water filtration device you could buy in a hardware store, to a more sophisticated product for use in a plant.\nComplete water filtration/management system installation.\nOperations, i.e. system operated by the company for its customer.\nService, i.e. after installation, service provided to system as necessary.\n\nThe four products each have different profit margins:\n\nDevices and components = 20% EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes)\nComplete systems = 10% EBIT\nOperations = 50% EBIT\nService = 30% EBIT\n\nInterviewee should follow up by asking about the revenues associated with these four products, which are very different:\n\nOff-the-shelf devices / components = $20 – $20,000 per sale\nComplete system = $20m for one-time installation on average. (note: larger projects can be more, smaller can be less)\nOperations = $5m in revenue per year on average. (note: larger projects can be more, smaller can be less)\nService = variable, dependent on installation (generally < $1m)\n\n2. Customers\nThere are three basic customers of these water systems:\n\nMunicipal, i.e. City of New York.\nIndustrial, i.e. corporations, plants.\nResidential, i.e. households, apartment complexes.\n\nInterviewee should deduce, through questions or assumptions that:\n\nMunicipal customers are the largest projects, and thus largest revenue streams.\nIndustrial can be medium to large projects.\nResidential are smallest projects, and generate low revenue.\n\nThe interviewee should also determine that each customer demands different product types. Interviewer can direct interviewee towards this information with leading questions such as:\n\nWhat might be some other differences between these customer segments?\nCould these different customer segments have different needs?\n\nOnce the interviewee identifies that “customers will demand different products”, the interviewer should provide the following:\n\nmunicipalities demand components and operations only (since systems are already in place).\nindustrial corporations need components, complete systems, and operations.\nresidential requires off-the-shelf components only.\nAll customers are likely to need service, residential to a lesser extent.\n\nLastly, the interviewee should be told that the growth rates in each of these customer segments are as follows:\n\nmunicipal = 5%\nindustrial = 35%\nresidential = 25%\n\n3. Market\nWhile the client Siemens AG is international, this case focuses on the U.S. market only, so should the interviewee ask, limit growth strategy to U.S. market (although suggestions of pursuing opportunities abroad are not “wrong”, per se).\nPossible Answer:\nA typical good growth strategy for U.S. Filter Corporation will focus on industrial clients, providing complete systems and operations. The interviewee should identify that systems and operations have sales synergies—at least that it is a natural strategy to leverage the sale of an installed complete systems to market the sale of operations services.\nAdditional growth strategy will include provision of operations services to municipalities. While municipal market only growing at 5%, there are large existing installations, and operations services on these will generate significant revenues and high EBIT.\nThe interviewee should identify residential market as least desirable. Although growth is high in this segment, since the demand here is only for low-revenue components, growth strategy should not include this segment.\nInterviewee should also recognize that service, despite 30% EBIT, is an add-on sale that will exist regardless of strategy taken.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The company purchases fabric in bulk from overseas and then dyes batches of fabric in colors ordered by clients. It produces 1.4 million square meters of product each month and its average variable cost is $0.60 per square meter.\nProcessed batches have the following distribution:\n\n40% of the batches are greater than 5,000 square meters\n30% of the batches are between 3,000 and 5,000 square meters\n30% of the batches are less than 3,000 square meters\n\nRobert Kaufman Fabrics uses two different processes to dye its fabrics:\n\nContinuous Dyeing: where washing and dyeing are integrated in a continuous process. This process is used for 70% of the company’s production and is cheaper for batches of over 5,000 square meters.\nBatch Processing: in which the washing and dyeing machines are independent. The machines in this line need to be set up prior to each batch being processed. Batch processing is used with the remaining production and is cheaper for batches under 5,000 square meters. If a batch has to be processed using a more expensive process, the cost is $0.05 per square meter.\n\nOur client Robert Kaufman Fabrics has asked us to recommend how it might reduce its total costs. How would you approach this problem?\nAdditional Information: Provide the following information if requested \n1. Client orders\nRobert Kaufman Fabrics’ clients usually make one or two orders during a month. Those orders are aggregated and usually fulfilled within 15 days. If the interviewee wants to progress this issue, advise him/her that the 15 day fill time is not crucial to customers, they are okay with having orders filled within a month.\n2. Processes\nThe set-up time for the Batch process machine is one hour and the installed capacity for that process is 700,000 square meters/month (assuming no setup downtime).\nPossible Answer:\nThe variable cost curve for the two processes can be represented as follows (Figure 1).\n\nIn other words, it is more expensive for the company to process batches under 5,000 square meters in size via the continuous dyeing.\nThe interviewee should calculate the monthly production of 1.4 million square meters is currently being split into batches as follows:\n\nbatches less than 3,000 square meters = 30% of 1.4m = 420,000 square meters\nbatches between 3,000 and 5,000 square meters = 30% of 1.4m = 420,000 square meters\nbatches greater than 5,000 square meters = 40% of 1.4m = 560,000 square meters\n\nHe/she should also calculate that currently the company is processing 70% x 1.4 million = 980,000 square meters of fabric using the continuous dyeing process.\nThis means that the company is incurring an over-cost of $0.05 x (980,000 – 560,000) = $21,000 per month by having to use the continuous dyeing process for batches smaller than 5,000 square meters.\nThe interviewee should be able to infer that this means that the Batch Processing machines are working at full capacity. Given the total capacity of the Batch processing process is 700,000 square meters/month and only 420,000 square meters/month (1,400,000 – 980,000) are produced, that means that part of the time the machine is not producing because of set-up time. In fact we can calculate that 60% (700,000 / 420,000) of the time the machine is producing and 40% of the time it’s being set-up.\nRecommendation to reduce costs:\nHaving identified the nature of the problem, the interviewee should turn to recommending a solution.\n1. One option is to buy another Batch Process machine. Even optimizing production, the 40% non-producing time won’t be enough to accommodate the additional 420,000 square meters/month that should be produced via Batch Processing. Only one machine is needed since the larger orders would need less set-ups than the <3,000 square meters batches.\nIf the interviewee reaches this point, the interviewer might ask them the following additional question: What would be the maximum price to pay for the new Batch Process machine, knowing that the discount rate for the company is 10%?\nPossible Answer:\nAssuming perpetual life for the new machine, the maximum price is $2,520,000 ($21,000 * 12 / 10%).\n2. A second option involves considering client needs and in particular their willingness to accept longer order fulfillment time. If that is possible, order aggregation is possible and thus, larger batches can be processed. This is likely to avoid the need to purchase an extra machine. Larger batches will be processed using the continuous dyeing technology that seems to be the most cost efficient.\nFurther recommendations for creating larger batches include:\n\nintegrating planning processes with clients;\ntraining the sales force to encourage order optimization;\ndesigning incentives for both clients and the sales force.\n\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

It was formed through the combination of the corporate and investment banking activities of Bank of America and Merrill Lynch following the acquisition of the latter by the former in January 2009.\nYou are a junior Equity Research Analyst recently hired by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. On your first day of work, your manager wants to see how good your financial statement analysis skills are. Here is information about three companies A, B, and C. What can you make of this data? And can you determine what type of industry each company is in?\n\n\n\n\nNet Income After Taxes\nRevenues\nAssets\nLiabilities\nEquity\n\n\nCompany A\n254M\n2.6B\n2.8B\n1.0B\n1.8B\n\n\nCompany B\n7B\n77B\n1.121T\n1.085T\n35B\n\n\nCompany C\n11B\n348B\n151B\n89B\n61B\n\n\n\nPossible Answer:\nThis is a mini case about accounting and financial statement analysis. If the interviewee is absolutely stuck, lead him/her to  calculate Return On Assets (ROA), Return On Equity (ROE), Net Profit Margin, Debt-to-Assets Ratio, Debt-to-Equity Ratio, etc. The Current Ratio cannot be calculated here because Total Assets and Liabilities are provided, as opposed to Current Assets and Liabilities.\nAfter calculations are complete, have the interviewee interpret the data.

However, it has the lowest ROE, Debt-to-Assets ratio, and Debt-to-Equity Ratio. This suggests that Company A is perhaps a low volume, high margin store, such as a jewelry store. (Company A is in fact Tiffany & Company).\nCompany B has the highest ROE, and Debt-to-Equity is out the roof! Additionally, it has the highest Debt-to-Assets ratio, so it uses a lot of Debt, increasing the firm’s risk-exposure. Company B has the lowest ROA among the companies. Assets and Liabilities are pretty equal. All of this suggests that Company B may be a financial institution of some kind. (Company B is in fact Morgan Stanley).\nCompany C has the lowest Net Profit Margin, and Assets are almost twice the Liabilities. This suggests that Company C is a high volume, low margin store, like a retailer of some kind. (Company C is in fact Wal-Mart). \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Little first round summer internship job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: Publishing, Mass Media & Communications; online business.\nCase Interview Question #00713: The client Condé Nast is a division of Advance Publications, a mass media company headquartered in New York City, United States. As one of the major magazine publishers in the U.S., the company owns 20 print and digital media brands, including  Allure, Architectural Digest, Ars Technica, Bon Appétit, Brides, Glamour, Golf Digest, Golf World, GQ, Lucky, The New Yorker, Self, Teen Vogue, Vanity Fair, Vogue, W and Wired.\nIn the last few years, Condé Nast has seen their circulation drop and their ad revenue drop. They currently have $700M in revenue spread across three types of magazines: fashion and beauty for teens, fashion and beauty for women ages 24-40, and specialty magazines with 10-20K in subscribers. Their online presence generates $21M in advertising revenue (of the total $700M) and $9M in profit. They have brought us in to try to solve their circulation problem and possibly boost their ad revenues. (For the interviewer: the real question at hand is, how can we improve profitability for this client and adapt to the current marketplace?) How would you go about this case?\nAdditional Information: (Provide the following information if requested by interviewee)\n\nViewers and advertisers are both moving online. The client Condé Nast’s two major competitors have both invested a lot of money in online initiatives.\nCurrent online operations: they use a partner that charges them a portion of the hosting costs. They do not have complete control over what ads are being shown with their online contents.\n\nPossible Solution:\n1. Areas of Discussion\n\nShould the client be more aggressive online and what capabilities do they need?\nBrainstorm a bit about what else you could do other than simply moving your content to a web server.\n\n2. Recommended Conclusion\nThe interviewee should not immediately jump to the conclusion that the online portion of the business is the cause of the problem (although this turns out to be the case, they should note that the proportion of revenue from online activities is relatively small). Otherwise, the answer is fairly open-ended, but should show an understanding of technology. Topics the interviewee should address include:\nIT Organization – It is not enough to mention that they will need “IT people” – a better answer might be “a designer that is well-versed in web-design software but will also be able to create an online presence with a consistent look with the print magazine”.\nProject Phasing – Recognize the difficulty of launching new IT projects by suggesting that since there are so many magazines in the publishing company’s portfolio, moving these magazines online could be done in a phased manner, perhaps by doing trial runs with the specialty magazines before moving on to their more valuable brands.\nVendor Relationships – Evaluate other hosting options or solutions. If the client is dependent on a 3rd party service provider, can they bring the hosting in-house? Or issue an RFP for a new provider with more favorable contract terms?\nSources of Revenue – Is the client currently charging consumers for access to their online portal? How do they track usage and unique visitors? The interviewee should explore whether the client leverage new advertisers to reach the customers who are “really” using their online channel.\nFor the brainstorming component, the interviewee should mention the ability to cross-sell magazines across demographics and the opportunities for mass customization.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

(NYSE: AGN), a global specialty pharmaceutical company focusing on five areas: ophthalmic pharmaceuticals, dermatology, neuroscience, urology and cosmetics. The company produces neurologic product, Botox, which is used around the world to treat a variety of debilitating disorders associated with muscle overactivity. In cosmetic applications, a Botox injection can be used to prevent development of wrinkles by paralyzing facial muscles.\nMigraine is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent moderate to severe headaches often in association with a number of autonomic nervous system symptoms. Typically the headache affects one half of the head, is pulsating in nature, and lasting from 2 to 72 hours. Associated symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, sound, or smell.\nRecently, your client Allergan is considering expanding to the migraine market and has already begun clinical trials in this arena. Their product is scheduled to launch in 2015. What is your estimate for the size of the migraine market and the potential revenue?\nAdditional Information:\nThe product is given in the form of an injection every 2 months. It offers similar efficacy compared to existing options but without any side effects. When given for migraines it does have some of the added skin care benefits it is commonly associated with.\nPossible Answer:\n1. Analysis\nSizing the market:\n\nPopulation\n% of population diagnosed with migraines\n% treated with OTC (over the counter) vs. prescription medications\n% that have severe migraines\nExpected share for the product\n\nBecause the product requires an injection versus the current oral medication it requires more hassle and thus will most likely be reserved for the most severe of patients. When moving to revenue the interviewee should discuss potential issues involved in pricing such as:\n\nInsurance coverage\nPatients’ willingness to pay more than they currently are\nInconvenience of MD visits for injections\nSkin care benefits from Botox\nThe market leader in traditional prescription migraine treatments, Immitrex, lost patent protection in last December and thus there will be very cheap alternatives available in the market. This should be mostly bonus points but the interviewee could raise the issue of generic competition for existing products or ask if generics exist.\n\nUltimately, the interviewer states that the client is going to price the drug at $200 per injection. Therefore the therapy costs $1,200 per year and that is multiplied by the expected number of patients that will receive Botox for migraines to get the annual revenue estimate.\nAdditional Question:\nHow might the launch of Botox for migraines affect their existing business in plastic surgery and should the client launch under a separate brand name in the migraine market?\nPossible Answer:\nLaunching under the same brand name Botox could cause a public outcry over the discrepancy in price between the migraine version and the plastic surgery version given they are the identical drug. Also, it could cause some patients to use the migraine form instead of buying the plastic surgery version, thus cannibalizing some of the existing sales of Botox. On the other hand, keeping the Botox brand name brings with it the strong reputation Botox has already built through its current use.\nLaunching under another brand name would allow the client to more effectively differentiate between the two uses when advertising the product to consumers and physicians. It would also likely lessen the backlash from the differential pricing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Mead Johnson is a major manufacturer of infant formula both domestically and globally with its flagship product Enfamil. The company had global sales of $2.83 billion in 2009, with two-thirds of its revenue coming from outside the United States.\nThe year is 2011. Recent economic crisis has generated a need to drastically reduce costs in order to maintain the client firm’s future competitiveness. The senior executive team of Mead Johnson has come up with a cost reduction goal of $500 million by year 2015. Since the company expects to growth its sales over the period, it has been determined that core activities such as production plans, sales, and marketing should not be affected/touched by this cost cutting initiative.\nThe CFO of Mead Johnson, who is responsible for the initiative, has approached our firm in order to develop a comprehensive understanding of cost reduction alternatives, as well as a recommendation on what would be the appropriate approach/steps to execute this initiative. Finally, he has asked for input on who should be involved in this initiative. What would you tell him?\nPossible Answer:\n1. Areas of Discussion\na. Potential opportunities:\n\nDirect productivity improvement due to workload imbalances\nTechnology implementations that would reduce manual work\nMove selected operations (accounting, finance, etc.) to low-cost locations\nOutsource selected operations (call centers, transactional work)\nConsolidate office locations to reduce/distribute fixed costs\nEliminate excessive organizational levels\nEliminate low added-value work\nImplement a supplier consolidation process to achieve better COGS\n\nb. Approach to implement:\n\nForm a team\nCreate incentives to promote results/collaboration\nUnderstand the opportunities (list them out, size them, get the data)\nBenchmark with other companies and initiatives\nRestore areas that are not performing as designed\nEliminate/change areas that are performing as designed, but still have opportunity areas\nImplement, adjust and correct\n\nc. Who should be involved:\n\nFunctional experts\nSupport from upper management\nCustomers, both external (suppliers, consumers, etc.) and internal\nFunctional areas impacted by changes\n\n2. Recommended Conclusion\nThis cost reduction case is a higher-level strategic analysis, and as such could have multiple answers. A strong recommendation would include a sufficiently exhaustive analysis of all three areas requested by the client (opportunities, approach and involvement), including ideas that might not be implemented. Once all ideas have been laid out, the candidate should select one or various and propose them as a sound recommendation. For instance, a candidate might recommend reducing organizational layers/levels, to eliminate non-added-value work and balance workload as a first “low hanging fruit” stage. But since this course of action is unlikely to deliver $500 million in savings, this recommendation should be complemented with more extensive efforts, such as moving work to low-cost locations, outsourcing, implementing technology to simplify/eliminate work, or consolidate suppliers to reduce COGS.\nIn terms of the appropriate steps to be followed, the outline above is based on Six-Sigma and Organizational Change models, and although the approach does not have to necessarily be exactly the same, it should include key areas such as creating a responsible team, benchmarking, incentives, and the implementation/correction cycle.\nAs for who should be involved, key players to consider include subject/area experts, clients, and management commitment and involvement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: operations strategy, optimization.\nConsulting Firm: IMS Health Consulting Group first round summer internship job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: healthcare: pharmaceutical, biotech, life sciences.\nCase Interview Question #00727: Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) is a U.S. pharmaceutical company headquartered in New York City, NY. The firm manufactures prescription pharmaceuticals in several therapeutic areas, including cancer, HIV/AIDS, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hepatitis, rheumatoid arthritis and psychiatric disorders. Your client for this case  is the Chief Scientific Officer of Bristol-Myers Squibb who is in charge of the company’s research and development.\nCurrently, Bristol-Myers Squibb’s R&D process works like this: the company’s satellite research labs located all over the country send potential drug compounds to a centralized analysis center. Analysis center draws blood from animals, do all the testing work, analyzes the results, and then sends results back to satellite research lab – this is an iterative process for each drug compound (5 to 15 reviews per compound). 15 year patent begins after the 1st review/iteration if the compound passes initial tests during the 1st review/iteration. There tends to be a long queue of potential drug compounds waiting to be analyzed.\nYour client, the Chief Scientific Officer of Bristol-Myers Squibb, wants to reduce the R&D cycle time. What are ways to reduce the cycle time and what are the benefits to the company of doing so?\nAdditional Information: (Provide the following information if requested by interviewee)\n\nThe company’s centralized analysis center recently hired more people (can also think about increasing capacity at the analysis center), but cycle time did not change.\nThe research scientists at the company’s satellite research labs heard that more people were hired at the analysis center, so they sent more drug compounds.\nNumber of compounds that passed the 1st review did not increase.\nScientists are starting sending low quality compounds (likelihood of going to market is very low) and queue remained long.\nScientists can usually predict the likelihood of each compound passing the 1st review.\nThere was no prioritization of the queue – it was first come, first serve.\n\nPossible Answer:\nThe interviewee should come up with the idea of “prioritizing drug compounds”.\nPrioritize compounds: by using previous results or scientist’s confidence of passing review a compounds with highest likelihood of going to market should jump the queue. This discouraged scientists from sending low quality compounds. Note that the specific method of prioritization is less important than understanding the need to prioritize.\nOnce the interviewee determines that prioritization is needed, the interviewer should provide the following information, and ask the interviewee to quantify the R&D cycle time decrease.\nCurrently:\n\n30% of compounds require 15 cycles\n70% of compounds require 5 cycles\n\nAfter the prioritization:\n\nCycle time was 3.5 weeks per iteration, went down to 2 weeks.\n\nHow many weeks on average will this save per compound?\nPossible Answer:\n(15 cycles * 30% + 5 cycles * 70%) * (3.5 – 2) weeks/cycle = 12 weeks\nRecommendation\nThe interviewee should translate R&D cycle time decrease into business implications.\nBy prioritizing drug compounds, it will save 12 weeks for an average compound. If a drug ever goes to market, 12 weeks of revenue is captured. The key issue is that revenue for a drug has a short life, based on the 15 year patent. Adding 12 weeks of revenue is a significant increase to the company’s revenue stream.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

An aerial work platform, also known as an aerial device, elevating work platform (EWP), or mobile elevating work platform (MEWP) is a mechanical device used to provide temporary access for people or equipment to inaccessible areas, usually at height.\nThe client Haulotte Group is a french company and has recently acquired a U.S. business Bil-Jax Inc. to expand their product offering and also enter the U.S. market. The two major product lines are mobile cranes and tower cranes. The combined company holds approximately 60% of the market. Currently the tower business, used for skyscrapers, is located in Europe. The mobile business, used for building highways, is located in the U.S. Prior to the acquisition, the client company Haulotte Group did have a small mobile manufacturer located in Germany that they still retain.\nThe client has brought you and your consulting team in to determine how to reduce redundancy and maintain a single face to the customer. The client also wants to explore the possibility of expanding mobile cranes business into Europe and tower cranes into the U.S. Should they build new facilities or just ship products?\nAdditional Information: (Provide the following information if requested by interviewee) \n1. Product Flow\n\nManufacturer – Dealer – Construction firm (60% revenues)\nManufacturer – Construction firms (40% revenues)\n\nThe dealer often leases equipment to end customer. Along with that, they are responsible for the repairs to equipment. Their sales force must know the product. The margin they earn is important. The information about merger / acquisition was communicated to dealer so they had an expectation of being able to benefit from redundancy elimination. The dealers will likely expect a lower cost from the manufacturer because of redundancy elimination.\n2. Market Share\n\n\n\n\nEurope\nUS\n\n\nTower\n80%\n20%\n\n\nMobile\n40%\n70%\n\n\nTotal\n60% (globally)\n\n\n\n\nPossible Answer:\n1. Customer Confidence\nAfter the acquisition, managing the dealer relationship is key. The dealers will now have a larger cost of doing business by needing to learn the sales pitch for the new catalog of products. Not to mention the large cost of being prepared to service them. They will need higher margin to offset costs.\n2. Expansion Plans\nThe Mobile Cranes business has 3 options\nA. Expand German facility\n\nDetermine capacity of German facility – no action until it reaches 100% capacity\n\nB. Navigate sites in Europe for possible new facilities\n\nPro: No tariffs\nCons: Finding location that makes sense, Capital Investment\n\nC. Ship to Europe\n\nPro: Spillover excess inventory\nCon: Tariffs, scale to overcome competition (need to worry about competitor retaliation), lead time\n\nThe Tower Cranes business has 2 options\nA. Build new facilities in the U.S.\n\nPro: No tariffs\nCon: Measure customer demand (Does customer demand warrant a new facility?)\n\nB. Ship from Europe\n\nPro: Manage competition if views as insignificant\nCon: Tariffs, scale to overcome competition, lead time\n\nThis was an actual client problem the interviewer worked on. They maxed out production in Germany. In the U.S., they converted a facility to create a hybrid product between mobile and tower cranes that could do small- to mid-sized projects. They didn’t have to invest as much capital as would have been required by a new facility. They gained signification market share. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Aeromar operates scheduled domestic services in Mexico and international services to the USA, South America, and Central America. Its main base is Mexico City International Airport.\nThe Transportes Aeromar airline operates on the Hub & Spoke model (a system of connections arranged like a chariot wheel, in which all traffic moves along spokes connected to the hub at the center). and is currently seeking to increase its revenue. It intends to do so by switching the only airplane currently serving the flight from Mexico City to Brasilia, Brazil (the federal capital city of Brazil with a population of 2 million) to their existing Mexico City-New York City line service. Is this a good idea? Why or why not?\nAdditional Information: (Provide the following information if requested by interviewee.)\n1. Mexico City-Brasilia Route\n\nThe airplane serving the Brazil line is a Boeing B757 with 200 seats\nOnly one airplane serves the Brazil line, making two round trips a day\nThe occupancy rate of the Brazil line is 90%\nEach round trip ticket to Brazil costs $350\n\n2. Mexico City-NYC Route\n\nThe New York line is currently served by 4 planes similar to the Brazil line plane\nThe New York planes each make 3 round trips a day\nThe occupancy rate of the New York line is 80%\nThe round trip ticket cost is the same, $350\nIf an additional plane (and flight) is added to the NYC line, occupancy rate will drop to 70%\n\nPossible Answer:\n1. Areas of Discussion\n\nAre costs relevant for this case? (They are not)\nWhat is the revenue generated by each route?\nIs there enough demand for NYC flights to justify another airplane?\nDoes eliminating the Brazil route have any repercussions on other flights to South America?\n\n2. Analysis (Calculations to be completed by interviewee.)\nCurrent revenue: $798,000 per day\n\nBrazil line = 200 seats * 90% * 2 round trips per day * $350 = $126k / day\nNYC line: 200 seats * 80% * 3 round trips per day * 4 planes * $350 = $672k / day\nTotal revenue from the two lines: $126k + $672k = $798k / day\n\nNew revenue would be: $735,000 per day\n\nNYC line only = 200 seats * 70% * 3 round trips per day * 5 planes * $350 = $735k / day\n\n3. Recommended Conclusion\nThe short answer is “no go”.\nCalculations indicate that eliminating the Brasilia line would actually decrease overall revenues of the airline. This is because the occupancy rates for the New York City route drops when an extra airplane is added to that line.\nIn addition, removing the airplane that serves Brasilia completely eliminates a highly profitable flight, and may cause service quality repercussions due to unsatisfied customers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

It is headquartered in Southbank, Melbourne, Victoria, and until a demerger in May 2011, was the wine division of international brewing company Foster’s Group.\nThe client company Treasury Wine Estates has two types of products: bottled wine and boxed wine. Recently, profits have been decreasing, and the CEO believes that this is due to losses in the boxed wine division. We need to assess the situation and provide a recommendation. Specifically, three questions need to be addressed in this case:\n\nWhat factors should we consider to determine whether the boxed wine is a good business?\nWhat is the profitability of each of the two wine divisions?\nWhat is our recommendation?\n\nAdditional Information: (Provide the following information if requested by interviewee.)\n\nThe client company is currently losing money.\nSales are split evenly between the two divisions.\nBottled wine sells for Australian Dollar (AUD) $6 per unit; Boxed wine sells for AUD$12 per unit.\nBottled wine contains 750ml; Boxed wine contains 3 liters.\nA plastic bag holds the wine inside the box.\nBoth products have an overhead of AUD$0.50 /unit.\nRaw material, consisting of grapes, costs AUD$2 for the bottled wine.\nPackaging costs AUD$1 for both products, while other variables (distribution and labor) are AUD$1 per bottle and AUD$3 per box.\n\nPossible Answer:\n1. Areas of Discussion\n\nHow is revenue split between the two products?\nWhat types of costs do the products carry, and what are they?\nWhat price is being charged for each product? To whom?\nWho is the target customer of each product?\nAre the same grapes being used for both products? Why?\n\n2. Analysis (Calculations to be completed by interviewee.)\n\nIf the grape cost for bottles is AUD$2, then for boxes it is AUD$8 (750 ml:3 liters = 1:4 ratio)\nProfit for bottles is AUD$1.5 (6 – 0.5 – 2 – 1 – 1 = 1.5)\nboxes have a loss of AUD$0.5 (12 – 0.5 – 8 – 1 – 3 = -0.5)\n\n3. Recommended Conclusion\nThe client company should try to source grapes of lower cost for its boxed wine product line.\nAlthough the current raw material cost ratio is 1:4 when comparing bottled wine against boxed wine, the price ratio is only 1:2. We can assume that this is because the bottled line targets a superior market segment, and boxes cater to businesses that sell wine in bulk. This is another reason for not maintaining the same quality (and cost) of grapes for both product lines. If raw material cost for boxed wine could be lowered, even slightly, the line would be profitable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Inc. is an investment management firm specializing in global merger, event arbitrage and credit strategies. The firm mostly works in the arbitrage business, which is quite lucrative. In economics and finance, arbitrage is the practice of taking advantage of a price difference between two or more markets: striking a combination of matching deals that capitalize upon the imbalance, the profit being the difference between the market prices.\nWith its arbitrage strategy, the firm has no profitability problem and no competition. The company has 4 senior analysts, 3 junior analysts, and 1 admin. The activities in which they are involved include the initial stage, which comprises 20% of the work, the core stage which is 70% of the work, and the recommendation which is the remaining 10% of the work. These percentages are constant. How many junior analysts need to be added to free up capacity among the senior analysts, so that they can focus on selling additional work?\nAdditional Information: (Provide the following information if requested by interviewee.)\nThe interviewee should first inquire about how much of the three activities the three staff persons are engaged in.\n\nSenior Analysts do 60% initial, 20% core, and 80% recommendations.\nJunior Analysts do 30% initial, 70% core, and 20% recommendations.\nAdmin does 10% initial and 10% core, with no recommendations.\n\nPossible Answer:\n1. Analysis (Calculations to be completed by interviewee.)\nIf you multiply the percentages that the junior analysts are doing by the breakout of the activities, it looks like this:\n\ninitial stage: 30% of 20% = 6%\ncore stage: 70% of 70% = 49%\nrecommendation: 20% of 10% = 2%\n\nTherefore, 6% + 49% + 2% = 57% of total work is being done by the junior analysts.\n2. Recommended Conclusion\nThere are only 3 junior analysts in the firm. Currently each is doing 57% / 3 or 19% of the total work for the firm.\nHow many junior analysts need to be added so that they are working at 100% capacity?\n100% / 19% = approximately 5.\nThere are currently 3 junior analysts. 5 – 3 = 2 junior analysts need to be added.\nNow that there is a total of five junior analysts, what is the new constraint in getting the work done? -Time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new product.\nConsulting Firm: PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Advisory first round summer internship job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: manufacturing; small business, startups.\nCase Interview Question #00722: You’re a consultant in 17th century Venice, Italy and Powerpoint is your art canvas. You have just been hired by Galileo Galilei (15 February 1564 – 8 January 1642). Galileo was an Italian physicist, mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher who played a major role in the scientific revolution. One of his greatest achievements include improvements to the telescope and consequent astronomical observations and support for Copernicanism.\nThe year is 1609. Your client Galileo Galilei has just invented a new and more powerful telescope, with up to about 30x magnification. He’d like you to help him make some money off what he is sure will be a very useful invention. What do you tell him? How much money would Galileo make from telescope?\nAdditional Information:\nGalileo has a workshop, and 6 talented workers who can manufacture the telescopes for him. Each worker is available 6 days a week, for 8 hours a day, and all-in labor costs are $10 per worker per hour. Raw materials for a telescope come to  $5 per piece, and one worker can make one telescope in 2 hours. This data is only for the costs section of the problem.\nSkills involved in making a telescope consist of grinding the lenses correctly, building the housing and focal length adjustment mechanism, and assembling the parts.\nThe market being considered is the entire world.\nNo data is available on the populations of Italy, Venice, military, traders, frequency of travel, building, warfare etc. The interviewer can respond to all requests for specific information on this stuff with “Why don’t you try and derive an estimate for that?” As long as the assumptions are reasonable, most answers are valid.\nThis is a brainstorming case – the interviewer is looking for creativity in an unusual context. Cases are not dependent on historical facts so any inaccuracies in the candidate’s display of 17th century Europe knowledge is given leeway.\nPossible Answer:\n1. Areas of Discussion\na. Company\nPart of the “Company” bucket includes costs.\n\nWork out costs and production capacity based on the data above.\nCould suggest cost-based pricing\n\nThe candidate would also need to discuss the distribution strategy, which would likely involve selling the goods to local merchants for overseas trading. Also, the company cannot likely produce to keep up with initial demand so the good should be priced accordingly. Should more laborers be hired to increase production?\nb. Customers: Who would need a telescope?\nI. Local\n\nTraders and sailors\nThe military – army/navy\nExplorers – land/sea\nArchitects and surveyors\n\nII. Overseas\n\nSimilar categories\nGeographic categories\n\nEurope is viable\nAsia, Middle East, America, Far East secondary markets\nCould rank in an Effort/Return quadrant matrix (some firms loves their matrices)\n\n\nPolitical considerations\nProfit sharing with traders\nOverseas monopoly\n\nLarge potential demand, relatively slow supply\nHigh likelihood of local imitators\n\n\n\nIII. What do you think is the largest market, at each stage of the product timeline?\n\nExtra Credit: Very rough market-sizing (not the focus of the case)\nCould suggest (very rough) pricing based on willingness-to-pay\n\nc. Competitors\n\nNo patent structure means imitation is a serious problem.\nEase of construction means reverse-engineering is not difficult. Obfuscation of the mechanism may be necessary.\n6 workers are skilled engineers. Each is an intellectual property (IP) risk if they break away and start up on their own – keep them happy and well compensated.\n\n2. Cost Analysis\nThe math is incidental, and not the focus of the case. However, the interviewer may want to test the candidate’s quantitative ability using the example below. The candidate should be able to express why he/she would want to calculate the cost. Reasons can include the desire to assess how many telescopes can be produced relative to an estimated market demand or estimated financial resources required to operate the business.\nInterviewer has already provided the following data:\n\nSix talented workers who can manufacture the telescopes.\nEach worker is available 6 days a week, for 8 hours a day\nAll-in labor costs are $10 per worker per hour.\nRaw materials for a telescope come to $5 per piece\nOne worker can make one telescope in 2 hours\n\nCalculations:\n\nCost per unit telescope = $5 + 2 * $10 = $25\nOne week: 6 works * 8 hour/day * 6 days/week = 288 worker-hours\n# of telescopes manufactured in that time = 288 / 2 = 144 telescopes\nTotal raw materials cost = 144 * $5 = $720\nTotal labor cost = 288 * $10 = $2880\nTotal weekly cost = $3600 for 144 telescopes.\n\n3. Recommended Conclusion\nLarge market exists, both locally and overseas. The market will experience a short initial period of monopoly after which imitators will provide serious competition – preventive strategies are necessary to combat this.\nStructure the response, but be as creative as possible in terms of your ideas. The math is incidental, and not the focus of the case. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

It is headquartered in the GE Building in New York City’s Rockefeller Center, with additional major offices near Los Angeles and in Chicago. NBC has eleven owned-and-operated stations and nearly 200 affiliates in the United States.\nThe year is 2007. Jeff Zucker, the CEO of NBC has asked you for help. In fiscal year 2006, NBC had profits of $3 billion on total revenue of $16.5 billion; these numbers have fallen 10% over the past three quarters. There has also been an $8 million drop in ad revenue due to the proliferation of specialized cable channels as well as changing viewer preferences in media consumption. For this case, NBC’s goals include:\n1. achieving double-digit growth,\n2. reducing costs by $750M, and\n3. spending $150M in digital initiatives in order to grow $400M in revenues (revenues from digital delivery) to $1B.\nHow would you help NBC’s CEO to achieve these three goals?\nAdditional Information: (Provide the following information if requested by interviewee)\n\nProgramming costs for television shows have risen as shows average 60 scenes (vs. 40 scenes previously).\nNBC’s big-budget shows such as Heroes cost $2.5M/episode and charge $200K/spot (there are 20 spots/hour).\nIn addition, on-demand media has cut into revenues although live entertainment is still a draw.\n\nPossible Answer:\nAreas of Discussion\n1. What are your initial thoughts about NBC’s troubles? (ask the candidate immediately, do not allow for questions or any time to gather thoughts)\n2. If a low-budget show like “Deal or No Deal” costs $1M per episode, how much less revenue per spot can NBC afford to charge and still retain the profitability of bigbudget shows?\n3. Given this info, should CEO Jeff Zucker redirect resources towards low-budget shows? What else should he consider?\n4. Brainstorm a bit about how to best use the funds set aside ($150M) for digital initiatives.\nQuestions 1 and 4 are more behavioral and test whether the candidate has thought about digital media and its impact on the entertainment industry. For question 3, the “right” answer is to explore the impact on sources of revenue other than advertising, such as syndication or DVD sales.\nFor question 2: (Calculations to be completed by interviewee.)\n\nBig-budget show’s revenue = $200K/spot * 20 spots/hour = $4M per episode\nBig-budget show’s profit = $4M – $2.5M = $1.5M per episode\n\nTherefore low-budget revenue must be $1M + $1.5M = $2.5M. Assuming there are still 20 spots/hour, NBC can afford to charge $125K/spot for low-budget show.\nFor question 3: keep stonewalling if the interviewee pursues any avenues related to ad revenue. For example, if they say that advertisers will be less attracted to the demographic for shows like “Deal or No Deal”, say “that’s already reflected in the price”. Concede answers involving long-term strategy, competition, etc. but make it clear that those are not satisfactory answers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

It is the most widely circulated newspaper published in Washington, D.C., and was founded in 1877, making it the area’s oldest extant newspaper. Daily editions are printed for the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia.\nAs a major metropolitan newspaper, Washington Post runs advertisements for employers seeking employees (job ads/help wanted ads). Recently, the newspaper has realized that to compete it must offer the ad space on its online version as well. Online, it doesn’t have traditional competitors – its competitors are sites like Linkedin.com, Dice.com, Monster.com and Craigslist.com. It is looking to you to tell it how to manage the migration from print to online. Specifically they would like to know:\n\nHow should they match the pace of the market as more employers go online?\nShould they push employers to spend for online ads?\nHow can it maintain the revenue generated by printed advertising while still pushing for more online revenue?\n\nWhat would you recommend to Washington Post?\nAdditional Information: (Provide the following information if requested by interviewee)\nRevenue from job advertising breaks down into 70 percent revenue from print ads and 30 percent revenue from online ads.\nPrint ads are currently more profitable – $800 profit per print ad versus $400 profit per online job ad.\nOf jobseekers who use this newspaper (and the newspaper’s website) for job seeking, 70 percent currently use print, 30 percent use the website.\nDifferent companies are adopting online advertising at different paces: the early adopters of the website job ads are technology companies and professional service companies. The slower to adapt are government agencies, health care organizations.\nPossible Solution:\nKeep both print and online advertising as package options, especially as print is twice as profitable as online.\nTarget print advertising towards slower adaptors, while also developing a great site to serve clients that only want to go online (can be creative here – what would you do with the site to distinguish it from a site like monster.com?).\nTrain sales force to plug both opportunities, but to understand the client’s needs and build a package that suit’s them best. Once the client is hooked to one option, it will be easier to sell the alternate option.\nUse the print vs. online packages as an opportunity to bundle advertising print and online ads.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: increase profit; new business.\nConsulting Firm: Capital One first round summer internship job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: small business.\nCase Interview Question #00723: You just find out you have a long lost uncle, and he is a fruit cart vendor at a street corner in downtown Manhattan of New York City, NY. He sells his fruit only on weekdays to morning and evening commuters, as well as downtowners going on lunch breaks.\nYour uncle realized that you are a business school MBA student, and he thinks you might be able to make his business more profitable. He wants to increase his profit during this summer by 10%, which would be $1,000 over last year’s profits, and he will plow these profits back into the business.\nIn order to do this, your uncle wants to expand into selling vegetables. He is known for having high-quality fruits, which he gets from his buddy who is a wholesaler. He plans to use similar high-quality suppliers for his vegetables.\nYour uncle operates in a really good location: a well-trafficked spot in the central business district near a busy train station. He wants your help to determine if he can reach his goal of increasing profits by $1,000 next year.\nAdditional Information: (to be provided when requested)\n1. Profitability\nRevenues:\n\nBy talking to customers, your uncle has estimated a potential demand of 20 vegetables/day\nHe expects to sell each vegetable for $1\nCross-selling to certain customers will generate an additional 5% of revenue\n\nCosts:\n\nThe annual cost of his permit to operate is $1,000. These costs will increase by 20%\nCost of each vegetable is 75 cents\nCannibalization will decrease fruit sales by 5%\n\n2. Customers\nYour uncle generally serves three types of customers: morning commuters, evening commuters, and downtowners on lunch breaks.\nHe sees more morning and lunch customers, but evening customers buy for home, so he sells roughly equal proportions of his fruits to each type of customer.\n3. Competition\nThere are no competing vegetable vendors nearby. Fruit customers generally get their vegetables from supermarkets near home.\n4. Competencies\nYour uncle has been in the fruit business for 20 years, and his customers appreciate that he knows the peak seasons for the fruit he sells. He is also a master at picking out the best fruit for his customers. His knowledge in these respects is very limited for vegetables.\nPossible Answer:\n1. Areas of Discussion\nProfitability:\n\nRevenues = volume x price\nCosts = variable costs + fixed costs\n\nCustomers\n\nsimilarities/differences to fruit\nability to cross-sell\n\nCompetition\n\nOther vendors in the area?\nWhere are the customers getting their fruit?\nAre the customers likely to start purchasing their fruit from uncle?\n\nProduct\n\nYour uncle’s product expertise\nWhich vegetables will he offer (veggies for home cooking?)\nWill there be different spoilage rates that make veggies more difficult to keep on hand?\n\nOther considerations\n\nCannibalization\nCross-selling\n\nResources\n\nWhere will uncle get the financing to expand?\nIs there space in his cart to expand?\n\n2. Analysis (Calculations to be completed by interviewee.)\n\nProfit on each veggie: $1 – 0.75 = 0.25 per veggie\nProfit on veggies each day = 0.25 x 20 units = $5\nTotal Profit on Veggie Sales = $5/day x 5 days/week x 52 weeks/year = $1,300\nAnnual profit (current) on fruit if $1,000 increase is 10% = $10,000 annual profit\nNew fruit profit (from cross-selling) = 5% x $10,000 = $500\nLost profit from cannibalization = 5% x $10,000 = $500\nIncreased cost of permit = 20% x $1,000 = $200\nTotal new profit = $1,300 + $500 – $500 – $200 = $1,100\n\n3. Recommended Conclusion\nAt current estimated demand levels, your uncle would be able to surpass his projected profit target of $1,000 by $100 next year. He may want to do informal surveys of his customers to determine which vegetables would be more preferable, which could increase daily demand.\nRisks to consider\n\nSince he will just make his target by $100, he must be confident that his lack of expertise with vegetables will not affect his relationships with his customers.\nHe must also be aware that his lack of expertise may lead to spoilage rates that could eat into his profits to a degree that he did not anticipate.\nIt is also important that he is comfortable that he can find the additional cash (at least $300 to finance the expansion into the new product).\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: math problem; operations strategy, optimization.\nConsulting Firm: Kurt Salmon first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: sports, leisure, recreation.\nCase Interview Question #00717: Aspen Mountain is a ski area located in Pitkin County, Colorado, just outside and above the city of Aspen. It is situated on the north flank of Aspen Mountain and the higher Bell Mountain at an elevation of 11,212 ft (3418 m) just to the south of Aspen Mountain. It was founded in 1946 as the first ski area venture of the Aspen Skiing Company, and today it is one of four adjacent ski areas operated by the company as part of the Aspen/Snowmass complex.\nThe Aspen Mountain ski field, with only one ski lift and one slope, has a limit of 200 skiers and is full every day. The ski lift has a capacity of 5 skiers per minute and it takes 10 minutes for the lift to carry a skier to the top of the mountain slope. Skiers take 5 minutes on average to ski down and get in the queue again.\nThe manager of Aspen Mountain ski field has hired you to analyze how the time that skiers spend in the queue can be reduced. There are two options: (A) increase the speed of the ski lift or (B) build another equal lift. There are no budget constraints in the decision. Which of the two options would you recommend the manager pursues?\nPossible Answer:\nThe recommended approach to this problem is as follows:\n1. Find the time skiers spend in the line (25 minutes, see below)\n2. Analyze the first option: increase the speed of the ski lift, e.g. 5 minutes. That would actually increase the queue time to 30 minutes (see below)\n3. Analyze the second option: build another ski lift, that would decrease the queue time to 5 minutes (see below)\n4. The mountain can hold the double of skiers if another lift is built (told only if asked)\nThere are two methods one might take to calculate the queue time\nMethod 1:\nSki lift capacity * (Minutes in queue + Minutes on lift + Minutes skiing) = number of skiers / number of lifts\n5 skiers per minute * (X + 10 + 5) mins = 200 / 1\n\n\n\n\nBefore the change\nOption A: increase lifting speed\nOption B: add a second lift\n\n\n# skiers\n200 people\n200 people\n200 people\n\n\nski lift capacity\n5 skiers/min\n5 skiers/min\n5 skiers/min\n\n\n# lifts\n1\n1\n2\n\n\nmins lifting\n10 mins\n5 mins\n10 mins\n\n\nmins skiing\n5 mins\n5 mins\n5 mins\n\n\nmins queuing\n25 mins\n30 mins\n5 mins\n\n\n\nMethod 2:\n\n\n\n\nBefore the change\nOption A: increase lifting speed\nOption B: add a second lift\n\n\nski lift capacity\n5 people/min\n5 people/min\n5 people/min\n\n\nmins lifting\n10 mins\n5 mins\n10 mins\n\n\nmins skiing\n5 mins\n5 mins\n5 mins\n\n\n# skiers\n200 people\n200 people\n200 people\n\n\n# skiers on lift\n5 skiers/min * 10 mins = 50\n5 skiers/min * 5 mins = 25\n5 skiers/min * 10 mins * 2 lifts = 100\n\n\n# skiers skiing\n5 skiers/min * 5 mins = 25\n5 skiers/min * 5 mins = 25\n5 skiers/min * 5 mins * 2 lifts = 50\n\n\n# skiers queuing\n5 skiers/min * X mins = 125\n5 skiers/min * X mins = 150\n5 skiers/min * X mins * 2 lifts = 50\n\n\nTotal\n200\n200\n200\n\n\nqueuing time\n25 mins\n30 mins\n5 mins\n\n\n\nThe interviewee can use another hypothesis for lift time reduction in option A; but the conclusion must be the same.\nConclusion:\nBuilding a new ski lift is a better option for queue time reduction.\nIf there is time, the interviewer could ask the interviewee to brainstorm additional measures the manager might take to reduce queue time, e.g. build a cafeteria, lengthen the run, increase ticket’s price, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: increase sales/revenues; growth.\nConsulting Firm: A.T. Kearney first round summer internship job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: apparel, clothing, textiles.\nCase Interview Question #00716: Our client St. John Knits International Inc. is a family owned and operated apparel manufacturer. It has been in business for over 50 years and manufactures branded men’s and women’s knit clothing. Headquartered in Irvine, California, the company is best known  for its classic styling and extensive use of primary colors. The knit clothing market is typically highly fragmented. All production occurs overseas although St. John sells primarily to U.S. based retailers.\nSt. John’s management has approached us with the following issue. It is year 2006 now and they want to sell the business by 2008. They want to maximize the asking price by doubling the company’s EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) over the next two years. Our job is to determine if that goal is feasible.\nTo get started, the senior management team has offered to give us 20 minutes of their time to answer any pertinent questions before we begin. Please take a moment to determine what information you would need from your client to begin your analysis. How would you go about this case?\nAdditional Information: Provide the following information if requested \nBranded Clothing means St. John is hired to manufacture clothing for specialty retailers such as Fruit of the Loom, Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic, etc.\nKnit clothing includes all tops and bottoms made of raw materials consisting of cotton, fleece or a synthetic cotton blend, it does not include sweaters. (i.e. t-shirts, sweatpants, underwear etc)\nThe Apparel market being highly fragmented is from a manufacturer’s perspective. There is no one manufacturer capturing more than 5% market share.\nPossible Answer:\nThere are several correct answers here. One possibility is using the 3C’s as an initial framework with the following pieces of information.\n\nCompany: What is the client company’s existing profit margin and how does it compare to industry averages?\nCustomers: Who are its core customers: large retailers, small retailers, Big Box discount retailers or specialty retailers? How many customers – is the majority of capacity filled by one client?\nCompetitors: Who are the core competitors?\n\nThe interviewer should pick 2-3 pieces of information that the interviewee mentions and ask for an explanation as to why he/she raises those points and why they are important.\nAn alternative challenge could be to ask the interviewee to rank the top 3 pieces of information necessary and give a brief explanation as to why. A possible response given the above info could be:\n\nProfit Margins for both the company and the industry are important to understand if there are any organic opportunities for the company to grow EBIT by improving existing operations (i.e. if the company has a 5% profit margin and the industry average is 8% – there might be cost cutting or economies of scale to be leveraged to gain an additional 3% in profit with minimal change).\nIt is important to know what types of customers St. John serves to understand the bargaining power it could be up against. Put another way, if St. John manufacturers clothing for Wal-Mart, it could face pressure from the retailer to lower prices in order to maintain its business. Or, if 40% of St. John’s quarterly capacity is occupied by Abercrombie – St. John could face issues with economies of scale and maintain cost levels if Abercrombie were to not fill its orders. This could lead to eroding profit margins.\nComparable sales growth rates for both St. John and the overall industry will show if the business is growing at the same rate as the market.\n\nPart #2: After the candidate has successfully navigated through Part #1, the interviewer should give the following information.\nThe Senior Management team at St. John has given us the following metrics that represent the average for the total Knit Apparel Manufacturing Industry:\n1. Retailers\n\n2005 Unit Sales were 35 million units.\nUnit sales grew 6% from 2004 to 2005.\nAverage Unit Retail is $120.\nRetailers make a 50% gross margin per unit.\n\n2. Manufacturers\n\nCost of goods sold per unit is $33\nSG&A (Selling, General and Administrative Expenses) per unit is $12\n\nPossible Answer:\nThe interviewer should prompt the interviewee to take a moment to examine the data to see what possible conclusions he/she can draw. Calculations are necessary. The interviewee should use the retail 50% GM and costs per unit to arrive at a profit margin for the manufacturers.\nThe interviewee should have some knowledge of the income statement to determine the following:\n\nSales – COGS = Gross Margin\nGross Margin – SG&A Expense = EBIT Margin*\n\n*The EBIT margin should be a main focus because the firm in question wants to double this measure. Therefore from St. John’s perspective each unit sale would look like this:\n\nRevenue $60 = $120 x 50%\nCOGS ($33) Given\nGross Margin $27 = $60 – $33\nGross Margin 45% = $27/$60\nSG&A ($12) Given\nEBIT $15 = GM – SG&A expense = $27 – $12\nEBIT 25% = $15/$60\n\nConclusion 1: The interviewee should get to an EBIT margin percentage (25%) and then want to know more about St. John’s profit margin numbers to draw a comparison to the industry average.\nConclusion 2: The interviewee should note that the retail growth percentage is 6% and make the connection that if the overall industry is growing at 6% – St. John’s business should also be growing at 6%.\nHaving arrived at both of these conclusions the interviewee should want to know more about the performance metrics of St. John specifically.\nThe interviewee may use these numbers to calculate numerous other figures such as retail dollars (units x average unit retail) or 2004 unit or retail dollar sales using the growth percentage. This is a good demonstration of quantitative ability and knowledge of how the metrics fit together – although these are not necessary to solve the case. If the interviewer would like to check the interviewee’s accuracy, here are answers to the above mentioned calculations:\n\n2005 Retail dollars = 35 million units * $120 per unit = $4.2 Billion\n\nThe below assumes that 6% is true for both dollar and unit sales and that average unit retail does not change between 2004 & 2005.\n\n2004 Retail dollars = $4.2 billion / (1 + 6%) =~ $3.96 Billion\n2004 Unit Sales = 35 million / (1 + 6%) =~ 33.0 million\n\nPart #3: Once the interviewee has thoroughly examined the data set and has arrived at the above two conclusions provide him/her with the following second set of numbers:\nNow that we have an idea as to the performance levels of the overall industry, here are some metrics that may help you:\nActual results for St. John:\n\n\n\n\n2005\n2004\n\n\nRevenue\n$600m\n$565m\n\n\nCOGS\n$330m\n$310m\n\n\nSG&A\n$120m\n$113m\n\n\n\nWhat does this tell you?\nPossible Answer:\nThe interviewee should perform the following calculations with this data set:\n\nRevenue growth % from 2004 to 2005 (and compare to industry)\nGross margins and EBIT margins for both years (compare to industry)\nSt. John’s market share of total manufacturing industry\n\n\n\n\n\n2005\n2004\nGrowth\n\n\nRevenue\n$600m\n$565m\n~6% (6.19%)\n\n\nCOGS\n$330m\n$310m\n\n\n\nGross Margin $\n$270m\n$255m\n~6% (6.45%)\n\n\nGross Margin %\n45%\n45%\nFlat growth\n\n\nSG&A\n$120m\n$113m\n\n\n\nEBIT\n$150m\n$142m\n~6% (6.19%)\n\n\nEBIT%\n25%\n25%\nFlat growth\n\n\n\nMarket Share = 600m / 2,100m =~ 30% (actual 28.6%) (note: 2,100m comes from first data set. If total 2005 retail dollars are $4.2 billion and they earn a 50% margin, that means that the total revenue for the manufacturers would be half of that amount = $4,200 * 50% = $2.1 billion ($2,100 million)\nThe interviewee should recognize that this company is growing equal to or slightly above the industry and profit margins are aligned, therefore organic growth is not possible and the feasibility of doubling EBIT in two years is looking unattainable. Additionally, the interviewee should speak about St. John’s current market share of 29% and briefly indicate what this could mean for the client.\nPart #4: Now that we have determined that organic growth is not possible and because this company appears to be totally aligned with the industry in terms of EBIT margins and revenue growth what are some other opportunities for growth?\nPossible Answer:\nPossible suggestions: (a great answer would not only incorporate several ideas but also factor in the feasibility of achieving them within the two year time frame)\n\nAcquire smaller competitors in this ‘highly fragmented market’\nExtend manufacturing into additional product categories either organically or through acquisitions\nDetermine if facilities are running at 100% capacity and potential acquire new customers\n\nPart #5: Senior Management of St. John has collected this data on possible product extensions to drive growth. The following data is representative of the entire market within these categories.\n\n\n\n\nKids & Baby Knits\nKnit Accessories\nSweaters\n\n\n2005 Sales\n30M\n80M\n20M\n\n\nAverage Unit Retail\n$100\n$60\n$120\n\n\nRetail Revenue\n$3,000M\n$4,800M\n$2,400M\n\n\nAverage Retail Gross Margin\n50%\n45%\n55%\n\n\nManufacturing Revenue\n$1,500M\n$2,640M\n$1,080M\n\n\nAverage Manufacturing Price\n$50\n$33\n$54\n\n\nAverage COGS / Unit\n$18\n$10\n$25\n\n\nAverage SG&A / Unit\n$8\n$5\n$10\n\n\nAverage Operating Income\n$24\n$18\n$19\n\n\nAverage Manufacturing Gross Margin\n48%\n55%\n35%\n\n\nManufacturing EBIT\n$720M\n$1,440M\n$380M\n\n\n’04 – ’05 growth rate\n4%\n5%\n6%\n\n\n\nDescription of Product Categories:\n1. Kids & Baby Knits = similar products to current production although for a different customer\n2. Knit Accessories = scarves, belts, wraps, purses, hair accessories (all made from cotton or cotton blends)\n3. Sweaters = All sweaters for men and women\nPossible Answer:\nThe interviewee should be most concerned with the EBIT and growth rate of each potential product extension. He or she should recognize that current EBIT is $150 million therefore; each of these segments is attractive because it could give St. John the potential for rapid growth (assuming they are able to successfully capture a significant portion of market share). The interviewee should also draw conclusions about how fast each of these markets is growing and potential market share necessary to capture.\nWhat will separate an average interviewee from a great one will be their ability to further probe into these businesses and from a high level ask questions about synergies between the product lines. The interviewee should want to know more about capacity restraints, raw material procurement, and operational restrictions. For example: sweaters production would require different machinery than what is already owned by the factory – would the expected profits warrant the expense for equipment and training of employees?\nPart #6: Conclusion\nOnce the interviewee has had some time to understand the data and draw conclusions – ask them to give an elevator pitch covering a summery of their findings, what their immediate conclusions are and what pieces of information have lead them to their answer.\nPossible Answer:\nAnswers will vary among interviewees. One possible summary would be as follows:\nAfter conducting interviews and analyzing both industry and company data, I would explain to our client that doubling EBIT over the next two years will be challenging and most likely will not happen without the acquisition of a smaller player. We did an assessment to identify organic growth opportunities but because St. John’s growth and EBIT margins are in line with the industry as a whole there is no leverage there. Additionally, we looked at total market share of which St. John controls ~30% showing little room for growth. The only feasible option would be to acquire targets to incur rapid growth both in size and profitability. (No such data was available for review, but this is where I would look next.)\nFinally, 3 product line extensions were researched and reviewed. While accessories are a high volume, high profit business, there could be potential manufacturing constraints and substantial capital expenditure that would limit upside realized in a two year period. Also, this particular market is seeing only 5% growth which is slightly less than its core business. Sweaters would be passed up for the low margins and capacity restraints. The kids and baby business would be the only feasible option because it would be possible to expand into this market using available resources. The only potential risk would be how fast the business is able to realize the upside potential and how easy it is to procure additional raw materials and build customer relationships. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: improve profitability.\nConsulting Firm: Deloitte Consulting first round summer internship job interview.\nIndustry Coverage:  household goods, consumer products.\nCase Interview Question #00718: Your client today is The Scotts Miracle Gro Company (NYSE: SMG), an American multinational company headquartered in Marysville, Ohio. They are a consumer packaged goods (CPG) company that manufactures lawn and garden consumable products such as lawn and plant fertilizers, grass seeds, and weed and insect control products. This accounts for a majority of the business and is $1.9 Billion of their $2.7 Billion annual sales. They also have other divisions in the outdoor living category such as professional lawn services and retail stores with outdoor furniture, garden tools, and accessories, which earns the remaining $0.8 Billion revenue.\nRecently, The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company has seen their profitability in the CPG business decline and has approached your consulting firm to find out why and recommend a solution. How would you go about analyzing this case?\nPossible Answer:\n1. Industry Landscape\n\nThis product category is mature with growth of 4% per year. (This is important to understand the source of declining profitability.)\nThe client The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company is the market leader, with about 61% market share on average across their categories.\nThe other two big players in the market are Spectrum Brands, Inc. and Central Garden & Pet Company.\nSome additional smaller players exist.\n\n2. Competition 1: Spectrum Brands, Inc.\n\nAnnual Sales: $800 MM\nMarket Share: (Candidate can calculate this) ~26%\nProducts: The majority of their business is in producing private label or exclusive lines for Home Depot, Lowe’s and Wal-Mart. They are a lower-cost producer of value products.\n\n3. Competition 2: Central Garden & Pet Company\n\nAnnual Sales: $500 MM\nMarket Share: (Candidate can calculate this) ~16%\nProducts: Strong in grass seed segment.\nRegion: Primarily in the South.\n\n4. Retail Distribution Channels\n\n75% of CPG sales are through Home Depot, Wal-Mart, and Lowe’s.\nRemaining 25% of sales are through what are called independent stores: hardware stores, nursery centers, regional chain mass merchant stores, and grocery and drug stores.\nDo you have any information about product sales or trends at Home Depot? While retail sales continue to be up slightly at Home Depot, wholesale sales have been flat to declining because they had built up excessive inventory and are now unloading that before purchasing more. This is expected to continue in 2008.\nDo you have any information about product sales or trends at Lowe’s? Sales are increasing quickly at Lowe’s, mostly following their store expansion and also due to more of the client’s products being sold there.\nDo you have any information about product sales or trends at Wal-Mart? Sales at Wal-Mart are growing, but slower than the growth we estimate for the overall market.\nDo you have any information about product sales or trends at Independent Retailers? Sales at independents are growing, slightly, even though these outlets are losing market share to Home Depot, Lowe’s, and Wal-Mart overall. This growth is due to the optimization of the go-to-market approach (selling direct to bigger accounts and going to distributor in others, with a pay-for-performance incentive for distributors).\n\n5. Product Customer\n\nConsumers who buy the client’s products are traditionally male, but increasingly female or the purchases are influenced by females.\nThey are predominantly home owners.\n\n6. Client: The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company\nAnnual Sales: $1.9 Billion\nMarket Share: 61%\nRevenue: Has been increasing over the past few years.\nPrice: Increased for the first time in a few years on the premium product segment.\nVolume: Total product sales have increased.\nCosts:\n\nVariable Costs: Have increased due to increases in raw material costs and freight. The client has been able to pass these along to the Premium product.\nFixed Costs: Have stayed constant.\n\nDistribution Regions: Stronger in the Northeast and Midwest because their core products align with the climate and growing conditions in this region. The client has been expanding product line to offer products suited specifically for other regions as well.\nAdvertising: Advertises significantly to educate consumers on the importance of the product category.\nBenefits due to scale: Bargaining power with retailers to influence on display and promotion space. Savings due to efficiencies in supply chain.\nProducts: The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company has two main segments.\n\nPremium Products: This has been their core business for a while. The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company is known as a high quality producer and leads the industry in innovation.\nPrivate Label Products: The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company recently launched a number of new private label or exclusive products at the request of retailers. (If asked what a Private Label is, it is a store branded product.)\n\nHas the Private Label product cannibalized the Premium product?\n\nNo, it hasn’t.\n\nHow has volume grown for the individual product lines?\n\nThe Private Label product has grown volume. Premium brand has stayed constant and has not been cannibalized by Private Label.\n\nWhy sell Private Label brands? (The Interviewer should present the information below one bullet at a time; at that point the interviewee should challenge that and ask for further rationalization which would prompt the interviewer to reveal the next reason)\n\nThe Scotts Miracle-Gro Company makes private label brands because the retailers have requested it, in order to differentiate themselves from their competitors and reduce pricing pressure.\nThe Scotts Miracle-Gro Company wants to take existing business from competitors such as Central Garden & Pet Company, and also prevent them from gaining new business in the industry.\nThe Scotts Miracle-Gro Company hopes to use these products to negotiate other benefits such as additional control of the inventory process (with advance orders and better forecasting, the client can reduce costs for themselves as well as the retailers. However, retailers are often reluctant to turn this over).\n\nDo the Private Label and Premium Brand products share the same cost structure/manufacturing processes?\n\nNo. The Private Label is sourced to a third party who is able to produce the products at a much lower costs than the client. This affects costs for the Premium brand product because the client frees up more excess capacity and is unable to utilize supply chain efficiencies and scale economies.\n\nAre margins the same across both product segments?\n\nNo. The Private Label products earn a lower margin than the premium products because The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company has to give their clients, the retailers, a greater portion of the margin.\n\nHow are product sales teams structured? How are they incentivized?\n\nProduct sales teams are divided into client-specific business development teams, and are incentivized on meeting aggressive top line growth targets (which are set significantly above the product category market growth rate). Sales of the Private Label products help the sales teams achieve these targets.\n\n7. Case Takeaways\nQuestion #1: What is the source of declining profitability?\nTop-line has been increased, while the overall product margin has decreased over the years. This is the root cause of the decline in profitability.\nQuestion #2: What can you say about the client’s decision to enter the Private Label product market?\nWhen the benefits are quantified and considered against costs, the client is giving up more than they are gaining. This has been happening because they have been introducing these lower margin private label or exclusive lines, with little real justification.\n8. Recommended Conclusion\nPotential solutions to declining profitability:\n\nChange incentives for product sales teams to be weighted in terms of product margin.\nRequire more rigorous study of the economics of private label/exclusive brand plays before making the commitment to the customer—all “strategic” benefits should be quantified.\nThere is an inevitable tradeoff between revenue growth and margin. Identify which is more important, top-line growth for Wall Street or the ultimate bottom-line? Potentially abandon private label business to restore margins.\n\n9. Bonus Question (for the star candidate who completes the case on time): The client Scotts Miracle-Gro Company is a publicly traded company that has promised top-line growth in the near term to its Wall Street investors. How can the company achieve this?\nRecommendations for Bonus Question:\nThe client can increase top-line Revenue by:\n\nThe client can leverage its strength in R&D to innovate in new areas such as effective and budget-friendly organics.\nThe client can gain top line growth by encouraging more frequent usage of products.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new business; market sizing.\nConsulting Firm: Accenture first round summer internship job job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: Transportation.\nCase Interview Question #00701: Your consulting firm’s new client Uber is a venture-funded startup and transportation network company that connects passengers with drivers of vehicles for hire and ride-sharing services. Uber is based in San Francisco, California and rapidly expanding in the U.S. and internationally, offering service in over 35 cities worldwide.\nUber’s founder and chairman, serial entrepreneur Garrett Camp has come to you with a new business idea. Mr. Camp wants to start a helicopter flight service between midtown Manhattan and John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK). How would you begin to evaluate this opportunity and what are the basic economics behind it? He has asked you to brief him on your conclusion in a 1-minute elevator ride from the 50th floor to the ground floor. What would you tell him?\nPossible Answer:\nThis “new business” case requires a cost/benefit analysis as well as an estimate for market size. Because the interviewer explicitly asked for the “economics,” you know you will have to do some basic number crunching. While coming up with  an analysis, the candidate should also make sure to include alternatives as to what else the client could do with the helicopter. One possible approach would begin by asking why the client Uber wants this new route, in order to try and keep in mind the company’s objectives.\nCandidate: Does the client Uber’s helicopter service idea have anything to do with the company’s current business activities?\nInterviewer: Yes, the client has a fleet of helicopters it purchased during the dot-com boom days and has excess capacity.\nCandidate: So the fixed costs for purchasing the helicopters are already sunk. Can you tell me the costs involved with the up keep of one helicopter?\nInterviewer: What would you expect the costs involved to be?\nCandidate: I would assume some of the costs that go along with owning a helicopter include:\n\nPilot salary/benefits\nMaintenance\nGas\nInsurance\nTaxes\n\nInterviewer: That’s a good list. Let’s just say that these all cost about $20,000 per helicopter per month.\nCandidate: How many helicopters does the client have?\nInterviewer: They recently sold off most of the fleet, but retained two helicopters for company use. (Note to candidate: At this point you have determined the cost portion, you should now move on to the revenue stream.)\nCandidate: The people who would most value the time saving and convenience of this offer would be top corporate executives on business trip. The economics are similar to a limo service. In order to determine the revenue, I will need to know how much to charge per person and the number of people who would use this service. For the latter, I can estimate this based on the total possible capacity.\nTo begin, I’ll assume the service is used mainly during rush hours when convenience is most greatly valued. This includes four hours in the early morning and four hours in the evening, or eight “rush hours” worth of flights a day. Assuming a helicopter can land every 15 minutes, there would be 32 flights per helicopter with potential passengers to pick up (four 15-minute intervals in each hour * eight relevant hours = 32).\nAssuming 10 passengers per flight and a 10% usage rate, I would expect each flight to carry about one person (10*0.1=1), which equals 32 passengers per helicopter per day. I would also assume that the service is not used through out the week, but only early on and late in the week.\nLet’s say it’s most needed about 16 hours per week. This gives me a weekly customer potential per helicopter of 64 customers and a monthly potential of 256 passengers per helicopter (64*4=256). For ease of calculations, I’ll round this to about 250 people per month per helicopter.\nNow that I have a number for customers, I’ll need to figure out how much to charge them. At the very least, the price should cover the $25,000 monthly costs per helicopter. As an initial price, let’s assume we charged $100 per person. This would yield $100*250 = $25,000 in revenue per helicopter. For a month, this would give us a profit of $5,000 per helicopter ($25,500-$20,000 = $5,000). For two helicopters, that’s $10,000 in total profit per month.\nInterviewer: Good, so what other issues are involved?\nCandidate: Well, I would like to know the alternatives to running this service, such as selling the helicopters. To see whether it’s a good investment, I would find out the life of the helicopters as well as their saleable value, and see if the discounted cash flows during the life of the helicopters exceeds what I could get by selling them today.\nInterviewer: That’s a good way to consider the investment. Assume it makes sense to run the service. What else should you consider?\nCandidate: I would want to know what additional sources of revenue the helicopter could generate when it’s not being used. For instance, the client can rent it out for private use, especially in the summer when the wealthy are looking to be out in the Hamptons or other vacation homes in the area. In addition, the client could work with the city to set up an emergency helicopter service for hospitals during off hours.\nInterviewer: That’s a good idea. So what would you recommend to the client?\nCandidate: At initial glance, this helicopter service seems to be a good business idea. Given initial assumptions that will need to be validated, annual profits could be $120,000. There may also be other revenue streams to consider since there will be excess capacity during off airport transport hours. However, there are other issues that will need to be tested to see if they will affect the cost structure such as legal and regulatory issues. My suggestion for next steps would be to validate all economic assumptions and to look into legal rules and restrictions.\nInterviewer: Very good! Thank you.\nComments:\nRemember that it’s okay to make certain assumptions but always do a sanity check at the end. The interviewer will look for that. Also, you don’t have to do complicated calculations. No one expects you to cover all issues in the economic model, as long as you have brought up the pertinent issues. Lastly, remember to “think out loud”.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new product; operations strategy.\nConsulting Firm: IMS Health Consulting Group second round summer internship job job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: healthcare: pharmaceutical, biotech, life sciences.\nCase Interview Question #00700: The client Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd is the largest pharmaceutical company in Japan and Asia and one of the top 15 pharmaceutical companies in the world. The company has over 30,000 employees worldwide and achieved $16.2 billion USD in revenue during the 2012 fiscal year. Takeda Pharmaceutical is focused on metabolic disorders, gastroenterology, neurology, inflammation, as well as oncology.\nTakeda Pharmaceutical has come to your consulting firm for advice on a new drug product launch that would treat a degenerative disease. A degenerative disease is a disease in which the function or structure of the affected tissues or organs will increasingly deteriorate over time, whether due to normal bodily wear or lifestyle choices such as exercise or eating habits.\nWhat factors should Takeda Pharmaceuticals consider in terms of timing the launch of a new drug product that just received FDA approval?\nPossible Answer:\nThis is a qualitative strategy case with a nice twist at the end. The interviewee has to think outside the box to get to the solution. There is room for the interviewee to draw the pharmaceutical value chain during this case (added bonus).\nI. Suggested Approach/Framework\nThe interviewee should think about the following areas within his or her framework.\n\nThe Launch and Market Share Objectives of the client company\nThe Competitive Landscape\nThe Financial Implications\n\n1. Objective of new product launch\na. Gain market share, slipping market share due to undifferentiated products.\nb. Loyal patients have been moving to the competitor’s product; hence, we need to regain lost patients. The new launch is for a drug delivery device.\nc. The launch should also gain patients from the competition in order to build market share.\nd. Improve corporate image.\n2. Competitive Landscape\na. It is a $1B market, the client has 10% market share.\nb. A key competitor is going to launch their new device in a matter of weeks. There is unrest on further market share erosion and loss of current patients.\nc. There are four major competitors in the market; one with 60% share (the company with an upcoming launch) and the rest almost equally divided amongst the other three (which includes our client Takeda).\n3. Financial Implications and Objectives\na. The goal is to double revenue within one fiscal year.\nb. We are two months into the year and can potentially launch next month, but that will be a few weeks after the competition has launched anyway.\nc. The launch budget is $7 Million, 1/5 the competition’s budget for launch.\nd. The value each patient offers is $150,000 annually for adults and $60,000 annually with pediatrics.\n4. Other Factors\na. The positioning of the competitor’s product is along safety. Market research has indicated that this resonates most with pediatrics.\nb. We have 22 sales representatives in the field.\nc. The rest of the competition has no launch plans.\nII. Analysis\n1. How many patients does Takeda need?\nClient company makes 10% of a $1B market which is $100M and needs to make another $10M within one year.\n\nThis translates into about 67 adult patients ($100M / $150K = 667) within the fiscal year.\nThe result is approximately 30 patients per sales representative within the year (667 / 22 = 30) – to even out the distribution you can average one patient in the weaker territories and 30 – 50 patients in the dense territories. (Please make a note that in defining what is weak/dense the upside potential of a territory should be identified, not just the hold of our client in that territory).\n\n2. Focused targeting\n\nPhysicians/Clinics – Target physicians who are more concerned with patient quality of life and ease of use (use publications and sales force input).\nDistribution centers – Target distribution centers that are not in long-term contracts with the key competition and gain their loyalty.\nPatient Type – Focus on young adults with a high volume upside and more inclination towards quality of life vs. safety (assuming all products meet safety standards by FDA guidelines).\n\n3. Broadening reach to gain critical mass\n\nLarge upside geographic centers – Research the location of clinics and consumers that have a large uptake, but a more fragmented dipping into all products – aim at gaining their loyalties.\nMid-size distribution centers – Since large distribution centers are in “grandfathered” contracts with the competition, target the mid-size centers that have been ignored and cater to their population. Try to lock annual high volume contracts.\nPatient Advocacy groups\n\nIII. Recommended Conclusion\nTimeline – the new product launch should indeed be delayed as the client Takeda is still in the first quarter and this gives them time to sharpen their strategy with us and leverage the following:\n\nIdentify weaknesses from the competition’s launch.\nAllow the competition to preempt key customers and then target the unmet market.\nWait until the competition has set their brand strategy and use the time to target a differentiated brand strategy.\nPositioning and alignment with key customers especially while negotiating contracts with distributors and clinics (the competitor contracts would be public knowledge at this stage).\n\nThere is benefit to being second-to-market, as long as a strategic plan is incorporated, inclusive of various scenarios. However, there should not be a delay over three months as this might compromise the launch uptake and time needed to gain critical mass.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new product.\nConsulting Firm: Hitachi Consulting first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: aerospace; startups.\nCase Interview Question #00699: We have been approached by the co-founder and CEO of a start-up company called Eclipse Aerospace Corporation. Based in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the company has developed a small very light jet (VLJ). Eclipse Aerospace’s CEO needs our assistance in formulating a strategy to take its product to market.\nTo date the start-up company has spent $500 million in developing a prototype of the VLJ jet it calls the Eclipse 500. The Eclipse 500 seats six people and comes appointed with leather seats and the safety features of a Boeing or Airbus jetliner. However it has little legroom for passengers and no bathroom. It is simple enough to be flown by only one pilot and travels at over 430 miles an hour – which is much faster than other light aircraft that carry a similar number of passengers.\nThe U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) says it’s on track to complete the certification of the Eclipse 500 jet within the next two months. The CEO of Eclipse Aerospace has asked us for advice on a strategy to take the Eclipse 500 to market. We are meeting with the CEO in twenty minutes. What issues would you want to explore with him initially?\nAdditional Information: Provide the following information if requested\n1. Price \nEclipse Aerospace plans to sell the Eclipse 500 for $1.5M each.\n2. Costs\n\nRent per annum: $5M\nFinancing costs per annum: $14M\nPlant & equipment per annum: $25M\nSalaries of full time permanent employees: $1M\nVariable labor cost per jet: $100,000\nMaterials cost per jet: $1M\nFixed overhead per annum: $5M\nVariable overhead per jet: $300,000\n\n3. Competition\n\nBig players like Boeing and Airbus do not produce a small jet similar to the Eclipse 500 and there are no indications that they intend doing so.\nGulfstream, Cessna, Bombardier and Dassault all make corporate jets, although none of them presently manufacture a jet of the size and performance of the Eclipse 500.\nEclipse Aerospace understands that three companies may be developing a very light jet (VLJ), namely Cessna, Honda and a start up Canadian company.\n\nPossible Answer:\nThe interviewer is looking for the interviewee to construct a logical and coherent framework to analyze this new product and its prospects. Many answers will be appropriate. This is an opportunity to drill down into an interviewee’s answers and get them to explain their reasoning and why issues are important.\nOne approach is to use the 4P’s of Price, Promotion, Product and Place to set out issues to be discussed with the CEO.\nAlso very relevant is the customer segment the company is targeting (which will lead onto the second question).\nFinally, the interviewee may want to explore the relevant supply chain and how the company intends extracting value from it.\nQuestion #2: The CEO of Eclipse Aerospace has indicated an interest in two potential markets in particular: the corporate jet market and the Air Taxi market. The latter market is made up of operators who intend using the Eclipse 500 to ferry passengers between cities currently under-served by the big airlines.\nEclipse Aerospace does not have the resources to position itself in both markets. The CEO is convinced it must choose one.\nThe corporate jet market is well-established with big players such as Gulfstream, Cessna, Bombardier and Dassault dominating. This year the market for small to mid-size jets is estimated at $4 billion. Eclipse Aerospace believes it could be a niche player and secure three quarters of one percent of that market.\nThe Air Taxi market is very much in its infancy and harder to estimate. Present estimates indicate sales will be in the range of $200 million to $600 million. If we take the midpoint of this range, what market share would Eclipse Aerospace need to secure to generate the same sales as the corporate market?\nPossible Answer:\nEstimated sales in corporate market = 0.75% x $4 billion = $30 million\nMidpoint of Air Taxi market = $400 million\nMarket share required in Air Taxi market = $30 / $400 = 7.5%\nQuestion #3: Aside from just potential revenues what issues should Eclipse Aerospace take into account when choosing between the Air Taxi and the Corporate markets?\nPossible Answer:\nThe interviewee can discuss numerous considerations here. The interviewer should engage the interviewee in discussion and probe the answers given by him/her. Ask why, dig deeper, and test understanding. The interviewee should be able to rationally and confidently discuss issues such as:\n\npotential competitor response, including the strength of the competitors\nmarket growth\ngeography – location of key customers\nsupply chain issues\npower of customers\nrisk- the Air Taxi market is considerably riskier than the corporate jet market\nprofitability – the air taxi market has few if any competitors and Eclipse Aerospace may be able to command a higher margin\n\nPorter’s five forces is a useful framework to employ in comparing the two markets.\nQuestion #4: The CEO of Eclipse Aerospace has also indicated he wants to know how many Jets the company needs to sell in its first year to break even ignoring sunk costs. It would be helpful if you could provide a rough estimate.\nPossible Answer:\nBreak-even Volume = fixed cost / net profit margin per unit = fixed cost / (price – variable cost)\nIf the interviewee does not recall the formula then give it to him/her and still require him/her to perform the calculation.\nThe interviewee will need to ask appropriate questions to obtain the information he/she needs to perform the calculation. Price and cost information are provided above.\n\nAnnual fixed costs = $5m + $14m + $25m + $1m + $5m = $50m\nThe price of a Eclipse 500 jet = $1.5m\nVariable costs = $100K + $1m + $300K = $1.4m per jet\nBreak-even volume of jets = $50m / ($1.5m – $1.4m) = 500 jets\n\n5. Conclusion: The CEO of Eclipse Aerospace has just entered the room. He looks at you and says “So, what are your thoughts on my new plane?” How do you answer him?\nPossible Answer:\nThe interviewer should look for the interviewee to be structured and concise here. A strong candidate should pull approximately three key points that have been discussed and summarize them appropriately for the CEO. The interviewee should also indicate the next steps they would take in the project, e.g. confirm estimated financials, conduct marketing research to refine market, etc. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: estimate, guesstimate.\nConsulting Firm: Gartner 1st round summer internship job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: transportation; airlines.\nCase Interview Question #00703: The La Guardia Airport (IATA: LGA) is an airport in the northern part of the New York City borough of Queens. The airport is on the waterfront of Flushing Bay and Bowery Bay, in East Elmhurst and borders the neighborhoods of East Elmhurst, Astoria, and Jackson Heights.\nYour client has just started operating vending carts that sell novelty items in high traffic areas, such as at shopping malls, airports, train stations and subway stops. The client is considering installing a cart at LaGuardia airport. He wishes to analyze the potential market of this location and has therefore hired you to help him find a way to determine how many people fly in and out of the LaGuardia Airport daily. How would you go about this case?\nPossible Answer:\nThis is a good example of a “market sizing” case in which an estimate is required to gauge market size. The interviewer here does not wish for the candidate to go through detailed calculation and arrive at a final number; instead, the question tests the interviewee’s ability to make form a structured approach that can be used to find an answer. The best way to approach this case is to make reasonable assumptions and communicate them to the interviewer as you proceed.\nCandidate: In order to get to the number of travelers that come through the airport, I’m going to try and estimate the number of flights that take off and land daily and multiply that by the number of average seats per flight.\nInterviewer: That sounds like a reasonable assumption. What kind of information would you need to do that?\nCandidate: To begin with, I would need to know the hours of operation of the airport, and how many of those are peak hours versus off peak hours. Would the client be able to provide me with this information?\nInterviewer: Unfortunately, the client has no information on airport operations since this is an entirely new venture for them.\nCandidate: In that case, I would make an assumption based on my own experience. Let’s assume that the airport operate 16 hours a day, 8 of which are peak traffic hours and 8 of which are off-peak hours.\nInterviewer: I think that’s a reasonable assumption. What other assumptions would you need to make?\nCandidate: I would also need to know how often planes take off and land during those two types of hours. I’m going to assume, again based on my own experience, that a plane takes off (or lands) every 3 minutes during peak hours, and every 6 minutes during off-peak hours. In order to get the total number of planes, I would need to multiply by the number of runways. This would give me a total number of planes per day.\nInterviewer: That also sounds reasonable, what else would you need to know?\nCandidate: In order to get to the number of travelers, I would need to multiply my number of total airplanes by the number of passengers per plane. Big airplanes like Boeing 747 can seat more than 200 people, while small jet usually has a capacity of 150 people. I would assume that every plane, on average, can seat 180 people. In addition, I would assume that during peak hours, a plane is 90% full, while during off-peak hours, a place is 70% full.\nInterviewer: OK, the last time I checked, LaGuardia Airport has two runways. Now, can you calculate the number of people fly in and out of LaGuardia Airport daily?\nCandidate: Every day 8 hours are peak hours during which a plane takes off or lands every 3 minutes, that will give: 8 * (60 min / 3 min) = 160 flights; 8 hours are off-peak hours during which a plane takes off or lands every 6 minutes, that will give: 8 * (60 min / 6 min) = 80 flights. So, 160 flights * 180 people/flight * 90% + 80 flights * 180 people/flight * 70% = 36,000 per day per runway.\nMultiplying that number by 2 runways will give us 72,000 people fly in and out of LaGuardia Airport every day.\nInterviewer: Very good! As far as I know, in 2011 the LaGuardia Airport handled 24.1 million passengers. In 2012, LaGuardia Airport had a strong growth in passenger traffic, with about 25.7 million passengers used the airport. So, your number 72,000 per day is not too far off.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

(NYSE: T) is an American multinational telecommunications corporation headquartered at Whitacre Tower in downtown Dallas, Texas. AT&T is one of the largest providers both of mobile telephony and of fixed telephony (including Local Services and Long Distance Services) in the United States, and also provides broadband subscription television services. As of 2013, it is the 21st largest mobile telecom operator in the world, with over 107.9 million mobile customers and annual revenues of USD $67 billion.\nYou are in a meeting with the CFO of AT&T. The CFO has asked you to develop a program that will reduce AT&T’s overall costs by USD $2 billion a year. The CFO would like you to suggest areas of focus, using a structured approach, and to identify risks and performance indicators for your cost reduction strategy.\nAdditional Information: Provide the following information if requested\n1. Revenue Breakdown ($67B) and growth\n\nLocal Services: $33B, down 1.6% from last year\nLong Distance Services: $2B, up 33% from last year\nInformation Services: $6B, down 10% from last year\nBroadband Services: $1B, up 35% from last year\nWireless Services: $25B, up 15% from last year.\n75-200 difference services across those 5 units\n\n2. Other Information\n\nOperating Income = 20% of revenue, down 50% from last year\nOperating Expenses = $54B, up 15% from last year\n203,000 salaried employees, down from 228,000 last year\nWeighted average salary = $80,000 per year per employee\nExpecting a 4% salary increase this year\nExternal Expenditures (part of Operating Expenses) = $49B\nOf that $49B, $37B is direct external expenditures, $12B is capital expenditures\nThere are about 50,000 suppliers\n\n3. Current Strategies include: (Interviewee could suggest some of these, but feel free to bring them up)\n\nBundling of services\nDebt reduction program: $53B down to $45B\nAccelerated deployment of broadband services\nEnterprise services growing, expect 1200 new customers this year\nFocused capital expenditures – on growth\nGeographic focus: U.S. only\nCost Reduction Goal: $2B annually\n\nPossible Answer:\nFor the cost reduction strategy, the interviewee should work towards a logical solution with a few major options, and then go into more detail about one or more of them.\nPossible solution to reduce costs.\n1. Consolidate suppliers\n\nBundling\nBulk discounts\nContracts\n\n2. Outsource functions\n\nCall centers\nServices\nManufacturing / Operations / Logistics\n\n3. Focus Areas\n\nGrowth Businesses\n\nBroadband\nLong Distance\nWireless\n\n\nNon-growth\n\nLocal – reduce / divest?\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThe “key” to this case is a dialogue between the interviewer and interviewee that brings the focus to Local Services, where 50% of the corporation’s revenue is made.\nSome math:\n\nLocal Services, $33B dropping 1.6% is a loss of about $0.528B.\nInfo Services, $6B dropping 10% is about $0.6B.\n\nBoth are about equal areas of concern, though Local Services should be the main focus.\nThe interviewee may ask about costs associated with local services. There are 60,000 technicians employed by the corporation, and they are in a union. It is a declining business model – most services, maintenance, and repairs are handled by computer systems, so there is little need for the number of technicians currently employed. If just 10%, or 6,000 of the technicians are let go, at $80,000 per employee per year, that equates to a savings of $0.48B, or about 25% of the cost reduction target.\nThe reduction in headcount of technicians in local services is one option. However, this option carries some risks.\nRisks\n\nLoss of services.\nCustomer base – meeting the needs / demands of the customer base in a timely fashion.\nCompetition – what are the competitors doing? How do they handle service calls?\n\nPerformance Indicators\n\nCost tracking – improvements\nEfficiency improvements – service calls, repairs\nCustomer service / satisfaction surveys\nProduct offerings\n\nThere should be other considerations brought up by the interviewee. The reduction in available technicians may require the establishment of a call center to handle perhaps an increase in service calls that cannot be handled by computers automatically, or without human intervention. There may be start-up, training, and maintenance costs associated with this call center.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new product.\nConsulting Firm: NERA Economic Consulting first round summer internship job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: food & beverages.\nCase Interview Question #00704: The Coca Cola Company (NYSE: KO) is a multinational beverage corporation and manufacturer, retailer and marketer of nonalcoholic beverage headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. The company is best known for its flagship product Coca-Cola beverage, and it currently offers more than 500 brands in  over 200 countries or territories and serves over 1.7 billion servings each day.\nYou are meeting with the head of new product development for Coca Cola Company to discuss a new product delivery platform Coca Cola has developed. Coca Cola does not generally make its delivery platforms – it is usually delivered through fountains or vending machines. But Coca Cola has recently been looking into developing a new vending machine. It’s at the first level of screening. It was born out of an idea the engineers at Coca Cola came up with and this executive needs to know whether to use the vending machine or kill the idea.\nThis vending machine can change prices as the temperature changes. If it’s hotter outside, the price to the consumer will be higher. If it’s cooler, the price goes down accordingly. Assume there is no extra cost to making these new vending machines and that they can be easily implemented. How would you evaluate this idea and what is your recommendation?\nAdditional Information: (Provide the following information if requested by interviewee) \n\nCoca Cola sales are seasonal – about 60% is bought in summer.\nA can of Coke sells for around $1.00. Costs to produce are: 20 cents manufacturing and 75 cents in marketing. So there is 5 cents profit on each can.\nCoca Cola does not expect to make more money on sales through this vending machine. It expects the high prices (in hotter weather) and low prices (in colder weather) to even out to be similar to current revenues.\n\nPossible Answer:\n1. Areas of Discussion\n(If the interviewee is really struggling) What problem at Coke might the engineers have been reacting to when they decided to develop this machine?\n\nWhat problems were they trying to solve?\nWas it an attempt to reduce frequency with which Coke becomes “flat” in the summer?\nWas there an existing delivery problem that prompted Coke to take a shot at delivering Coke themselves?\nAnything else?\n\n(If the third bullet has been revealed) Coke isn’t expecting to make more money, but what might they be trying to achieve? Think about the profit tree.\n(If the interviewee thinks this is a no-lose idea) What might Coke want to think about before introducing this delivery system? How might people react to it?\n2. Recommended Conclusion\nThis is really a problem about two things:\n\nsupply chain management/forecasting.\nhow customers will react.\n\nThe benefit of this machine is that it allows Coke to better forecast demand (by stabilizing demand throughout the year) and therefore better manage its supply chain and make distribution easier. While that might cut costs slightly, only 20 cents of every 95 cents is from manufacturing. The major cost is marketing. If it needs to cut costs it should look at marketing. Why? Because the reaction the public could have to this machine is dangerous.\nCoca Cola is thought of as an all-American product. Changing prices with weather is not aligned with the way people see the product. They might feel cheated by the machine. The interviewee should definitely have touched on: cost savings, supply chain/forecasting issues and public perception.\nOne point that the interviewee may want to explore is the fact that the machine only monitors the temperature and price for Coke – it doesn’t necessarily generate more or less demand when it’s hotter or colder – that trick is still confined to consumer behavior.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: increase sales; business competition.\nConsulting Firm: Alvarez & Marsal (A&M) first round summer internship job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: entertainment; mass media.\nCase Interview Question #00706: Blue Sky Studios is an American computer animation film studio based in Greenwich, Connecticut. Using its in-house rendering software, the studio had worked on visual effects for commercials and films, before releasing in 2002 its first animated film, Ice Age, and completely dedicated to producing animated films.\nYou work for a major New York City consulting firm and have just met with Chris Wedge, CEO of Blue Sky Studios. Mr. Wedge is concerned because DVD sales were much lower than had been projected for the studio’s latest release – Epic. Further, he is also concerned that this decline in sales will repeat itself with the studio’s next release, Ice Age 4: Continental Drift. You must decide, should he be worried about the decline and if so, what actions should he take to counter this potential downturn?\nAdditional Information: Provide the following information if requested\n1. Company\nBlue Sky Studios has been highly successful in releasing family-friendly, animated movies that focus on the exploits of talking animals and mythical beasts.\nBlue Sky Studios releases only three movies a year (one during the winter holidays and two during the summer).\nBlue Sky Studios distributes their movies through 20th Century Fox, a much larger movie studio. The distribution agreement between the two companies stipulates the following:\n\n20th Century Fox oversees the distribution and marketing of Blue Sky Studios’ films.\nFor use of 20th Century Fox’s distribution network, Blue Sky Studios pays 20th Century Fox 20% of their gross box-office receipts.\nBlue Sky Studios must also compensate 20th Century Fox for all marketing costs that 20th Century Fox spends on Blue Sky Studios’s movies.\n20th Century Fox has exclusive rights to distribute the DVD releases of any material based on previous Blue Sky Studios theatrical releases (such as direct-to-video sequels).\n20th Century Fox has the exclusive rights to produce and release television programs based on the characters in any Blue Sky Studios theatrical release.\n\nLarge movie companies can survive a bad year by relying on the steady stream of income their film libraries generate. Blue Sky Studios, having a catalog of only 15 movies, lacks that security.\n2. Industry Trends\nThe DVD market for the entire industry is shrinking. Consumers have grown content with the personal libraries they have amassed. The market for catalog titles is showing signs of saturation.\nThe home entertainment market is fragmenting as options such as the internet and on-demand cable have captured a larger portion of consumers’ dollars and time.\nAnimated talking animal films, which had been a consistently successful genre at the box office, are now beginning to underperform.\n3. Competition\nIn the past, Blue Sky Studios had only considered two studios as direct competition.\n\nWalt Disney Pictures, another of the Hollywood majors, has a long history of producing animated features for children.\nWarner Bros. Pictures, another major, has a specialized department Warner Bros. Animation that was specifically created to produce animated releases.\n\nRecently the cost of animation has dropped significantly. This has led to almost every studio, both major and minor, producing animated fare.\nMost of these recent animated features have focused on the hi-jinx of a group of talking animals.\n4. Technology\nBlue Sky Studios is a leader in the animation industry; however, decreases in animation costs have significantly narrowed the gap between innovator and follower.\nThe emergence of high-definition DVD technology has signaled an eventual change to the format. This will encourage consumers to reinvest in their DVD libraries. However, an industry standard has yet to be established for the technology.\nThe fragmentation of the industry has also opened avenues for potential growth. For example:\n\nThe Internet looks to become a viable source of movie distribution as sites such as Amazon.com and Yahoo have begun broadcasting films.\nMobile devices such as iPods, cellular phones, and the PSPs have also provided a window of distribution that had not existed in years past.\n\n5. Consumer Products\nBlue Sky Studios controls the licenses on all of its characters; this constitutes the third largest stream of income for the company after theatrical and DVD revenue.\nPossible Answer:\nThe purpose of this case is to challenge the candidate to tackle problems that are specific to the demands of a specialized industry. In this instance, Blue Sky Studios is facing growing competition due to competing technology, the commoditization of its genre and diminishing marginal returns from a primary revenue stream (DVDs).\nAlthough there is no single “right” solution to Blue Sky Studios’s problems, there are some that seem more sensible than others. These include:\n\nSteer production away from talking animal pictures to avoid the oncoming glut that looks to saturate the market.\nExplore less expensive direct-to-video DVD releases based on new characters. Through direct-to-video releases Blue Sky Studios can build their library, create new franchises and increase their consumer products revenues.\nExploring cash streams that new technology has made possible such as ringtones, ring backs, and online games.\n\nAdditionally, Blue Sky Studios should also be weary about jumping too quickly into a new technology. It must balance being on the forefront with moving to far ahead (for example, picking a high definition DVD format before an industry standard is set).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: growth; organizational behavior.\nConsulting Firm: Aon Hewitt second round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: life & health insurance; financial services.\nCase Interview Question #00705: Your client is the distribution department of MetLife, Inc. (Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, NYSE: MET), a major diversified financial services company headquartered in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. MetLife has been in business for over 140 years and is generally recognized as one of the most respected providers of whole life insurance in the United States.\nMetLife has approximately 10% market share in the whole and term life insurance businesses, two highly fragmented industries. In the last five years, MetLife has also begun to sell limited investment products including mutual funds and annuities.\nOriginally founded in March, 1868, MetLife completed  the mutualization process in January, 1915, changing from a stock life insurance company owned by individuals to a mutual company operating without external shareholders and for the benefit of policyholders. As of 2013, MetLife is among the largest global providers of insurance, annuities, and employee benefit programs, with 90 million customers in over 60 countries.\nMetLife, like many insurance companies, is divided into two parts – production and distribution. The production department is responsible for pricing policies (accomplished by actuaries), designing new insurance products, investing accumulated funds, and distributing benefits. The distribution department is responsible for selling new policies. MetLife employs a “captive agent model” which means that insurance agents (called Field Representatives) by contract can only sell MetLife products. All agents are independent contractors who are organized into 100 regional network offices. Each network office is headed by a Managing Director who is also an independent contractor, contractually tied to the corporate head quarters. Each network office has approximately 100 Field Representative attached to it. Managing Directors are all former successful Field Representatives.\nMetLife enjoyed steady growth over the first 140 years of its existence however over the last five years senior management has seen profits and market share stagnate. It has hired your consulting team in an attempt to reverse this trend. On the plane ride to your initial team meeting in NYC, you take a few minutes to brainstorm your new client’s situation in preparation for the initial team problem solving session. How would you go about analyzing this case?\nPossible Answer:\nThis case, like most cases, starts with a very broad question and asks the interviewee to suggest a basic framework and start to analyze the client’s situation. One approach is to utilize the Three C’s: Company, Customer, Competition.\n1. Company\n\nIs our product mix changing to meet customer needs?\nIs our pricing strategy optimized and consistent with market demands?\nAre we marketing our product appropriately? Has our advertising budget changed?\nIs a captive agent model still appropriate?\nHow has the introduction of investment products affected agent productivity?\n\n2. Customer\n\nHow can we better segment our customers to maximize service and profitability?\nWhy hasn’t our business grown faster on the coasts? What about international opportunities?\nHow are customer preferences changing with respect to insurance?\n\n3. Competition\n\nHow has the competitive landscape changed? Is the industry expanding or consolidating?\nWhat new services are our competitors offering?\nHow has our competitors’ message changed? How are customers responding?\n\nQuestion #2: After your initial brainstorming session with the client it is clear to you that the Field Representatives are the key to profitability at MetLife. You are convinced that if MetLife can just hire more Field Representatives or boost Field Representative effectiveness (e.g. profit per FR), MetLife will begin growing again. Furthermore you are surprised to learn how different each of the Network Offices operates and wonder if these differences are affecting performance. You identify three dimensions that may affect Office performance: Time Spent Recruiting, Density of Middle Management, and Time Spent Training. You run a quick analysis to compare average Office performance against Offices that are strong in each dimension. You use three metrics to evaluate performance: Profit/FR, Recruitment Rate, and 5 yearr retention rate of FRs.\nThe results of this analysis are contained on Figure 1. Excited with your results you rush to your engagement manager to share with him your findings. Based on this chart, what would you tell your engagement manager? (Note to interviewer: This is a complex chart so make sure you understand it before presenting it to your interviewee)\nFigure 1: Comparison of Top Performing Network Offices (NOs) across Performance Dimensions\n\n*Indicates Average of Top 10 performing NOs in category\nPossible Answer:\nThe interviewee should begin by analyzing the chart. The first column is the benchmark (the average network office) it should be compared to the next three columns (high performing network offices). For example, offices that spend a lot of time recruiting seem to be less profitable than the average network office; offices with a high density of middle management seen to be more profitable. The candidate should continue this way in order to understand all data. Once the candidate understands the chart, they should synthesize the data. Two major trends emerge:\n\nOffices with a high density of middle managers seem to outperform in all categories.\nOffices that spend a lot of time recruiting seem to underperform in all categories.\n\nNote: In the real situation on which this case was based, the reason time spent recruiting was low was actually due to bad data; press the candidate to focus on the density of middle management finding. Ask them to speculate on why this effect is being observed.\nQuestion #3: Having reviewed your results, your engagement manager declares you a rock star, but presses you to dig deeper. At his suggestion you decide to compare Middle Management Density across all Network Offices to see how it affects FR profitability.\nThe results of this analysis are contained on Figure 2. Again, you eagerly rush to your EM to share your results. What would you tell him this time?\nFigure 2: Middle Manager Density by Network Office\n\nPossible Answer:\nThis graph compares profitability (normalized by number of FRs) to number of middle managers per field representative. The candidate should recognize that the optimal number of FRs to have per middle manager seems to be 5 because at that level FRs are the most profitable. When the density of middle management is lower (i.e. FR/MM>5), representatives are less productive. Also, when density of middle management is too high (i.e. FR/MM<5) there seems to be a management overkill effect and FRs become less productive.\nAsk the candidate to summarize the graph. They should conclude that if all Network offices shifted to the optimal FR/MM ratio then system-wide performance should increase. For most offices this implies hiring more middle managers; for a few offices it implies we need to cut middle managers.\nQuestion #4: Much to your dismay your EM seems unimpressed with your findings this time. He finds the idea that hiring more middle management may boost system-wide profitability to be a long shot and states that even if we could elevate all Network Offices (NOs) to the high performing level, any boost in profitability would barely offset the additional costs of hiring more managers.\nYou disagree and decide to calculate the upside potential if all NOs were migrated to the level of the top performing offices. In order to simplify your calculations you look at Figure 2 and break all Network Offices in four groups as shown in Figure 3.\nFigure 3: Middle Manager Density by Network Office Simplifying Assumptions\n\n\n\nGroup\n# of NOs\nFR/MM\nProfit/FR\n\n\nI\n20\n20\n100,000\n\n\nII\n25\n10\n300,000\n\n\nIII\n30\n5\n500,000\n\n\nIV\n25\n4\n300,000\n\n\n\nNote: Average Middle Manager Salary is $100,000/year\nPossible Answer:\nRevenue from migrate all NOs to GP3 performance level:\n\nGP 1: 20 NOs * (100 FR/NO) * ($400,000/FR) = $800M\nGP 2: 25 NOs * (100 FR/NO) * ($200,000/FR) = $500M\nGP 4: 25 NOs * (100 FR/NO) * ($200,000/FR) = $500M\nGP 1 + GP 2 + GP 4 = $1.8B\n\nCost of additional Middle Managers:\n\nGP 1: 20 NOs * (15 MM/NO) * ($100, 000/MM) = $30M\nGP 2: 25 NOs * (10 MM/NO) * ($100,000/MM) = $25M\nGP 4: 25 NOs * (-5 MM/NO) * ($100,000/MM) = ($12.5M)\nGP 1 + GP2 + GP4 = $42.5M\n\nIncrease in Profits to MetLife:\n\n$1.8B – $42.5M = $1.7575B\n\n5. Conclusion: Happy with the way your first day on the study has gone, you pack up your things and head for the hotel. As you enter the elevator, you run into MetLife’s CEO who asks how the study is going so far.\nPossible Answer:\nThe interviewer should push the candidate to give a strong but concise conclusion. Here is one example:\nWe are working to reinvigorate growth for your company. So far we have focused on elevating field representative performance. It seems that middle management density is the biggest driver of representative profitability. If we can migrate all network offices to the optimal field representative to middle manager (FR/MM) ratio we can boost corporate profitability by 1.76 billion dollars. Next we plan to look at the cultural impact of such a switch as well a start to build a roll-out plan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The company began with the management of Kemper Lakes Golf Club in Kildeer, Illinois, an upscale public golf course in the Chicago area. To date they have only bought properties within the United States and Canada but are now looking to expand into other territories. In particular, they have recently been offered a large section of beachfront property on Jamaica, an independently governed Caribbean island.\nJamaica is an island country situated in the Caribbean Sea, comprising the third largest island of the Greater Antilles. With 2.8 million people, Jamaica is the third most populous Anglophone country in the Americas, after the United States and Canada. The client KemperSports is very interested in pursuing this opportunity but want your advice first. Should they proceed or pass?\nAdditional Information: Provide the following information if requested\n1. General\n\nThe property belongs to a world-renowned athlete who is looking to sell after 25 years of ownership. It consists of 15 acres of mostly beachfront property.\nThe island of Jamaica only has one other golf course, which is in high demand but not rated very highly.\nThe seller has agreed to allow KemperSports to option the property for six months. After this time period, KemperSports would either have to buy the property or relinquish their rights to it.\n\n2. Construction Costs\n\nThe island of Jamaica is non-union and labor costs are subsequently less than those in the United States.\nAs the island has several large resorts, there is a ready supply of water and food.\nElectricity is readily accessible and inexpensive.\n\n3. Government Obstacle\n\nIn Jamaica, non-citizens are not permitted to own property. Foreign entities must work through a title-holder who lives on the island. There are a number of companies that exist for this purpose; however, it would take some time to find a reliable agent with whom to work.\nThe property is not zoned for a golf course, but instead is zoned as a residential area.\nJamaican government bureaucracy is notoriously slow. Even without challenge, something as rudimentary as petitioning for a zoning change could easily take over a year to resolve.\n\n4. Environmental Laws\n\nFive hundred-year old ruins have been found on a neighboring lot. If any were uncovered on this property during construction, all work would need to stop. However, ruins are uncommon and chances of uncovering any are slight.\n\n5. Social Costs\n\nThe property neighbors on four large residential lots, all owned by wealthy retirees.\nFrom a preliminary investigation, the neighbors do not seem to welcome the idea of construction next door to them.\nThe only road that connects the property to the island’s main highway runs through two neighboring properties; building a new road would require going through one of the neighboring properties as well.\n\nPossible Answer:\nMoving forward with this business opportunity is not recommended. Buying an option would only allow KemperSports to delay its purchase decision for six months. Changing the zoning requirements could take well over a year to arbitrate and the decision may end up not being in KemperSports’ favor.\nMoreover, limited highway access, unfriendly neighbors and the potential of unearthing an archaeological find all stand as cogent reasons not to pursue the decision.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Born February 14, 1942, Bloomberg served as the 108th Mayor of New York City, holding office for three consecutive terms (January 1, 2002 – December 31, 2013) beginning with his first election in 2001. He is the founder and 88% owner of Bloomberg L.P., the global financial data and media company notable for its Bloomberg Terminal.\nMayor Bloomberg has asked you to come to NYC as a Diamond consultant and advise him on whether public Wi-Fi should be accessible to all of New York City free of charge. The Mayor has looked at several studies and has seen some research on the economic impact. What would you consider and investigate in other to determine whether Mayor Bloomberg should or should not take this decision?\nPossible Answer:\nThis strategy case is focused on developing an approach to the question. No number calculations are necessary in this case. The case is broken into various levels of consideration:\nLevel 1 – Would this implementation be useful to the NYC population?\nAnalyze the number of people who current have and do not have access to the Internet.\nOf those who do not have Internet access, identify the reasons for lack of access (two main groups)\n\nSupply side: People want access, but currently do not have it due to a number of factors: service and geographic gaps, price, slow/subpar access speeds\nDemand side: People do not want access because the do not have a computer or do not consider it valuable (think certain age demographics)\n\nLevel 2 – How would this implementation affect constituents that currently provide Internet access for-profit?\n\nIdentify affected players in the market (e.g. Comcast, AT&T, Time Warner Cable, FIOS, etc.)\nIdentify repercussions that will be faced by these businesses by identifying the populations they serve.\n\nLevel 3 – Estimate the revenue loss of affected players by sizing the population that currently subscribes to an Internet connection.\n\nHouseholds\nBusinesses\nAcademic Institutions: Schools and Universities\n\nThe candidate should understand that some of these may benefit from free public Internet access. How do you justify a decision to provide free Internet access to the current providers?\nLevel 4 – Identify advantages and caveats of the decision.\n\nWhat positive impact will come from this decision? How do we know? Benchmark other cities that have implemented this model to determine the upside.\nWhy Wi-Fi? Is there better technology out there?\nAre there other options worth investigating? E.g.

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: reduce costs; new product; math problem.\nConsulting Firm: IBM Global Business Services (GBS) first round summer internship job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: restaurant & food service.\nCase Interview Question #00695: Our client Freddy’s Frozen Custard & Steakburgers is a fast food restaurant chain based in Wichita, Kansas. The company opened its doors 10 years ago, and today it has more than a hundred locations in 17 of the 50 U.S. states. Freddy’s made its debut in 2002. In April 2011, the company opened its 50th store in Victorville, California, and in October of 2013 its 100th store in Bowling Green, Kentucky. There are currently 104 Freddy’s locations nationwide. It continues to expand at a rapid rate. Freddy’s plans to open 400 more stores over the next 10 to 15 years.\nFreddy’s menu items are prepared fresh, after order. Freddy’s offers frozen custard with a variety of specialty sundaes and blended concretes. In an effort to increase sales and face increasing competition, the company has just introduced a series of new products. While sales have increased in all 104 stores in the country, some locations have experienced decreasing profits. How would you help the company identify what the problem is?\nAdditional Information: Provide the following information if requested\nThe fast food chain Freddy’s Frozen Custard & Steakburgers used to sell only sweet products such as frozen custard,  mainly purchased as snacks or desserts. The ingredients in these products include fresh produce items such as strawberries, bananas, and other fresh fruits.\nIncreasing competition and stagnant unit and gross sales motivated the company to introduce savory products including steakburgers, hot dogs, and chicken sandwiches and increase traffic at off-peak hours (peak hours in this case are afternoons, when people generally have a snack or dessert).\nThe new products (steakburgers, hot dogs, and chicken sandwiches) include a set of savory products with ingredients requiring special ordering and handling. These ingredients also include fresh produce such as lettuce, tomatoes, and cheese.\nMost of the ingredients in both sweet and savory products include fresh produce.\nPossible Answer:\nAn appropriate structure for this case is the profitability framework: Profits = Revenues – Costs\nRevenues\nRevenues = Price * Volume, and in this case even as the new savory products are slightly more expensive than the old ones, customers have reacted positively and have started purchasing them. However, there has been some product cannibalization, and the unit sales of sweet products have experienced some decline.\nCosts\nSince revenues are not the main source of the problem, the interviewee should proceed to evaluate the cost side if the equation: Costs = fixed costs + variable costs.\nIn this case fixed costs haven’t changed. Most of the stores have been in operation for some years now, and the inclusion of the new products has not affected their operation significantly. Marketing and advertising campaigns have been recently launched to promote the new products, but the costs were evenly spread across all stores and are not of significant value.\nThe problem is with variable costs. Labor was already in place, and actually the new products increased activity in slow times, but there wasn’t a need to hire additional personnel. The new products are sold mainly at hours were the operation used to be slow in the past and has actually decreased slack time of employees during those hours.\nWith all other costs being negligible, the main source of the problem is with the food cost. The bottom line of the problem is that since the new products require special handling, the cost of some ingredients is not the same for all store locations. The company has national contracts with its main suppliers, but as stores are located in different geographic locations, seasonality and varying distributing costs has forced suppliers to charge these ingredients at a premium.\nQuestion #2: Given the problem is that the food costs are not constant for all stores, and that has decreased profitability at some locations, suggest potential solutions to address this situation.\nPossible Answer:\nExercise bargaining power over suppliers: Since the company has several locations throughout the country and has signed national contracts with suppliers, it could try to negotiate discounted prices for “troubled” locations.\nLook for alternate local suppliers: Evaluate the possibility of purchasing certain products from local and smaller suppliers, generally selling at lower prices.\nLook for alternate and cheaper ingredients. This sounds risky because it could lower the quality of the food sold.\nReduce the volume used. For the same reason, this sounds risky because it would change product recipes.\nIntroduce alternate items at certain locations: This is also very risky, as it would take away uniformity from the chain and may upset some customers. On the other hand, the company could take advantage of local food preferences and offer unique creations to cater local markets.\nChange the product mix: The total food cost is the sum of the individual food costs for each of the items sold. Promoting products with higher margins would reduce the overall food cost and contribute to increase profitability.\nCombos and promotions: Grouping low and high cost items in combo meals (e.g. entrée + beverage + dessert) could motivate clients to purchase more products and ultimately reduce the food cost by promoting a more efficient product mix. Also, through discounts and promotions of products with higher margins the company could improve the product mix.\nQuestion #3: Let’s suppose that you decide that you want to launch a campaign to promote higher margin products and improve profitability on troubled stores. You are provided with the following information:\nBefore New Products were included:\n\n\n\nProduct Type\nAverage Price\nAverage Cost\nAverage Weekly Units Sold\n\n\nSweet\n$5.00\n$1.00\n4,000\n\n\n\nAfter New Products were included:\n\n\n\nProduct Type\nAverage Price\nAverage Cost\nAverage Weekly Units Sold\n\n\nSweet\n$5.00\n$1.00\n3,000\n\n\nSavory\n$6.00\n$3.00\n1,250\n\n\n\nAssuming that food cost is the only significant cost, what should be the product mix the company should sell, including the new products, to return to at least the same level of profitability without losing the increase in revenue due to new products?\nPossible Answer:\nOld Profit = Total Old Revenues – Total Old Costs = 4,000 x $5.00 – 4,000 x $1.00 = $16,000\nNew Gross Sales = $5.00 x 3,000 + $6.00 x 1,250 = $22,500\nDefine Variables\nX = Sweet products sold\nY = Savory products sold\nNew Profit = Total New Revenues – Total New Costs = Old Profit\nNew Profit = ($5.00 X + $6.00 Y) – ($1.00 X – $3.00 Y) = $ 16,000\nNew Profit = $4.00 X +  $3.00 Y = $ 16,000 ————(1)\nNew Gross Sales = $5.00 X + $6.00 Y = $ 22,500 ————(2)\nSolving for X and Y using equations 1 and 2, you get that the company should sell 3,167 sweet products and 1,111 savory products.\nQuestion #4: How does the total food cost under this new product mix compare to that under the less profitable scenario?\nPossible Answer:\nOld Food Cost = $1.00 x 3,000 + $3.00 x 1,250 = $6,750\nAs a % of Sales = $6,750 / $22,500 = 30%\nNew Food Cost = $1.00 x 3,167 + $3.00 x 1,111 = $6,500\nAs a % of Sales = $6,500 / $22,500 = 28.9%\nChange in Food Cost = (New Food Cost – Old Food Cost)/(Old Food Cost) x 100% = ($6,500 – $6,750)/($6,750) x 100% = 3.7%\nQuestion #5: If the client company wants to negotiate the prices of new ingredients (savory product) with its suppliers to reach the improved profitability levels with the old price mix, what should be the price discount it should ask for?\nPossible Answer:\nTotal Target Savings = $6,750 – $6,500 = $250\nUnit Savings = $250 / 1,250 = $0.20\nDiscount = $0.20 / $3.00 x 100% = 6.67%\n6. Conclusion\nThe interviewee should have identified that this is a profitability problem focused on the cost side rather than on the revenue side of the formula.\nAfter addressing the main cost items, he/she should have been more extensive in asking questions about the different cost items and should have identified that the problem was with the food cost.\nAs the interviewee prepares to wrap up, he/she should be able to recap the situation and cite a couple of the potential solutions to the problem. Further, he/she could use the numbers to provide some insight about the situation, mentioning how the new savory products have a higher food cost and how can some of the solutions could be translated into tangible results.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: increase sales; add capacity & growth.\nConsulting Firm: Deloitte Consulting first round summer internship job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: entertainment & performing arts; non-profit organization.\nCase Interview Question #00696: Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts is a 16.3-acre (6.6-hectare) complex of buildings in the Lincoln Square neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City. The center has 29 indoor and outdoor performance facilities. Your client is the Jazz at Lincoln Center (JALC), a leading not-for-profit arts organization located in New York City. Under the artistic direction of legendary jazz musician Wynton Marsalis, JALC is committed to providing top quality Jazz performance and education to the world.\nFounded in 1987, JALC has been in existence for more than 25 years. Until 2003, JALC had been housed in the Lincoln Center Complex along side the Metropolitan Opera, New York City Ballet, and Julliard School for the Performing Arts. In 2004, JALC moved to the Time Warner Center – a high end commercial and corporate complex located on Columbus Circle. The move provided JALC with new, state-of-theart facilities, greater capacity (from 3000 to 4000 seats), and performance venues with expansive views of Central Park.\nJALC receives three primary revenue streams: subscriptions, single ticket sales, and donations. JALC, like all major performing arts organizations, relies on patron subscriptions to smooth demand and provide up-front cash flows. The general rule of thumb is that 50% of tickets should be sold to subscribers and 50% to single ticket holders.\nThe move to Time Warner Center has been a mixed blessing for JALC. In response to significantly higher fixed costs (rent, utilities, etc.), JALC had to increase ticket prices an average of 75%. However the move has also generated significant press attention and general buzz across New York City. Although attendance has been up since the move, subscription rates have declined in each of the first two years in the new venue.\nYou have been hired by JALC’s Director of Marketing to assist in boosting subscription rates. On your way to the initial client meeting, you take a second to compose your thoughts and brainstorm on the problem at hand. How would you go about analyzing this case?\nPossible Solution:\nThis case is meant to be a very open ended question, so the interviewer should push the interviewee to be exhaustive in his/her analysis. The tendency will be to focus in on pricing. That’s fine, discuss pricing but then get beyond it to identify all outlying issues. Many frameworks will work, here is one approach:\n1. Internal\n1.a Pricing\n\nObviously the increased prices are beyond customers’ willingness to pay.\nHow do margins compare with the old scheme?\nWhat would happen if we lowered prices? Less revenue, unpredictable cash flows, no upfront cash, low attendance at non-marquee shows.\nCan we maintain elevated prices but boost willingness to pay? More perks for subscribers, look for higher-end customers\n\n1.b Product\n\nHow has the product changed since the move?\nDoes the new venue attract the same caliber of performer?\nIs the new venue as or more comfortable as the old venue?\nHow does the location affect consumers’ willingness to pay?\nWhat else are we selling beyond a show? Drinks? Merchandise? Parking?\n\n1.c Promotion\n\nIs the advertising plan consistent with new location?\nAre we leveraging PR as effectively as we can?\n\n1.d Customers\n\nMarketing research to understand why old subscribers are leaving\nWhy do people seem to prefer single tickets to subscriptions\n\n1.e Company\n\nDo we have fixed costs as low as possible?\n\n2. External\n2.a Competition\n\nWhat new competitors/substitutes exist because of the move?\nHow did old competitors respond to the move?\n\n2.b Macroeconomic\n\nDo people still enjoy watching jazz? Going to performances?\nIs the general economic downturn affecting people discretionary spending?\nHow is tourism doing? Are we over the 9/11 backlash?\nWas their a shift in regulations because of the move? New taxes/zoning reqs?\n\nPart #2: At the client meeting, the Director of Marketing is convinced that JALC needs to significantly reduce ticket prices. She is particularly worried about subscriber retention. From 1993 to 2003, JALC had an average subscriber attrition rate of 10%. Over that same period, JALC had maintained subscription rates at 50% of house capacity. Since 2003 this situation has changed. The Director of Marketing presents you subscription data from 2003-2005 (see Figure 1) as proof that JALC needs to reduce prices. She asks you to take a look at the numbers and see if you agree. She further asks you to project what 2006 rates will be if prevailing trends continue.\nFigure 1: JALC Subscriber Data From 2003-2005\n\nPossible Answer:\nThe first key is to recognize that this picture looked very different in the past. Typically, 90% were returning subscribers and 10% were new subscriptions. In 2004, this ratio shifted to about 50/50. In 2005 it moved to 70/30. How does this insight change your view of the case?\nNext, notice that the new subscribers in 2004 resubscribed in 2005 (with 10% attrition). This is a good trend.\nNow, let’s project 2006. (Note: On the surface this seems like a gross assumption to make based on the limited data available. Lucky for us, consultants do this all the time. Press the interviewee to state his/her assumptions and forge ahead.) Break the 2006 subscribers into four groups:\n\n2003 and prior subscribers: They left in droves over the past two years, but those that remain are likely dedicated jazz fans and should stick around. Assume 10% attrition giving us 350 subscribers.\n2004 subscribers: 10% attrition from 2005 numbers gives ~550 subscribers\n2005 subscribers: Again 10% attrition from 2005 numbers gives ~380 subscribers\n2006 new subscribers: This is the most difficult to estimate. Looking at the last two years, in 2004 we had 650 new subscribers, 2005 we had 425. Based on this trend a reasonable estimate is 200 subscribers. Prior to 2003 we were regularly able to attract 150 new subscribers. The case mentions buzz and free PR so maybe we will be closer to the 2005 number of 425 new subscriptions? All in all, 200 seems like a reasonable estimate.\n\nAdding it all up, a conservative projection is 1,480.\nPart #3: Thanks to your convincing logic and comprehensive thought process, the Director of Marketing is convinced that your team can turn around JALC. As you shake hands and joke about the weather, a pained look comes over her face. “Wait a second. If we can grow our subscriber base by 10% a year we will soon have to move again,” she says. Calculate how long it will be until JALC is at capacity with subscribers.\nPossible Answer:\nThis is a “rule of 72″ (A rule stating that in order to find the number of years required to double your investment at a given interest rate, you divide the compound return into 72) problem: at 10% compounded annual growth a population will double every seven years.\nJALC currently has 1,400 subscribers; capacity is 4,000 seats. In seven years there will be 2,800 subscribers and in 14 years there will be 5600 subscribers. Therefore the answer is around 10 years. You would get an “exact” number as follows:\n1,400 x (1 + 10%)^N = 1,400 x 1.1^N = 4,000\nN = log(4,000/1,400) / log(1.1) = 11.0 years\nPart #4: Conclusion. At the end of your first day on the case, you happen to run into Wynton Marsalis, the Director of JALC, in the elevator. He asks how the study is going so far. What would you tell him?\nPossible Answer:\nThe interviewee should give a concise and complete summary of the key insights from the case. Press them to synthesize rather than summarize. A discussion of the next steps should also be included.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Cleary Gottlieb specializes in commercial property law. It has a commercial property team and a litigation team. It also has a smaller Trusts/Estates team that is engaged by individuals from the firm’s various corporate clients.\nThe senior managing partners at Cleary Gottlieb have asked us to explore the possible reasons behind their partners’ recent drop in profit share, which occurred despite the fact that all attorneys at the law firm seemed to be working harder than the previous year. How would you approach this problem?\nAdditional Information: Provide the following information if requested\n1. Charge out rates\n\nPartners: $400 per hour – unchanged from last year\nAttorneys: $300 per hour – unchanged from last year\n\n\n2. Average annual billable hours\n\nPartners: 1,500 hours this year; 1,400 hours last year\nAttorneys: 1,900 hours this year; 1,800 hours last year\n\n3.

Billing practices\nThe law firm charges strictly for billable hours worked at the applicable hourly rate. No premiums or discounts are applied and no alternative billing arrangements are entered into.\n5. Workflows\n\nThe litigation team is extremely busy at present.\nThe commercial team is busy but coping.\nThe trusts/estates team is managing easily.\n\n6. Costs\nBefore providing the following Exhibit, ask the interviewee to describe what costs he/she would expect to see in a law firm. Then provide the attached Exhibit (see Figure 1).\n\nTotal costs for last year = $53.2 million\nTotal costs for this year = $49 million\n\nFigure 1. Costs structure of Cleary Gottlieb in this year vs. last year.\n\n Possible Answer:\nThis is a simple profitability problem which can quickly get out of control on the math side. The interviewee needs to be organized and methodical. The interviewee should identify revenue and cost buckets at an early stage.\nCosts are not the issue in this case. However, if the interviewee focuses on costs first, the decrease in wages should provide an indication of the solution.\nOn the revenue side, the interviewee should be able to determine the drivers of revenue (e.g. charge out rate, hours worked).\nThe interviewer should encourage the interviewee to calculate revenues for each year:\nTotal Revenues = (# of partners x hourly rate x annual hours) + (# of attorneys x hourly rate x annual hours)\n\nThis year: Revenues = (40 x 400 x 1,500) + (100 x 300 x 1,900) = 24m + 57m = $81m\nLast year: Revenues = (50 x 400 x 1,400) + (130 x 300 x 1,800) = 28m + 70.2m = $98.2m\n\nProfit per partner for each year = (revenues – costs) / # of partners\n\nThis year: Profit per partner = (81 – 49) / 40 = $800,000\nLast year: Profit per partner = (98.2 – 53.2) / 50 = $900,000\n\nBy this point the interviewee should be able to identify the reason for the drop in partners’ profit share. Do not settle for an explanation that just refers to the departure of partners and attorneys. That fact alone does not explain a drop in profit per partner (a departure of partners and attorneys might result in no change to the profit share or even an increase – as wage costs go down and there are less partners to share the profits). A good answer makes reference to the partner-attorney ratio having deteriorated (the “leverage” of the firm).\nFinally, ask the interviewee what steps the partnership might take to remedy the situation. Answers might include:\n\nhire more attorneys, particularly in the litigation team given it is extremely busy.\nconsider increasing charge-out rates.\nconsider whether to retain the trusts/estates practice area, given the partner/attorney ratio in that team is 1:1 (note however the law firm would also need to consider the negative impact on its clients of removing this service offering).\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new product, new technology; market sizing.\nConsulting Firm: Hitachi Consulting first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: automotive, motor vehicles; energy industry.\nCase Interview Question #00698: Toyota Motor Engineering & Manufacturing North America, Inc. (TEMA) is an automobile manufacturing and research and development company owned by Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp. (NYSE: TM). It is the result of a merger of Toyota Motor Manufacturing North America (TMMNA) and Toyota Technical Center, U.S.A. (TTC) in April 2006, and has its headquarters at the former TMMNA headquarters in Erlanger, Kentucky.\nYou are an engineer working for TEMA. You have just invented a new engine that is fueled completely by water. The new engine works like this: water-splitting catalysts first separate water into oxygen and hydrogen gas, then the energy released by the combustion of oxygen and hydrogen is used to power the engine just like a regular gas fueled internal combustion engine.\nWith the new engine, what would you do now?\nAdditional Information:\n1. Product \n\nWater-splitting catalysts can be easily produced with negligible costs.\nThere are no differences in the total production costs of a regular gas fueled engine and a water fueled engine.\nThere are no differences in engine performance.\n\n2. Infrastructure\n\nGas station can be switched to water easily.\nWater costs are minimal.\nHow would this impact gas station business models? What are the implications for sale to a specific company or industry wide? Consider network effects.\n\nPossible Answer:\nSo, what options do you have?\n1. Start a firm and manufacture engines for vehicles (cars, boats, airplanes, etc). Think about:\n\nAccess to capital\nManagement capabilities\n\n2. Sell the technology/patent. Things to consider:\nA. Sell the technology/patent to whom? Specific industry:\n\ncar vs. airplanes vs. boats, etc.\nMilitary vs. private.\n\nB. How would you price the new technology/patent? This new technology is a disruptor. Water engines will completely replace gas engines.\nUse the car industry as an example. The price of the new engine should be equal to the extra profit derived from the delta price that car manufacturer(s) can apply to a water fueled car. The delta price that the car manufacturer(s) can apply depends upon a quantification of the lower costs that customers will face by not having to pay for fuel. In order to determine such number, it may be useful to know:\nSize of U.S. car market:\n\n300 million people in the U.S.\n100 million households\n50M urban with on average 1 cars per household\n50M suburban with on average 2 cars per household\n150M cars, replaced every 10 years\n15M cars per year, 80% new, 20% old\n12M new cars per year\n\nFuel cost savings of water fueled car:\n\n150K miles per car over life of car\n25 miles per gallon of gas\n6K gallons over life of car\n$4 per gallon of gas\n$24K in gas saving\n\nConsumers are probably willing to pay $5K to $10K in premium (tax benefits / green image). Therefore, this translates into a $60B to $120B potential market just in car industry alone.\nC. Patents\n\nAre patents generally enforceable?\nHow complex is the technology?\nWhat are the implications for sale to a specific company or industry wide?\n\nRecommended Conclusion:\nSell the patent/technology instead of starting a new firm from scratch.\nSell to as many industries as quickly as possible. Target the largest players because they have the capital to buy the technology and the resources to integrate the technology quickly. Use competitive bidding to raise the price.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: improve profitability; operations strategy\nConsulting Firm: Siemens Management Consulting (SMC) 2nd round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: consumer electronics; household goods.\nCase Interview Question #00691: Our client is Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE: WHR), an American multinational manufacturer and marketer of home appliances headquartered in Benton Charter Township, Michigan, United States. The company is listed in Fortune 500 and has annual revenue of approximately $20 billion, more than 70,000 employees, and more than 70 manufacturing and technology research centers around the world.\nThe client Whirlpool is seeking to realign its business strategy in order to maximize profit potential. The firm has traditionally focused on internal processes to drive profits, but recent industry trends and competitive shifts are forcing key executives to reevaluate the company’s competitive strategy. The client has asked you to make recommendations to that end. What would you tell the CEO of Whirlpool?\nAdditional Information: (Provide the following information to candidates if requested)\n1. Company\na. The company Whirlpool Corporation sells a broad range of consumer appliances (ovens, refrigerators, air conditioners,  vacuum cleaners, etc.) and accessories through two major outlets: major retail outlets such as Best Buy, Wal-Mart, Target, Home Depot, IKEA, etc, and online. The breakdown is 80% of sales through major retail outlets and 20% online.\nKey Insight: $16 billion of the client’s sales are through brick-and-mortar retailers which gives those retailers an enormous amount of bargaining power (High Customer Power if using Porters’ Five Forces).\nb. The firm has traditionally used cost-efficiencies to drive profitability, and as a result has not focused on organic growth initiatives (revenue enhancements). Therefore many functional areas have become siloed and myopic, attempting to maximize functional profits rather than company profits.\nThe interviewee should ask about the major functional areas, and which are the profit centers.\nCost Centers:\n\nMarketing\nResearch and development (R&D)\nManufacturing\nCall centers\n\nProfit Centers:\n\nProduct Sales\nWarranty and Service Contract Sales\nAppliance Parts (for repairs, upgrades, etc.)\n\nc. The client has seen decreasing product sales, in large part due to consumer dissatisfaction with product and service quality. Executives believe that the blind pursuit of functional profits has driven focus away from delivering highly-valued consumer products and service offerings to the end-consumer.\nKey Insight:\nThe client has maximized profitability from the cost-side, and now needs to search for ways to grow revenues – siloed functional areas means integrated initiatives have not been utilized and that profit-pursuit at the functional level may actually destroy downstream value, preventing optimal profit realization for the company as a whole.\n2. Competition\nThe three major players in the industry, including the client, account for approximately 80% of all sales (the interviewee should inquire about the competitive shifts mentioned in the opening of the case).\nThe #1 and #3 players have recently merged and will now account for a combined 50% of all sales. Our client Whirlpool is the #2 player.\nKey Insight:\nThe interviewee should recognize that the client’s market share is therefore 30% (and that the industry as a whole is therefore about $66 billion – because 30% of the total market equals $20 billion).\nThe merger of the two major competitors will give that new company significant bargaining power with the major retailer outlets in comparison to the client. It is therefore likely that the client’s retail outlet sales will continue to decline. (High Competitive Rivalry if Using Porter’s Five Forces)\n3. Consumers\nThe client Whirlpool draws a distinction between the following two groups:\n\nCustomers are the major retailers who purchase the client’s products for resale.\nConsumers are individuals that purchase products through retailers or online.\n\nKey Insight:\nThe end consumer is not the direct profit-maker for the client – as a result, the client has traditionally not focused on the needs of the end consumers and have seen significant drops in consumer satisfaction with regard to the entire product experience (from researching the purchase, to the buying process, to warranty management to repair service).\nPossible Answer:\nThe main crux of this case is how to deal with increased competitive rivalry in a commodities business that is in large part at the whim of the powerful retailing outlets that purchase their products for resale to the end-consumer.\n1. The client Whirlpool should re-focus resources to increase selling through the online space to mitigate the increased competitive and customer power. However, have the interviewee think through the risks associated with such a strategy.\nPotential Risks:\nRetailers may pull the brand from their shelves if the client places too much emphasis on direct-to-consumer sales by sidestepping the retail channel. Can the client afford to lose the retail play completely given a current 80% sales level?\nMany end-consumers may not be comfortable purchasing online or would prefer to comparison shop in-store before deciding on a major purchase. Is there a natural ceiling to potential online sales?\nWhat additional costs will the client need to incur to increase direct sales? Does it have the internal capabilities necessary for such a play? (shipping, logistics, technology, human resources, etc.)\n2. The client Whirlpool needs to focus on realigning internal processes, metrics and goals to maximize company profit rather than functional profit. This will require a renewed focus on the end-consumer and on product quality. In essence, the current competitive and customer situation dictates that the model of pushing product through retailers may not work for the client, as the newly merged competitor will be able to offer better deals to retailers and take over floor space. By focusing on the end-user the client can own the “pull” for its products, and product demand will force the retailers to work cooperatively with the client and stave off competitive threats.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: market sizing.\nConsulting Firm: Cognizant Business Consulting (CBC) first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: Chemical Industry; Sports, Leisure, Recreation.\nCase Interview Question #00690: Our client is Monsanto Company (NYSE: MON), an American multinational chemical and agricultural biotechnology corporation headquartered in Creve Coeur, Missouri. Founded in 1901, Monsanto used to be a major producer of plastics, including polystyrene and synthetic fibers. It remained one of the top 10 U.S. chemical companies until it divested most of its chemical businesses between 1997 and 2002, through a process of mergers and spin-offs that focused the company on biotechnology.\nRecently, Monsanto is considering entering the business of making artificial turf and would like us to estimate the market size for artificial turf in the U.S. Artificial turf is a surface of synthetic fibers made to look like natural grass. It is most often used in arenas for sports that were originally or are normally played on grass. However, it is now increasingly being used on residential lawns and commercial applications as well.\nHow would you help your client estimate the U.S. market size for artificial turf?\nPossible Solution:\nThis is a market sizing case, so rarely is any more information provided. It tests the candidate’s comfort with ambiguity. The candidate should lead the discussion and start brainstorming on the possible uses of artificial turf from the beginning:\n\nSports fields\n\nBaseball\nAmerican football\nSoccer\nField hockey\nRugby\nGolf\n\n\nCommercial businesses\nResidential area\nAirports\nSchools\n\nHigh schools\nColleges & Universities\n\n\n\nAfter the candidate has identified some uses for artificial turf, prompt him/her to estimate the number of schools in the U.S. (or any of the places where artificial turf is used)\nPossible Answer:\nTo estimate the total market size of artificial turf in schools in the U.S., we have to estimate the following:\n\nNumber of schools in the U.S.\nNumber of sq feet of artificial turf that is bought each year per school\nPrice of turf / sq foot\n\nWe start by estimating the number of schools in the U.S.:\nNumber of schools in the U.S. = (Number of high schools) + (number of 4-year colleges/universities) + (number of 2-year community colleges)\n1. Number of high schools\n\nPopulation of U.S. = 300 M\nPercent of population age 18 = 1% (assuming population is equally distributed)\nNumber of people age 18 = 300M x 1% = 3M\nAssume 95% go to high school, then the number of people age 18 who go to high school = 3M x 95% = 2.8M\nAssume that on average there are 200 18-year-olds in a high school. Then the total number of high schools = 2.8M / 200 = 14,000 high schools\n\n2. Number of Colleges: 4-year colleges/universities\n\nPopulation of U.S. = 300M\nPercent of population age 19 = 1%\nNumber of people age 19 = 300M x 1% = 3M\nAssume 30% of people go to 4-year colleges, then the number of 19-year-olds who go to 4-year colleges = 3M x 30% = 900,000\nAssume that the average size of graduating class is 400 students, then the number of 4-year colleges is = 900,000 / 400 = 2,250 colleges\n\n3. Number of Colleges: 2-year community colleges\n\nAssume 10% of people go to community college, then the number of 19-year-olds who go to community college = 3M x 10% = 300,000\nAssume average graduating class is 200 students, then the number of community colleges is = 300,000 / 200 = 1500 community colleges\n\n4. Total amount of artificial turf\nMake the following assumptions:\n\nprice of artificial turf = $10 / sq feet\nlifetime of turf = 10 years\nathletic field = 60 yards x 120 yards = 60 x 3 feet x 120 x 3 feet = 64,800 sq ft\nadoption of turf = 50%\n\nNow we can calculate the market size for artificial turf:\n\nNumber of schools = 14,000 + 2,250 + 1,500 = 18,000\nNumber of sq feet of turf that is bought each year per school = 1/10 x 50% x 64,800 = 3,240 sq feet\nPrice of artificial turf = $10 / sq feet\nMarket size = 18,000 x 3,240 x $10 = $580 Million\n\nConclusion\nThe market size for artificial turf in schools in the U.S. is about $580 Million.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: investment; growth, expansion\nConsulting Firm: KPMG Advisory first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: Entertainment; Leisure & Recreation.\nCase Interview Question #00692: Universal’s Islands of Adventure, commonly known as Islands of Adventure, is a leading theme park located in Orlando, Florida. Opened in May 1999, along with CityWalk, Islands of Adventure was part of an expansion that converted Universal Studios Florida into the Universal Orlando Resort. In 2012, Islands of Adventure hosted approximately 8 million guests, ranking it sixth among United States parks and tenth worldwide.\nThe Business Planning group at Universal Parks and Resorts, the theme park division of NBC Universal that is responsible for the operation and maintenance of Islands of Adventure, must recommend to its CEO whether she should sign-off on a request to build a new ride in the Islands of Adventure theme park. The new ride will need a capital investment of $400 million. Currently, the market cannot support a rise in the park admission ticket price as a means to cover the investment expense. Should Business Planning group recommend that the company’s CEO sign-off on the capital request? Why or why not?\nAdditional Information: Provide the following information if requested\n\nGuests purchase a single ticket to experience all of the theme park’s attractions.\n\nAdmission revenue – Average $50 per person\nFood & Beverage revenue – Average $20 per person\nVisitors – 8 million / year\nDiscount Rate – 10%\n\nThis case will be solved on the revenue (not cost) side of the equation. Steer away from cost questions.\nPrice (Raising the admission/ticket price) – Since the Orlando theme park market is highly competitive, Islands of Adventure cannot raise the admission price.\nPromotion – In the company’s 50 year history, many of their theme parks have opened many new rides. On average, Islands of Adventure expects to see a 500,000 sustained increase in attendance (number of additional tickets sold) when opening rides of this magnitude.\nDiscount rate – While $400 million is a large investment, the interviewee should recognize that the half million additional people Islands of Adventure expects will visit the park each year is not that significant when the park already attracts 8 million a year. Disney has used a discount rate for its theme parks business of 10%.\nLife of ride – The new ride attraction will be built to the highest specifications and should last more than 100 years. Therefore, the investment can be treated as a perpetuity. For simplicity ignore any capital maintenance issues.\nPossible Answer:\n1. NPV Calculation\n\n500,000 additional guests x ($50 admission + $20 food & beverage revenue) = $35,000,000\nPresent value of perpetuity = $35,000,000 / 10% = $350,000,000\nNPV = $400 million (investment) – $350 million revenue = ($50 million) NPV\n\n2. Based on this negative NPV alone, Islands of Adventure should not invest in this project. However, ask the interviewee if he/she can think of any additional reasons that an amusement park might make in justifying a new project that appears will generate a $50 million loss (strategic benefits). These might include:\nLine reduction – Lines at existing attractions will become shorter with an increased number of guest opportunities. If executed properly, this could increase guest satisfaction and they will then recommend it to others and/or encourage a repeat trip.\nExtended stay – By giving guests more “things to do” while on property, this should encourage guests to purchase additional meals and merchandise.\nWear-out – Guests need an incentive to return to the park. Building a new, highly visible attraction could encourage guests to visit the park more frequently. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new product, new technology; pricing & valuation.\nConsulting Firm: McKinsey & Company first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: manufacturing.\nCase Interview Question #00689: Our client Moldovan Coffins is a high-end coffin maker in the country of Moldova. Moldova, officially the Republic of Moldova, is a landlocked country in Eastern Europe located between Romania to the west and Ukraine to the north, east, and south. Moldova declared itself an independent state with the same boundaries as the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1991 as part of the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The total population of the country amounted to 4 million (2004 Moldovan census).\nThe owner of Moldovan Coffins business has seen substantial change in his market in recent years and is contemplating the future of his business. Up until now, he has been in the business of building high-quality, handcrafted coffins largely by hand with a skilled labor force. Recently, however, he has become aware of a new technology that would allow him to build machine-made coffins with much less labor. Should he invest in this new technology? And should he even remain in the coffin-making business in the first place? Why or why not?\nPossible Solution:\nNote that this case requires the interviewer to drive key points in the discussion. Allow the candidate to formulate a plan and then prompt him/her to consider each of the topics listed below.\nQuestion #1: What strategic alternatives should the owner of the coffin business consider?\nPossible Answer:\nIf the candidate doesn’t get all of this, help them along since we need to lay this foundation for the rest of the case – We need to decide firstly whether to stay in the coffin business at all and if so, whether he uses the new technology:\nOption 1: Sell the business to a third party\nOption 2: Sell the assets of the company and shut it down\nOption 3: Keep operating as is\nOption 4: Keep operating and invest in the new technology\nQuestion #2: How would you figure out the current value of the coffin business? Provide the following additional information if the candidate asks for it clearly and directly.\nMarket Size – If the candidate asks for the size of the market, first make him/her brainstorm about different ways to determine market size. A good candidate should come up with at least 4 different ways, such as:\n\nCalculate from the market’s total population, population growth, and birth rate.\nReview of death records for a period of time.\nTake sample of the number of obituaries in paper serving given population base.\nCalculate from total population, average life expectancy.\n\nQuestion #3: Now make the candidate calculate the market size, giving them the following data:\n\nPopulation of Moldova: 4 million\nPopulation Growth: 0%\nAverage Life Expectancy: 75 years\nAge Distribution: assume a flat age distribution, i.e. same number of people at every age.\nBurial Customs: 75% of deaths are buried in coffins.\n\nPossible Answer:\n(4 million) x (1/75) * (75%) = 40,000 coffins purchased per year.\nNote that the candidate needs to quickly realize that every year, 1/75th of the total population will turn 76 and therefore (on average) will die.\nQuestion #4: Now make the candidate calculate the value of Moldovan Coffins’ business, giving them the following data:\nPrice – Coffins are priced at $5,000 for a hand-made high-end coffin.\nCosts – Material accounts for 10% of the direct cost, while labor accounts for the other 90%. COGS is $4,800 per coffin. Fixed costs for the business are $700,000 per year. Assume all assets are fully depreciated and ignore taxes.\nCompetition – The client Moldovan Coffins has a 10% market share and a relative market share of about 1 (if asked, you may explain that relative market share is the ratio of the company’s market share to that of its nearest competitor.)\nMarket Trends, Regulation, etc. – If asked about any exogenous factors, simply tell the candidate to assume that the market is expected to continue as it currently is.\nPossible Answer:\nThe candidate needs to calculate the value of the business now. This is a pure mathematical exercise.\n\nMargin per coffin = $5,000 – $4,800 = $200\nContribution Margin = $200 per coffin x 40,000 coffins x 10% market share = $800,000\nProfit = Contribution Margin – Fixed Costs = $800,000 – $700,000 = $100,000\n\nAssuming a discount rate of 10% (candidate can assume anything reasonable here as long as they are consistent later), a perpetuity with cash flows of $100,000 per year has a present value of $100,000 / 0.1 = $1 Million. So the current business is worth $1M whether they keep it or sell it.\nQuestion #5: So now what is the value of the company if it were shut down and the assets were sold? Additional Information to give if asked:\nAssets – Since the firm has been building coffins by hand, the fixed assets are essentially only the land and improvements. These are owned outright by the company.\nWhen the candidate asks for the value of the land, have them brainstorm ways that they might determine this. They should come up with at least 3 good ways, such as:\n\nLook for comparable real estate and determine recent selling price.\nFind comparable commercial real estate and determine the rent per square foot, then discount the cash flows generated by renting the property.\nDetermine rate of appreciation for property in the area and then apply to book value of current land and improvements.\n\nGive the candidate the following information and have them calculate the value of the property:\n\nBook Value of Land: $20,000\nBook Value of Improvements: $80,000\nYears Owned: 48\nAverage Real Estate Appreciation: 6% / year\n\nPossible Answer:\nUsing the “rule of 72″, a 6% growth rate will double the investment every 72/6 = 12 years. Since the property was held for 48 years, the current value will be $100K * (2 x 2 x 2 x 2) = $1.6M.\nSince the assets ($1.6M) are higher than the value of the discounted cash flows ($1M), then it would make more sense to liquidate the business and sell the assets.\nQuestion #6: What would the value of the company be if the owner invests in the new technology? Provide the following information if asked:\nInvestment – Investing in the new technology will cost the firm $1M.\nCost Savings – Material costs remain the same, but labor costs are reduced by 50%.\nProprietary Nature of Technology – The new coffin-making technology is being offered for sale by a machine tool company, who holds the patent. They are not offering exclusivity to any customers (i.e. they will sell to Moldovan Coffin’s competitors if possible).\nCompetitive Threat – It is not known whether the competitors have acquired or are planning to acquire this new coffin-making technology.\nCustomer Preferences – While the machine-made coffins are not “hand made”, the quality perceived by the customer is the same or better. It is believed that the customer will be indifferent between the quality and appearance of a hand-made and a machine-made coffin.\nBrand Impact – The candidate may argue that a machine-made coffin might negatively impact Moldovan Coffin’s brand. If so, ask them how they would test this (e.g. consumer research), but tell them to assume that it would have negligible impact.\nPossible Answer:\nSince Moldovan Coffins has no proprietary control over the technology, it is likely that competitors will also acquire it, resulting in an overall lowering of the industry cost structure. If this is the case, price will also fall as competition cuts price in an attempt to gain share. If we assume that gross margins remain the same, since the industry competitive structure has not changed we can calculate the new margin contribution as follows:\n\nGross Margin = $200 / $5,000 = 4%\nLabor Cost = (4800 x 90%) x 50% = $2,160\nMaterial Cost = 4800 x 10% = $480\nCOGS = $2,160 + $480 = $2,640\nPrice = $2,640 / (1 – 4%) = $2,718\nContribution Margin = $2,718 – $2,640 = $78 per coffin\nProfit/Loss = $78 * 4,000 – $700,000 = -$388,000\n\nSo the introduction of the new technology to the market might be expected to reduce industry profits, making this business completely unprofitable.\nCandidates could argue other scenarios, by assuming that the industry would be able to maintain higher margins than we have assumed here, so the answer may be different. They should recognize, however, that the introduction of this non-proprietary technology will significantly reduce industry pricing in the absence of some other form of price support (such as branding, collusion between players, etc.)\n7. Conclusion\nA star candidate will see that his/her time is nearly up and will present a recommendation for the client without prompting. If the interview is within 3 minutes of the end, ask: “The owner just called and said he has an offer to buy his business. He needs to know whether he should take it right now.”\nPossible Answer:\nGiven the credible threat of the industry becoming unprofitable due to the introduction of this new technology, the owner should look to sell the company as soon as possible. Taking into account the assets of the firm and the present value of the expected cash flows of the business itself, he should attempt to liquidate the business and to sell the assets for around $1.6M.\nIf the owner is unable to sell the business now, he can continue to operate the business as a cash cow, but should not invest in the business above what is necessary to keep it operating at its present level. He should expect the business to become less profitable as the industry moves to mechanization, and should eventually look to sell the assets of the company and close the firm.\nComments:\nThis case was given by McKinsey in one of their first-round interviews and is a typical “command and control” style McKinsey case. In this style of case, the interviewer allows the candidate to drive the case initially to explore possible routes to a solution. However, once the candidate has laid out a plan, the interviewer takes control and asks the candidate to solve a few specific problems before coming to the final conclusion.\nWhen giving this case, allow for some initial planning and brainstorming by the candidate, but then firmly take control of each of the “modules” described in the case. Try to move the candidate along through each of them, since in the actual interview only those candidates that complete all of the sections will be considered to have done well. This case tests mental horsepower and the ability to move to conclusions quickly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new product.\nConsulting Firm: Capgemini Consulting first round summer internship interview.\nIndustry Coverage: food & beverages; restaurant & food service.\nCase Interview Question #00693: Our client is Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX). Starbucks is an American global coffee company and coffeehouse chain based in Seattle, Washington. As of December 2013, Starbucks is the largest coffeehouse company in the world, with 20,891 stores in 62 countries, including 13,279 in the United States, 1,324 in Canada, 989 in Japan, 851 in China, and 806 in the United Kingdom.\nIf you have been reading the newspaper lately, you have seen the news about Starbucks and how terribly the company has been doing lately. The company planned to open a net of 900 new stores outside of the United States in 2009, but has announced 300 store closures in the United States since 2008. Starbucks has had no growth for quite some time and is facing strong competition from Dunkin’ Donuts, which has partnered with Baskin Robbins at many of its locations. Recently, the senior management of Starbucks is considering selling ice cream in their coffee shops. Do you think that they should add ice cream to their retail coffee stores?\nPossible Solution:\nThis “introducing new product” type of case is just to see how the candidate thinks. The interviewer (a consultant at Capgemini Consulting) has no additional information because this is not a real case that she has worked on, but rather just something she has been thinking about. The most important thing is that the candidate is organized and hits a few key points. Some key points that should be discussed:\n1. Customers: how are the customers at Starbucks different from those at Dunkin’ Donuts? – Demographics, income, purpose/time of visit\n2. Company: differentiating factors of Starbucks – the candidate must recognize that the atmosphere is a key differentiating factor at Starbucks (as important as the coffee!)\n\nWho eats ice cream? Children are major consumers of ice cream. Having large numbers of children running around Starbucks would threaten the atmosphere.\n\n3. Product Cannibalization: Starbucks currently has high profit margins on frozen coffees and baked goods. If its stores begin selling ice cream, they could see cannibalization of existing sales of these high-margin items.\n4. Operational issues:\n\nHow would Starbucks store the ice cream- current stores are not equipped with freezer space, so this would require major store renovations. Plus the freezers would take up a lot of space, which means that the seating area would be smaller.\nSuppliers: Selling ice cream would probably mean adding a new supplier.\n\nThe candidate should offer a definitive 30 second pitch for his decision (go or no-go).\nOnce the candidate has determined that Starbucks should not sell ice cream, ask the candidate what Starbucks should do to grow? The two things the interviewer is looking for is (1) Creativity and (2) Organization. Candidates should not just list ideas for growth, but should organize or categorize them. Some possible answers:\na. Introduce new product lines\n\nIntroduce a non-specialty coffee (Starbucks has now done this with Pike Place Roast) as a special offer during tough economic times to compete with Dunkin’ Donuts.\nBegin selling Starbucks ice cream in retail channels, but not in their coffee stores. (The company has also done this)\n\nb. Expand into new geographic areas\n\nAdditional suburban areas, slightly further semi-rural areas\nSelective cities internationally (Starbucks is getting increasingly popular in Asia)\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: investment.\nConsulting Firm: Cognizant Business Consulting (CBC) first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: software, information technology (IT).\nCase Interview Question #00685: You’re a friend of Mark Pincus, the co-founder and former CEO of Zynga (NASDAQ: ZNGA), which makes online social games. Recently, Mr. Pincus just announced that he was stepping down as CEO of Zynga and approached you to invest in a new software gaming company that he is starting. He is an experienced programmer and has developed a new computer game that he says “will sell like hotcakes.” He wants you to make a seed investment of $1 million. Your $1 million will buy you a 50% stake in the company. (Assume he is taking a 50% stake in equity for his work in developing the game).\nYou consider investing, but have some other investment options that can potentially give you a 50% ROI over the next year with the same risk as this online game company. Assume this investment is a one-year investment and no money from the company will be reinvested for the following year. Should you invest in your friend Mark Pincus’ new game company or in the other investment options that you have?\nNote:\nThe purpose of the case is to see how well the candidate can ask the right questions to get important facts of the case and work through relatively simple, but detailed calculations.\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate: In order to decide which investment to pursue, I’m going to surmise the gaming company’s potential profitability for this product over the next year. In order to do so, I’m going to need some more information about the company. To start with, how many people will be running the company and what will they earn this year?\nInterviewer: Assume that your friend Mark Pincus has recruited two friends from business school that will be handling all the aspects of running the company and marketing the product. They have prior experience in software sales. He is paying each of them $100,000 per year. (The founder Mr. Pincus is not taking a salary, just his 50% equity stake).\nCandidate: What about possible competitors? Are there similar products in the market?\nInterviewer: There are three companies that make similar games. There are six titles in all in this space. Each title currently has an equal share of the market.\nCandidate: OK, now I will try to estimate what this new company’s potential share of this market could be by products sold per year. In order to get to this number, I will estimate the target market size and then multiply that by the number of games bought per person in that market per year.\nInterviewer: That sounds like a reasonable approach. How would you go about getting to those figures?\nCandidate: I’d start by assuming that the primary gamer demographic is male, and between the ages 15-35. To figure out how many people fit that category, I’d start with the total U.S. population. Let’s say it’s about 300 million for ease of calculation. I would assume that the 15-35 age group comprises about a third of the total population, or about 100 million people. Males would number half that population, so the market will be 50 million people. Of these, I would assume that about 20% are gamers, so that they number about 10 million. Of these gamers, I would assume only 20% will like this game, which equates to about 2 million people. That’s my total market size. To get to the total number of potential unit sales of these types of games per year, I’ll assume that the number of games purchased by this group per year is only 1. As a result, I would assume 2 million per year in unit sales of this type of product for the rest of the case.\nInterviewer: That’s the total market for these types of games. What about for this company?\nCandidate: Well, total games bought per year are about 2 million, and there are seven possible choices of similar games. I’ll assume that the company can get an equal market share at market saturation, which equals about 14% of unit sales. Since we are only looking at the first year, however, this number is too aggressive. It is more reasonable to assume they can reach 10% of the market now, or sell 200K games.\n(Note: The specific numbers are not as crucial as the thought process of getting to the final number)\nInterviewer: OK, now you have a number for total unit sales. What would you do next?\nCandidate: Based on this potential sales number, I would try to estimate the potential revenue from this product per year. Assuming that the company will charge the going rate for video games, which usually cost about $30 to $50, I’m going to estimate that the company can charge $40 dollars per game for the rest of the case. To get to the profit margin, however, I will also need cost information. Does the company have an idea of what the manufacturing, packaging and shipping costs per unit will be?\nInterviewer: Unfortunately, the company does not yet have that information. How would you estimate it?\nCandidate: Since this is not a capital intensive product, I would assume these costs per unit to be about 10%-15% of revenue. That would equal about $6 per unit. However, I would also want to get a better sense of their distribution costs. Does the company have an estimate of what these may be?\nInterviewer: They do. In their first year, they don’t want to develop a direct to consumer channel due to the warehousing/distribution elements involved. Instead, they must sell the software through retail stores, such as BestBuy. The retail stores take 30% margin on the selling price. There is also a consumer marketing support charge from retailers that comes to 10% of selling price. This marketing fee covers all costs necessary to market the product.\nCandidate: OK, so the fee to retail stores is 30% x $40, or $12. The consumer marketing support charge is another 10% x $40, or $4. Are there any other variable costs?\nInterviewer: No, these are all of the variable costs.\nCandidate: Are there any fixed costs associated with the company?\nInterviewer: No, assume the fixed costs are zero.\nCandidate: Are there any taxes that need to be paid?\nInterviewer: Assume there are no taxes.\nCandidate: OK, with this information, I can calculate the expected profits for the first year. The company will expect to sell about 200,000 units at a contribution margin of $18 ($40 – $12 – $6 – $4), which yields a profit of $3.6 million. Subtracting the salaries of $200,000, we are left with $3.4 million. My share of this is 50%, or $1.7 million, which represents a 170% return on the initial investment of $1 million. Based on these metrics, I would definitely make the investment.\nInterviewer: Very good.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: pricing & valuation.\nConsulting Firm: Hay Group first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: chemical industry; mining & metals production.\nCase Interview Question #00684: Our client Dyno Nobel is a large manufacturer of explosive products. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Australian multinational corporation Incitec Pivot Limited (ASX: IPL), and has customers in the mining, quarry, construction, pipeline and geophysical exploration industries. Headquartered in Cottonwood Heights, Utah, USA, the company operates in Australia, Canada, the United States, Africa, Indonesia, Mexico, South America, Papua New Guinea and Turkey.\nRecently, Dyno Nobel’s largest customer, an American mining company, has called for a competitive bid for their next 3 year contract. Previously, Dyno Nobel has been their preferred provider and have run uncontested for nearly 10 years. Our client Dyno Nobel wants to know how we should price the bid. What would you tell them?\nAdditional Information: (to be provided after relevant questions)\n1. Our client Dyno Nobel provides three products:\n\nAmmonium nitrate (AN) which is used to create the explosion\nIgnition systems (IS) used to start the explosion\nSlot services which are contracting services designed to help clients understand where to place explosives.\n\n2. When asked why the bid was put out for RFP (request for proposal), the answer was that we are not sure but suspect it could be internal cost pressures.\nPossible Solution:\nCandidate: I’d like to take a look at this by first analyzing the external factors currently impacting our client (what the needs of the mining firm have been in the past and are now, what the competitive landscape looks like, and how the industry’s product mix breaks down). Then I’d like to do an internal analysis of the various options available to our client focusing largely on drivers of profitability. To start, what do we know about this mining firm and their current contract?\nInterviewer: The mining firm owns two mines, one in Kentucky and one in Wyoming. Previously, 80% of the revenue of their contract has been derived from AN and 20% from IS. They don’t purchase any slot services as they have their own people.\nCandidate: You mentioned the contract from a revenue perspective but do we know what they purchased from a volume perspective and at what cost?\nInterviewer: They purchased 40,000 tons of AN at $1000 per ton and IS at $250 per ton of AN (there is a predetermined ratio of how much IS you need per ton of AN).\nCandidate: Great. Next I’d like to understand a little bit more about the competitive landscape. Do we know anything about new competitors that have entered the market and how we compare to those firms?\nInterviewer: Nothing has changed from a competitive standpoint as we have the same competitors as always. We are generally seen as the market and price leader.\nCandidate: From a product standpoint, how do we compare to those competitors?\nInterviewer: AN is pretty much a commodity although we do charge about a $10 premium over our competitors. From an IS standpoint, we are the clear leader and have a quality product for which people will pay for.\nCandidate: Do all competitors provide both products?\nInterviewer: Our largest competitor does although they have bad ignition systems. There are other competitors for ignition system abroad that are closer in quality to ours and AN can be purchased from many places as it is a commodity.\nCandidate: Great. Now that I know more about the industry landscape, I’d like to look at the current and future profitability of this contract. We know that the client purchased 40,000 tons of AN at $1,000 per ton so that is $40 million in revenue. They also purchased IS at $250 per ton of AN so that is $10 million in revenue for a total of $50 million. Do we know the margins on these products?\nInterviewer: Yes, AN gets a 20% margin and IS get an 80% margin.\nCandidate: That means that we are making $40 * 20% = $8 million, $10 * 80% = $8 million of profit off of each component of the contract currently. What are the specifics of the future contract?\nInterviewer: It will be for the same components in the same volumes as this contract.\nCandidate: Since, the contract is the same as last time, we need to think about who we are really competing against to determine price. In this case, it seems that no competitor offers as robust an offering as we do. However, the customer still has the option to purchase the products separately on their own. Do we know how much they could save by doing so? Also, what would it cost them in internal costs to manage the process?\nInterviewer: They could get the next closest IS system to ours for $100 per ton cheaper by purchasing overseas. Additionally, let’s assume that they need 1 person at $100,000 salary per year to manage the process.\nCandidate: That means they will save $4 million per year on their own although they probably won’t want to do it.\nInterviewer: If you think they don’t want to do it, should we charge them more for our integrated service.\nCandidate: I wouldn’t advertise that to the customer even if we do decide to do it because it is poor positioning. Also, when looking at the number, we could make $16 million in profit so by looking at the scope, I’m not sure another $100k matters.\nInterviewer: Agreed. So what should we do?\nCandidate: Well, since AN is a commodity and since we make a much smaller margin on it, I’m not attracted to trying to reduce price there. However, as we make a much higher margin on IS, and it would be much harder for them to get these products from abroad, that may be a good place to reduce price if that is the mine’s number 1 concern.\nInterviewer: That makes sense. So what should we price it at?\nCandidate: Working backwards, I’m not sure that we necessarily need to give an entire $4 million price concession to our client as they do know that we have a premium product. Instead, let’s reduce our price by half that so that the maximum they will pay is $8 million for IS systems. That makes the price $200 per ton. Does that seem reasonable?\nInterviewer: It does. Now, make a final recommendation to the client Dyno Nobel.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: industry analysis.\nConsulting Firm: Boston Consulting Group (BCG) second round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: tourism, hospitality, lodging.\nCase Interview Question #00686: The year is 2004, three years after the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks. Our client is the Hotel Association of New York City trade organization. Established in 1878, the Hotel Association of New York City is one of the oldest professional trade associations in the nation. Its membership includes more than 270 of the finest hotels in New York City, representing more than 75,000 rooms and approximately 50,000 employees.\nThe client has come to us after the September 11 terrorist attacks to help them answer two basic questions:\n1. Estimate the monetary damages to the hotel industry in NYC.\n2. Help develop a recovery plan\nHow would you go about this case?\nPossible Answer:\nLike many BCG second round case interviews, this case did not really deploy a rigid framework. Instead it was a conversation about the issues that the hotel industry faced. As a result the BCG partner posed questions and we then had a discussion around those questions.\nFirst, ask the candidate what he/she thinks are the biggest issues facing the hotel industry after 9/11. A good candidate will identify issues both on the revenue and cost sides.\nRevenue:\n\nDecreased occupancy rates: Both from business travelers and leisure\nDecreased conference revenue\nDecrease in service revenue (restaurants, movie theaters, room service, etc.)\n\nCost:\n\nLoss of economies of scale increases average cost per room\nIncreased cost of attracting employees to work in NYC\nIncreasing advertising budgets to attract tourists/business\nIncreased investment in security measures (limited)\n\nAfter having listed all the items, ask the candidate which area he/she thinks is most important to restoring health of the hotel industry. Candidate should identify revenue losses as the biggest driver. Push the candidate to explain why revenue is the most important issue.\n1. Calculate Lost Revenues:\nTo determine the amount of revenue lost, tell the candidate that the hotel industry uses a measure called RevPAR. RevPAR, or revenue per available room, is a performance metric which is calculated by multiplying a hotel’s average daily room rate (ADR) by its occupancy percentage. It may also be calculated by dividing a hotel’s total guestroom revenue by the room count and the number of days in the period being measured.\nThe formula for RevPAR is: % occupancy * Average Daily Room Rate.\nThe Average Daily Room Rate for NYC hotel industry has been the following pre- and post-September 11.\n\n2001 pre Sept 11: $200 (highest in U.S.)\n2001 post Sept 11: $100\n2002: $125\n2003: $175\n\nAsk the candidate what information he/she would need to calculate the total lost revenue per year. Push them until they get to total hotel rooms.\nThe total number of hotel rooms in New York City is 100,000.\nBased on that how much money did the hotel industry lose in 2002 vs. 2001?\n\n2001 pre Sept 11: $200 * 100,000 * 270 days = $5,400,000,000\n2001 post Sept 11: $100 * 100,000 * 90 days = $900,000,000\n2002: $125 * 100,000 * 360 days = $4,500,000,000\nLoss in 2002: $4,500,000,000 – $$6,300,000,000 = -$1.8 billion\n\nNext, ask how much money was lost in 2003 vs 2001:\n2003 revenue: $175 * 100,000 * 360 days = $6,300,000,000\nIn year 2003, the hotel industry had recovered back to 2001 levels.\n2. Develop a Recovery Plan:\nWhat are the 3 things you would do to drive continued growth in 2004 and move the hotel industry RevPAR to $200. If the candidate suggests price, push them on this and make them defend it.\nSome possible answers:\n\nPartner with the city to increase advertising\nPartner with the city to promote safety and tourism in NYC\nOffer getaway packages – weekend specials, special treatments, etc.\nAsk for city loans to drive profitability recovery\nAdd free amenities to the rooms (movies, discounted room service)\nDiscounts the corporate meetings (free lunches, drink hours)\nStay 3 get the 4th night free promotions\nOffer tickets to movie theater and sporting events to guests.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "title": "Verizon to Enter Residential Home Security Market",

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new business.\nConsulting Firm: Mercer Consulting second round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: Telecommunications & Network.\nCase Interview Question #00688: Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ, NASDAQ: VZ) is an American broadband and telecommunications company and a corporate component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Verizon Communications’ operations are divided into three business units: wireless, residential and small business services, and enterprise services.  As of September 2013, Verizon Wireless had 101.2 million wireless connections, and its 4G LTE network covered over 303 million people.\nVerizon’s residential and small business services unit provides wireline phone service, Internet access, and television to residences and small businesses, via either copper wire or fiber optic cable. Verizon operates landline services in 12 states and Washington, D.C. As one of the nation’s largest providers of local telephone services, they are considering entering the residential home security market recently. Residential home security systems usually serve the purpose of burglary protection, fire alarm, and life safety. Should they? Why or why not?\nPossible Answer:\nNote to Interviewer:\nThis case was given by Mercer in second-round interviews. This is a broad, qualitative strategy case and was given in a very open and conversational manner. No hard data was provided – instead, the interviewer asked the candidate to come up with assumptions and estimates to drive the case forward. Therefore, there is no “right” answer, but the candidate must be able to come up with reasonable assumptions and then follow them logically to a conclusion.\nGive this case in an open-ended manner. Make the candidate come up with his/her own assumptions and estimates for everything. One set of reasonable assumptions is listed below – use these to steer the candidate back on track if they seem to be off the reservation.\n1. Market Size\nIf the candidate asks for the size of the market, make him/her come up with assumptions and calculate the total market size. A sample calculation based on sample assumptions follows:\n\nTotal Households in the U.S.: 100M\n% Households serviced by Verizon: 50%\n% Households that can afford home security service: 50%\nAnnual subscription price: $250\nTotal Addressable Market: 100M * 50% * 50% * $250 = $6.25B\n\n2. Cost Structure\nAsk the candidate to discuss what the cost structure might be for Verizon to enter the home security market. What are the fixed costs? Variable costs? Does Verizon have a cost advantage over other players?\nPossible Answer:\nThe home security business has very little fixed cost beyond the infrastructure already installed in potential customers’ homes (i.e. the existing phone wiring).\nCustomer would need door / window / motion sensors installed, which could be done by a third-party installer and billed to the customer at cost + markup and owned by the customer.\nVariable costs are also very small – essentially just the cost to maintain enough call center operators to dispatch police when alarms are tripped.\nVerizon does not seem to have much or a cost advantage over other players, since they are all using the common carrier phone network. Verizon might have some economies of scale in operating the call center, but this effect would be slight.\n3. Competition\nThe market is composed of a large number of mom-and-pop alarm company operators. No firm has over 5% market share overall, although there are some strong regional players.\n4. Customer Segments\nAsk the candidate to speculate on the various customer segments and their relative importance, size, and value.\nPossible Answer:\nWe can reasonably divide the customer base into urban and suburban customers, having different needs and different price sensitivities. Urban customers are likely to have lower incomes but a high willingness to pay due to the increased crime rate of the city. Suburban customers are likely to have a higher income but a lower perceived threat due to a lower suburban crime rate. By first-degree price discrimination, it may be reasonable to charge the suburban customers a higher price because they are presumably less price sensitive. We can assume that 50% of customers are urban and 50% suburban.\n5. Pricing\nHave the candidate come up with a pricing scheme and prices for each of their identified customer segments. There is no right answer, but they must justify why they are setting the price they are. Some areas they might consider:\n\nInsurance companies generally give breaks on homeowner’s insurance for having a security alarm. This will increase the Economic Value Added (EVA) to the customer and can inform pricing.\nWhat other services do homeowners pay for monthly? Cable, phone, DSL. How are the values of these services perceived compared to the value of the home security alarm?\nPricing will need to be competitive with other market players.\nThe candidate might assume a net margin based on the competitive landscape and use this with assumed market size to determine attractiveness rather than determining an end-consumer price.\n\n6. Regulation\nThe market is not regulated and government regulation is not expected to play a role.\n7. Marketing\nAsk the candidate what advantages Verizon might have in marketing vs. its competitors. Keep points the candidate should identify include:\n\nVerizon has monthly customer contact with a large pool of potential alarm services customers through its phone bills.\nVerizon already has brand loyalty for phone service, why not alarm service?\nShear size of the company (and deep pockets) make it more able to achieve scale economies in marketing and reach a broad audience.\n\n8. Conclusion\nA star candidate will see that his/her time is nearly up and will present a recommendation for the client without prompting. If the interview is within 3 minutes of the end, ask: “So, should Verizon enter into the home security market or not?”\nPossible Answer:\nThe short answer is “Yes”.\nVerizon possesses several small but important competitive advantages for entering into this new market. It has economies of scale in call center operations that will enable it to be highly cost-competitive in operating a security network. It has an established brand that the consumer associates with reliability as well as with networking and communications – the primary function of a home security system. More importantly, Verizon already reaches 50 Million households every month through its phone services bill that it could leverage to launch and market this new service. Also, the company has deep pockets and the ability to advertise such a service far more effectively than the small, regional competitors.\nThe size of the opportunity is large enough for Verizon to consider. Assuming a potential market size of $6 Billion in Verizon’s territory, even at only a 10% share, Verizon can add $600 Million in revenue. Given the low cost structure of this business and the high perceived value to the customer, this is likely to be highly profitable revenue as well. With Verizon’s marketing clout and customer reach, the company should be able to gain significant market share and become the national leader in this space.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: private equity (PE), investment; merger and acquisition (M&A).\nConsulting Firm: Bain & Company second round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: sports, leisure & recreation.\nCase Interview Question #00687: Our client is Apollo Global Management (NYSE: APO), an American private equity firm headquartered in New York City. Apollo specializes in leveraged buyout transactions and purchases of distressed securities involving corporate restructuring, special situations, and industry consolidations. The firm has invested over $16 billion in companies. As of March 2013, Apollo managed over USD $114 billion of investor commitments across its private equity, credit and real estate funds and other investment vehicles making it one of the largest alternative investment management firms globally.\nRecently, private equity firm Apollo is considering taking private a leading manufacturer of bicycle helmets Easton-Bell Sports. Easton-Bell Sports owns the Giro bicycle helmet brands. Should they? Why or why not?\nPossible Answer:\nNote to Interviewer:\nShare the additional information in each bullet only if the candidate asks for it in a clear and deliberate way. For bullets with “Explore with candidate” sub-points, make the candidate answer the associated question completely.\n1. Market Share\nThe bicycle helmets company Easton-Bell Sports is the clear market leader with 60% share in the U.S.\n2. Competition\nExisting competitors have small share. However, there are some new entrants that are still small but growing quickly, including sportswear companies Nike and Reebok.\n3. Channels\nHistorically, Giro bicycle helmets have sold primarily through the Mom-and-Pop specialty bike retailer channel. Channel mix has recently moved to 50% discounters (e.g. Wal-Mart) and it looks like discounters will dominate in future.\nQuestion #1: Explore with candidate: How are these changes in distribution channel going to effect the Easton-Bell Sports company’s future prospects?\nPossible Answer:\nMargins will come under pressure from discounters. But more importantly, competitors such as Nike will have a tremendous advantage in the discounter channel due to greater scale and leverage in distributor relationship. Also, a recognizable consumer brand (especially with the sports image of Nike) creates competitive advantage in discounter channel where an expert bike-shop salesperson is not there to push the HardHead product.\n4. Cost Position\nEaston-Bell Sports company and all competitors are manufacturing in Asia, so costs are very low. No competitor is likely to be able to realize any greater cost advantage. (Don’t let the candidate get distracted in finding cost savings – this is not that kind of case.)\n5. Regulatory Issues\nIn the last 5 years, most states passed helmet laws requiring cyclist to wear bicycle helmets.\nQuestion #2: Explore with candidate: What impact does this fact have? Draw a graph of revenue over the past five years and projecting into the next five years.\nPossible Answer:\nThis drove a significant increase in sales as helmets were purchased for the first time. This event will not be repeated, so sales will level off.\n6. Customer Segments\nThe customer segments that Easton-Bell Sports Company sells to primarily are the Adult Cycling Enthusiast segment, the Casual Biker segment, and the Under 18 segment.\nQuestion #3: Explore with candidate: How would you expect the purchase behavior to differ between these segments? What does each segment want in a helmet?\nPossible Answer:\nAdults purchase a new helmet infrequently (only after a crash or significant wear) while children must have new helmets every few years as their head size grows. Adult Cycling Enthusiasts are more concerned about having the coolest gear and tend toward more fashion-forward designs. The Casual Biker is more conservative in their fashion but still wants something that looks cool. Children’s helmets are purchased by their parents who care about safety but influenced by the kids who care about cool.\nQuestion #4: For strong candidate, further explore: What would you expect the market size of each of these segments to be? What are the implications for Easton-Bell Sports Company’s future earnings?\nPossible Answer:\nLet the candidate come up with all of the assumptions and then work the math. Actual numbers don’t matter much as long as the assumptions are reasonable and the math is done correctly. Note that 100 million households is the standard assumption in consulting.\n\nAssume 100 million households, 50% have children with 2 children per household, 75% of children ride bicycles, therefore: 75M Under 18 customers.\nAssume 2% of adults are Cycling Enthusiasts, or 2M.\nAssume 20% of adults are Casual Bikers, or 20M.\n\nSince the helmet laws created a large number of one-time purchases, we need to rely on the Under 18 market and new entrants to the adult segments for ongoing sales.\n7. Product\nFrom a safety standpoint, there is no new innovation in bike helmet design. From a fashion standpoint, there is much innovation, especially by the new entrants like Nike and Reebok.\nIf the candidate is having trouble exploring all of the above topics, provide some direction to help them along, e.g. ask “Do you think that there might be any government regulation that would impact past or future sales?”\n8. Conclusion\nA star candidate will see that his/her time is nearly up and will present a recommendation for the PE firm Apollo without prompting. If the interview is within 3 minutes of the end, ask: “The managing partner from the PE firm Apollo just walked into the room and wants to know if he should do the deal. What would you tell him?”\nPossible Answer:\nThe short answer is “No”.\nEaston-Bell Sports Company has been experiencing exceptional growth due to the one-time market expansion caused by new helmet laws and its historically strong market share. This unsustainable growth would result in an overvalued acquisition price.\nNew market entrants by Nike, Reebok and others will quickly steal share as consumers gravitate toward the general sports-affiliation of these well-known brands.\nBike helmets have been largely utilitarian, but the sports brands are likely to quickly move helmets into the fashion arena, putting Easton-Bell Sports Company at a significant disadvantage.\nFurthermore, with the channel shifting strongly away from the specialty bike retailers and toward the mass discounters, the national sports fashion brands like Nike and Reebok will have more leverage with the retailers, possibly commanding better margins, placement, assortment, and advertising support.\nThe only scenario in which the PE firm Apollo might consider the acquisition is if they have interest in another sports fashion brand that might be combined with Easton-Bell Sports Company to allow it to compete against the new fashion helmet brands such as Nike and Reebok.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: organizational behavior; operations strategy.\nConsulting Firm: Siemens Management Consulting (SMC) first round summer internship job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: healthcare: pharmaceutical, biotech, life sciences.\nCase Interview Question #00670: You are part of our management consulting team working for German pharmaceutical company Boehringer Ingelheim. Founded in 1885, the Boehringer Ingelheim group now is one of the world’s top 20 leading pharmaceutical companies. Headquartered in Ingelheim, Germany, it operates globally with 145 affiliates and more than 44,000 employees. The company’s key assets of interest are: respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, Parkinson’s disease, HIV, thromboembolic disease, cerebrovascular disease, oncology, diabetes and hepatitis. Since it was founded in 1885, the Boehringer Ingelheim company has been committed to researching, developing, manufacturing and marketing novel products of high therapeutic value for human and veterinary medicine.\nWe’ve been retained by the CEO of Boehringer Ingelheim to look at their current research and development (R&D) portfolio and assess whether they’re maximizing their potential with their current projects. Specifically, the CEO’s questions to you are:\n\n How can you help them decide what information you would need?\n What components do you think would round out an R&D portfolio for Boehringer Ingelheim pharmaceutical company?\n\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate if requested)\n\nCurrent staffing needs at Boehringer Ingelheim are at equilibrium.\nLayoffs and hiring are not expected to be necessary.\n\nNote to the Interviewer: Remember to make the interviewees brainstorm. You want them to come up with categories for this pharmaceutical company to consider when developing their R&D portfolio. For any questions, make sure you keep them on track with this goal. They should be naming different areas to look at, i.e. investing in current projects versus investing in creating new technology or starting new business.\nPossible Answer:\nFor this case, a successful interview would follow this “logical path”:\n\nDevelop a small framework from which they follow. Potential framework categories include Revenues and Expenses, Regulatory Environment, Internal Issues, etc;\nStart asking appropriate questions based on this road map. Example: “I would really like to look at the current state of finances for the client company. There is the possibility that for expense reasons, they may not be able to heavily invest in a lot of R&D Projects.”\nWhen prompted, conclusion should be short and sweet, like “In my opinion, this pharmaceutical company should really focus on 4 different categories. These are large investment versus short investment, longer projects versus shorter projects, new business versus existing business, and the mix over different business units. These will allow it to maximize its spending investment and reduce their risk by not being overly invested in one area.”\nThe 2×2 matrix should follow. It doesn’t matter which areas they pick to compare but the math should be easy. If there is a problem with the math, an easy prompt can be given without too many “points” being taken off.\n\nThe client company should be considering looking at multiple areas of its business such as:\n\n whether the R&D is for new business or current business\n new technologies versus current technologies\n spread of R&D projects across business units\n big projects versus small projects\n high dollar investment versus low dollar investment\n short duration projects versus long duration projects\n\nThere may be a few others but these listed above are the pertinent ones.\nNote to Interviewer: When the interviewee has provided their conclusion for the areas they think the pharmaceutical company should be looking at for a successful mix, please ask them to pick two and create a sample 2×2 diagram for you. Ask them: “If you were to look at these two areas, how would you suggest breaking up the expenditure.” See Exhibit 1 below for the appropriate 2×2 graph and sample calculations.\nIf asked how much the R&D expenditure is annually, answer with $100 million, but this information is not relevant to calculations and they can be done using percentages only.\nExhibit 1: Sample 2×2 matrix to break up R&D expenditure\n\n\n\nCapital Requirement of Investment\nDuration of Projects\n\n\n\n\nLong 40%\nShort 60%\n\n\nHigh 40%\nTotal % of All Projects: 40% * 40% = 16%\nTotal % of All Projects: 60% * 40% = 24%\n\n\nLow 60%\nTotal % of All Projects: 40% * 60% = 24%\nTotal % of All Projects: 60% * 60% = 36%\n\n\n\nThe main point to make sure the interviewee gets correct is that all four boxes together should add up to 100% and that each of the columns and rows should equal the percentage allocated for that particular category, i.e. 40% for long term projects or 60% for low capital investment projects.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Typically each person or couple in the home has an apartment-style room or suite of rooms. Additional facilities are provided within the building, including facilities for meals, gatherings, recreation activities, and some form of health or hospice care. The level of facilities varies between facilities. A place in a retirement home can be paid for on a rental basis, like an apartment, or can be bought in perpetuity on the same basis as a condominium.\nOur client is Senior Care Development LLC (SCD), a company that owns and operates retirement homes in U.S. The company has specialized in developing the full spectrum of senior living facilities, with an emphasis on continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs). They just opened a new retirement home in Chicago (The Clare at Water Tower) about a year ago and the management have concerns about the Clare retirement home’s profitability. So, we have been hired to fix the problem. How would you approach this case? What recommendations would you make?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate if requested)\nLocation: The new retirement home (The Clare at Water Tower) is located in downtown Chicago. All the previous ones were located in a suburb outside of Miami, Florida.\nThe interviewee should ask for the information that is presented in the following table step by step, and the interviewer  should not show the table up front.\nTable 1. Revenue comparison between the client’s old and new retirement homes\n\n\n\nRevenue elements\nOld (typical) retirement home\nNew retirement home\n\n\nUnits\n800\n400\n\n\nRevenue/unit\n$500\n$1,000\n\n\nTotal available revenue\n$400,000\n$400,000\n\n\nVacancy\n20%\n10%\n\n\n\nActual revenue\n$320,000\n$360,000\n\n\n\nPossible Solution:\nAfter giving the interviewee the data above, the interviewer should ask them what they think.\nFrom the comparison between the new Chicago and the old Miami retirement home, revenues don’t pose a problem, because demand is high (vacancy rate of 10% vs 20%) and price is relatively high ($1,000 vs $500). So, explore costs.\nIt turns out the client Senior Care Development LLC owns land in all of the retirement homes. What do you think costs of operating retirement homes should be?\nAgain, at this stage the interviewee should ask for additional information that is presented in the following table step by step.\nTable 2. Cost structure of the client’s old and new retirement homes\n\n\n\nCosts\nOld (typical) retirement home\nNew retirement home\n\n\nAmenities Total\n$48,000\n$54,000\n\n\n- Fixed component\n24,000\n30,000\n\n\n- Variable/month per apartment\n30\n60\n\n\n- Total Variable\n24,000\n24,000\n\n\nMaintenance Total\n$100,000\n$80,000\n\n\n- Variable/month per apartment\n125\n200\n\n\nUtilities Total\n$38,400\n$45,000\n\n\n- Variable/month per apartment occupied\n60\n125\n\n\n- Apartments occupied\n640\n360\n\n\nMedical Facility Total\n–\n$60,000\n\n\nSG&A Total\n$80,000\n$60,000\n\n\nTotal Costs\n$266,400\n$299,000\n\n\nTotal Margin\n$320,000 – $266,400 = $53,600\n$360,000 – $299,000 = $61,000\n\n\nGross margin %\n$53,600 / $320,000 = 16.8%\n$61,000 / $360,000 = 16.9%\n\n\n\nThe cost of operating the new retirement home is higher, however this alone tells nothing about the problem our client is facing. Let us go ahead and calculate the gross profit margin that is generated in different retirement homes. The new retirement home not only has higher costs, but it also has higher revenues. Consequently, margins generated by each home are pretty consistent, and, if anything, the new retirement home generates higher margin in both absolute and relative terms (16.9% vs 16.8%).\nHaving analyzed the performance of the new Chicago retirement home and compared it to the performance of a typical Miami retirement home that our client operates, we reached the conclusion that our client has no profitability problem. The new Chicago retirement home generates $61,000 margin versus $53,600 in old home or about 17% in both cases.\nOn the other hand, there are some significant differences in cost structure for the new and old retirement homes, so we need to study it in more depth and potentially reduce costs in both of them to generate higher margin.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The most familiar type of routers are home and small office routers that simply pass data, such as web pages, email, IM, and videos between the home computers and the Internet. An example of a router would be computer owner’s cable or DSL modem, which connects to the Internet through an Internet service provider (ISP).\nEstimate the annual market size for internet routers in the commercial segment (companies with 20 to 1000 employees) in the U.S.\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate upon request)\n\nFor companies with between 20 to 1000 employees, IT spending is about 5% of their annual revenue.\nNetworking is a subset of IT, and networking spending is about 20% of total IT spending.\nInternet routers make up 5%-10% of spending on networking.\n\nPossible Answer:\nThis “market sizing” case can be solved by starting from the U.S. population. First, let’s estimate the number of U.S. companies with between 20 and 1000 employees:\n\nU.S. population: 300 million.\nAssume half are of working age, so 150 million potential employees in the U.S.\nOf those 150 million people, assume 2/3 are employed full-time, or 100 million.\nAssume 60% of full time employees fall into the segment we’re looking at, i.e. working for companies with between 20 to 1000 people. This gives us 60 million.\nAssume an average of 500 employees per company, so 60 million / 500 = 120,000 companies.\n\nThen, make an estimate for revenue per head at these companies.\n\nLet’s say, on average each employee makes $80,000 contribution to company’s revenues.\nSo, at a given company, annual revenue per company is $80,000 * 500 employee = $40,000,000.\n\nNext, use the additional information provided to calculate the share of revenue spent on internet routers by a given company.\n\n 5% * 20% * 10% = 0.1% of total annual revenue.\n So for each company, annual spending on routers is $40,000,000 * 0.001 = $40,000.\n\nAnd for the total market, we just multiply that by the number of companies, already estimated to be 120,000.\n\n 120,000 * $40,000 = $4.8 billion estimated market size for routers in U.S. commercial segment.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: merger and acquisition (M&A).\nConsulting Firm: Oliver Wyman first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: sports, leisure & recreation; apparel, clothing & textiles.\nCase Interview Question #00673: Our client Riedell Shoe Inc. is a leading American roller skate manufacturer. The company was founded in Red Wing, Minnesota in 1947 by a former Red Wing Shoes Company employee Paul Riedell and his wife Sophie. For more than 60 years, this family owned company has produced the finest quality skates available in the market.\nRecently, we’ve been hired by the Riedell family to determine possible avenues of growth for their roller skate company. Currently Riedell Shoe Inc. is the market leader with a 32% share in the roller skate market, but their recent performance has been flat, both in terms of revenue and profit. They are specifically looking at whether they should acquire a company to drive growth, and are looking for our recommendation. What would you recommend the Riedell family to do?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate upon request)\nThe roller skate market is flat overall, with declining sales in traditional skates. There are pockets of growth in some niche markets, for example innovative, high-tech products.\nCurrent roller skates market share (U.S. market only):\n\n Client Riedell Shoe Inc.: 32%\n Company A: 19%\n Company B: 9%\n Other companies: 5% or less\n\nOur client, Company A, and Company B all offer a wide range of roller skates, primarily traditional models, but with an increasing emphasis on innovation. However, their R&D is not considered cutting-edge or even particularly strong.\nMany of the smaller competitors are much more innovative, and offer very targeted products that have high share in niche markets that our client does not serve. These new targeted products are also more profitable than traditional roller skates.\nOur client has limited experience with acquisitions. Three years ago, the client acquired one of its smaller competitors, and that company’s sales are now down by 40%. However, the management the Riedell family is confident in their integration skills.\nSuggested Approach:\n3C’s framework: Company, Competitors, Customers\nPossible Solution:\nLet’s look at the three areas of 3C’s framework: customers, competitors, and the company itself.\n1. Customers\nIt is important to understand why our client’s sales are declining. In this case, customers simply aren’t as interested in traditional roller skates anymore, resulting in declining growth. Customers want innovative, high-tech products and are willing to pay more for them.\n2. Competitors\nThere are two types of competitors, traditional roller skate manufacturers very similar to our client, and niche competitors who tend to be much more innovative. The traditional companies face similar problems as our client, but on the other hand significant cost synergies could be captured. Niche companies potentially offer significant growth opportunities and better profitability, if they have sustainable innovation capabilities.\n3. Company\nWe know that profitability is down in addition to revenue. One way to improve profitability is to reduce costs – and acquisition synergies could be a good way to accomplish this. In considering whether to make an acquisition, it is also important to understand our client company management’s ability to handle the integration phase effectively and without becoming distracted from their other responsibilities.\nNow let’s consider the possible steps the client could take. Basically there are three options: acquire a traditional roller skates company (A or B), acquire a niche company, or acquire no company at all.\n1. First, the client could acquire Company A or B, which would increase sales and supply significant savings via cost synergies.\nThere are a number of possible sources of cost synergies, some of the most likely would be\n\n G&A (General & Administrative expense): accounting, IT, HR, etc\n property: consolidate HQs\n distribution: consolidate distribution centers\n marketing/advertising\n COGS (cost of goods sold): purchasing\n\nHowever, this assumes that the client could successfully integrate Company A or B. We know from prior experience that  the client had problems managing one small acquisition, so this may be highly questionable.\n2. Another possibility would be to acquire one of the client’s niche competitors that operate in higher-growth areas. The client could use its manufacturing and distribution scale to produce more efficiently and to increase sales. These smaller acquisitions would be less risky than one large acquisition — the acquisition cost would be less and the integration would be less complex. However, the client would need to pick the “winners” among the target possibilities, companies with sustainable growth prospects, and this may prove challenging.\n3. If no target is available for a reasonable acquisition price, or if the client’s integration skills are deemed insufficient, then our client should not make an acquisition. In that case, our client could focus on organic growth, e.g., improving innovation and R&D, and cost cutting to improve its top and bottom line results.\nAfter carefully weighing all possibilities, my Recommendation is to acquire one of the smaller niche competitors to capture growth potential via better innovation combined with the client’s production capabilities.\nNotes to Interviewer:\nIf the candidate does not mention synergies as a rationale for an acquisition, ask them: What kinds of synergies could our client expect to result from an acquisition?\nOptional math question: Let’s say that we expect $4 million in run-rate synergy savings. What % of the client’s annual revenue does this savings represent? Note that the total annual sales for the roller skate market are $50 million.\nPossible Answer:\n$4 million / ($50 million * 32%) = $4 million / $16 million = 25%\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

As a large holding company, CB&I specializes in projects for oil and gas companies. Headquartered in The Woodlands, Texas, USA, within the Houston–The Woodlands-Sugar Land metropolitan area, they are a longstanding client of ours (Booz Allen Hamilton).\nThe client’s revenues are about USD $5.5 Billion a year (2012). They hold all sorts of companies, mostly around low tech manufacturing, including roughly three categories: “Oil and Gas”, “Automotive” and “Other”. As a holding company, Chicago Bridge & Iron doesn’t really have a unified portfolio, but basically places bets on companies it acquires. It is now looking at an auto parts manufacturer, and trying to get an idea of whether it should acquire the auto parts manufacturing company.\nSo, what kind of things would you want to investigate in order to find out whether the acquisition is a good idea?\nAdditional Information: (to be provided after relevant questions)\n\nThe client CB&I ‘s financial health is excellent – sitting on a lot of cash. Their portfolio is well diversified. They are not looking for “synergies” necessarily.\nThe target company is a medium sized auto parts manufacturer. They make mostly after-market products – winches for cars, trucks, ATVs (all-terrain vehicle). Annual revenues are $900 Million for this product line. They have 90% of the market in the US, and the market is expected to have flat growth.\nA second division of the auto parts company is drive train mechanism for switching car from 2-wheel drive to 4-wheel drive. It’s a small niche market, mostly for luxury cars.\n\nSuggested Approach:\nThe interviewer’s major concern in this case would be that the interviewee hasn’t developed a clear set of criteria for assessing the potential acquisition and used these to drive through the case in a structured fashion. There are a number of potential approaches but I would probably break it down as follows:\nBefore anything else I would ask for some more information on the potential acquisition target’s business. What products do they sell? What are their revenues and margins? Etc. Then I would analyze whether this makes the acquisition desirable by looking at the following:\nFirst I would want to look at whether this is an attractive industry to be getting into generally – The automotive parts industry seems to be generally consistent with the other products in their portfolio so I would assume that they probably have the skills to manage this sort of business, is that correct? I would also want to look at the growth prospects for this industry. Is the automotive parts industry expected to grow faster or slower than other low tech industry companies they may also choose to invest in?\nSecond I would want to examine whether this is the right company within the automotive parts industry to buy – in particular I would want to know to what extent our client could derive value from the acquisition. Will there be any synergies with the other companies that our client owns? Will our client be able to improve profitability by driving costs out of this business? Are there opportunities to increase sales or grow the business faster than existing management is predicting?\nFinally I would want to consider these potential improvements from a financial perspective. Does the client have a certain NPV or ROE target that it is looking to achieve before it invests?\nPossible Solution:\nQuestion #1: What were some options for the Winch products since the market in the US seemed tapped out?\nWe talked about markets not really existing in other geographies because it was mainly ATVs (all-terrain vehicles) and they weren’t as common in other countries. We talked about leveraging the technology and although nothing else could be made with it, they did discover a use as a “tool” for home and shop use (to lift bricks etc).\nQuestion #2: Who would the customers be here?\nWe talked about small contractors and home use consumers (do it yourself) I asked where they shopped and it turned out that small contractors shopped mainly at wholesalers and big box shops like Home Depot. The trend was moving towards big box. These shops only renew their contracts once a year with manufacturers.\nQuestion #3: How would you figure out margins for Home Depot?\nWe talked about how margins were based on margin/square foot and that you could ask for a small space, but keep it extremely well stocked at all times and keep our packaging small.\nQuestion #4: How would you bring in customers in this entirely new market?\nAdvertising through do it yourself channels on TV, magazines, in-store demos. (this apparently didn’t work as well b/c they had to send people to 350 stores to do the demos and for a small company it was too much).\nQuestion #5: He then wanted to talk about sales in the Drive Train component area:\nI asked about consumers, and we talked about consumers being both end consumers and auto manufacturers. I asked how often cars were redesigned and he said every 4-5 years, but the trend was going down towards every 3 years.\nQuestion #6: What does this tell us?\nThe opportunity to get in a redesign is better.\nQuestion #7: What does this tell us about the future as this time continues to go down? Is this an advantage?\nI said no, because now you will likely have more competitive pressure from those who saw this as a barrier.\nQuestion #8: Lastly, he wanted to know how I would evaluate the overall deal tactically.\nI talked about doing some sort of return on investment calculation to make sure the return was adequate, and that the results we needed in a particular time frame existed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: industry analysis.\nConsulting Firm: Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: healthcare: pharmaceutical, biotech, life sciences.\nCase Interview Question #00680: Lipitor, marketed by American multinational pharmaceutical corporation Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) as a calcium salt, is a member of the drug class known as statins, used for lowering blood cholesterol. As one of the best selling drugs in pharmaceutical history, sales of Lipitor since it was approved in 1996 exceed USD $125 billion as of 2012, and the drug has topped the list of best-selling branded pharmaceuticals in the world for nearly a decade.\nNow the real case question: what do you think is going to happen after the 2012 United States presidential election if Governor Mitt Romney wins and drug re-importation from Canada is legalized? I’d like to know what you think the impact will be to the  pharmaceutical industry in general, and to Lipitor in particular. If it’s negative, how can we (Pfizer) mitigate it?\nAdditional Information: (to be provided after relevant questions)\n\nLipitor is used to treat high cholesterol, and to lower the risk of stroke, heart attack, or other heart complications in people with type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, or other risk factors.\nIn the US, the Lipitor market is $7 Billion a year.\nLipitor is manufactured in Puerto Rico.\nWhat is drug re-importation? Drug re-importation refers to the practice of importing back to the United States prescription drugs that were originally manufactured in the U.S. and exported for sale in another country. Most often, Americans re-import drugs for personal use by filling their prescriptions in Canadian or Mexican pharmacies, either in person, or through mail-order or Internet pharmacies.\nWhy do consumers and other purchasers of drugs engage in drug re-importation? Because prescription drugs like Lipitor often are sold at lower prices outside of the United States, some Americans see re-importation as a way to potentially obtain access to other countries’ lower drug prices.\nDrug reimportation is not currently legal in the U.S., so is mostly conducted via the internet.\n\nSuggested Approach:\nI would approach this case the same way as for any other case involving a regulatory change and you can construct a series of questions that would get you to the right answer even if you know absolutely nothing about pharmaceuticals before you start:\nFirst, I would want to clarify what the change means – it appears that it means that drugs sold into Canada from Peurto Rico can be re-imported into the US – Is there anything else?\nSecond, I would want to understand why anyone would want to re-import drugs from Canada – it appears that drugs are available in Canada more cheaply than in the US creating market pressure to re-import them into the US – why is this the case? Why wouldn’t they simply be bought cheaply from Peurto Rico direct?\nNext, I would want to look at the extent of drug re-importation that is likely to occur – how much of the drug is currently sold in the US? In Canada? At what price is the drug sold in the US? In Canada? Are there any costs associated with drug re-importation? Are there any limits on the amount that could be readily re-imported (e.g. the total available supply)?\nFinally, I would want to consider the flow on consequences – will the drug companies put the prices up in Canada? Will they reduce the price in the US? Can they restrict supply to Canada?\nPossible Solution:\nQuestion #1: What is the impact?\nPossible Answer:\nI broke it up into a short term revenue impact and a long term impact on the pharma large margin model. I drew the value chain for the drug model:\nPharma Company, PBMs (Pharmacy Benefit Manager, negotiates price) -> Pharmacy (sells) -> Consumer (buys)\nIn between you have the doctors talking to the pharmacy and the healthcare plan ultimately picking up the tab. We established that the health plans will be pushing for this, and the PBMs will put pressure on the pharma companies as the gatekeeper to the contracts with health plans.\nQuestion #2: What will be the financial effect?\nPossible Answer:\nI asked what the pricing was currently. Lipitor is sold for $70 per month, and we were looking at $30 per month for the same drug in Canada. That meant the $7 Billion annual revenue would be $4 Bilion less. Big effect!\nQuestion #3: What can Pfizer to do mitigate if drug re-importation is legalized?\nPossible Answer:\nI asked if there were drugs that they sold in the US but not in Canada – there are. This is an option – they can bump margins on those products. They can lower costs (they should already be doing this but because their margins are so big, it’s not a priority). They can also limit the amount of cheaper drug output to match the Canadian market size (i.e. since Canada’s population is only 10% of US, they can release less and limit the market for the “re-imported” drugs).\nI also suggested pushing for longer contracts with the PBMs so that we could extend past patent life of Lipitor and keep margins, but the interviewer asked if the PBMs would have to allow that. They would also know when they were coming off patent, so would likely not sign those types of contracts.\nComments:\nBooz Allen and some of the industry specialist consulting firms will often ask case questions that are industry specific and require the candidate to demonstrate your industry knowledge. In a Bain, BCG or McKinsey case, it is extremely unlikely to ever expect you to have this level of knowledge about a particular market before the start of a case but they can still be used as reasonable practice cases.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

I was flying back from my client the other night, and working away on my laptop. Beside me was seated a mad physicist who used to work for energy giant General Electric (NYSE: GE). The GE physicist  first engaged me in a short conversation, and then he was very excited to find out I was a consultant working at Bain. It seems that he has created the first perpetual motion machine in the world. His machine requires no energy input, and keeps on going. The GE scientist wants to know how to make money with it. How would you go about it?\nNote: In general, a perpetual motion machine is a device which, once activated, would continue to function and produce work indefinitely with no input of energy.\nPossible Solution:\nWe started with a general framework on the things I would cover.\nQuestion #1: The interviewer pushed me into the category of what the perpetual motion machine might be used for and we stuck on cars.\nQuestion #2: The interviewer then asked me what the size of the opportunity could be.\nI did a quick market sizing, based on the total number of cars in the U.S., and what percentage I would guess are traditional fuel vs. alternative fuel (a small %), and then assumed a % of those bought new cars yearly and ended up with a large #. (40 Billion, I think)\nQuestion #3: What would convince these people to buy our perpetual motion technology in their cars?\nI talked about value proposition, pricing, awareness, proof of technology.\nQuestion #4: How would we convince the traditional fuel customers to buy this?\nQuestion #5: How would you price this? And how would this change over time?\nI talked about making sure we covered our COGS, and then looked at EVC especially in terms of actual fuel costs and time spent refueling, environmental feel good factor etc. I thought that initially we’d price at a premium and later in the life cycle when it was more mature, I figured we’d potentially be competing on price since other alternatives may creep in.\nQuestion #6: What would GM think of this if we were to approach them with it?\nI talked about how they would probably be thinking about the fact that their bread and butter business (traditional fuel) would be threatened, but ultimately they would need to decide whether they thought the competitors would come out with this before them, or whether they would want to be the first to market with it. I also talked about how it may take a while to implement because of operational difficulties, design etc.\nQuestion #7: Would you invest with the mad GE scientist, if he asked you to? Why or why not?\nQuestion #8: What is your 30 second elevator speech to billionaire investor Warren Buffet, who is known to have an appetite for clean energy?\nThis is a source of limitless energy. As energy demand continues to grow it becomes a more and more precious resource. Who would not want to invest in a limitless source of a precious resource?\nCommentary:\nLooking at the potential to use this perpetual motion machine technology in cars is clearly a great option and the case approach that the interviewee went through looks pretty good.\nStarting from a more generic level however I would probably tackle the question as follows:\nIf we look at the benefits of a perpetual motion machine, it is basically a source of energy. In assessing potential applications of the technology then I would ask the question “Where is there the greatest demand for energy?” or “Where is the best market for a new source of energy?”\nThis could lead to a reasonable discussion of a number of different options: energy at home, energy in industry, energy in transport. Transport makes sense as a market to drill down on this product because it is clearly such a large source of energy consumption.\nFrom a pricing perspective you may need to think about the price of the technology as against the savings that it generates. You would need to ensure there was still sufficient savings to justify consumers wishing to try a new technology. Equally it would be important that the mad scientist prices the product so that car manufacturers can implement the technology profitably.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: market sizing.\nConsulting Firm: Quintiles Consulting first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: healthcare: pharmaceutical, biotech, life sciences.\nCase Interview Question #00683: The year is 2009. Schering-Plough Corporation is a large pharmaceutical company based in Kenilworth, New Jersey, United States. Schering-Plough manufactures several pharmaceutical drugs, the most well-known of which were the allergy drugs Claritin and Clarinex, an anti-cholesterol drug Vytorin, and a brain tumor drug Temodar. The company had revenue of USD $ 18.502 billion in 2008. In November 2009, another large American pharmaceutical company Merck & Co. (NYSE: MRK) announced that it would merge with competitor Schering-Plough in a USD $41 billion deal. The new company formed will take the name of Merck & Co.\nYour client is the head of development (preclinical and clinical) at Schering-Plough. He has a declining budget and wants to re-think his portfolio. He currently uses a spreadsheet to evaluate his portfolio which contains columns for the chemical name, estimated launch date, and lead indication. Essentially, your client wants you to add a column for the current market value of the partially developed drug so that he can evaluate which ones to push through development. How do you do it?\nAdditional Information: (to be provided after relevant questions)\n\nCurrently there are 60 drugs in development with 1/3 in clinical trials, and 2/3 in pre-clinical development.\nIt takes 10 years to bring a drug from pre-clinical to launch and there is large attrition along the way.\nAssume that this is a U.S. launch only, that there is no bundling, and that each compound represents a novel therapy.\n\nPossible Solution:\nCandidate: To determine the market value of the drug, I would want to do an NPV (net present value) calculation and so the two areas I would primarily like to explore is revenue and costs. I’d like to begin with the revenue side of the equation first and begin discussing the factors that influence volume. Should I begin with a particular drug or should we talk in generalities?\nInterviewer: I’d like to focus on the thought process you would use to do the calculation and so I am not concerned about a specific drug. Generalities are fine.\nCandidate: OK. The first thing I would want to do is estimate the size of the market and consequently our market share at the time of launch. To do that I’d like to know the # of people who suffer from a particular ailment.\nInterviewer: Where would you find that?\nCandidate: You can go to all kinds of different sources like the American Cancer Society or the American Lung Association who keep track of this information. In particular, I’d take the growth rate for a given disease category over the past few years and use that to extrapolate what it would be when the drug launches to get the total number of people with the illness. Next, I’d want to find out the number of people who are generally treated for the disease.\nInterviewer: And where would you find that information?\nCandidate: Similar sources although I suspect I’d might also be able to look at market research analyst reports depending on the type of therapy being evaluated.\nInterviewer: Good\nCandidate: Next, I want to discount that number by the number of people who seek treatment using a drug vs. another procedure like surgery to get a true sense of the market. Then I would want to take into account the competitive environment.\nInterviewer: What in particular would you look for?\nCandidate: Well, I would first want to understand what competitors are on the market now and where we anticipate them being from a product lifecycle perspective when we expect to launch our therapy. In particular, I’d want to drill down on comparisons between mechanism of action, indications, and dosing requirements.\nInterviewer: What else should you look for?\nCandidate: Knowing that new drugs are always being developed, I’d want to evaluate those that are currently in the pipeline of our competitors and what we anticipate the impact of them being on the market at the time of launch. You can find this information in publications like R&D directions as well as other trade publications.\nInterviewer: Sounds good. Besides volume what else should you be thinking about?\nCandidate: Pricing. Pricing for drugs has a lot to do with demonstrated efficacy as well as whether you are the first drug in a given class to be launched. Other things that you might want to consider include convenience (dosing requirements) and other drugs used to treat the therapy even if the mechanism of action differs.\nInterviewer: Great. What about costs?\nCandidate: From a cost perspective, I’d want to consider both fixed and variable costs. This would include any new facilities that need to be built to manufacture the drug as well as the R&D and sales and marketing launch costs associated with the product.\nInterviewer: And what would you do with this information?\nCandidate: I’d determine the free cash flow number for each year and then discount that back to the current period. Additionally, since the process has high attrition, I’d also want to adjust for the probability of success at each phase.\nInterviewer: Great. Let’s say you’ve done all this and it turns out that ½ the compounds in pre-clinical development have no value. How are you going to plug the hole from a revenue perspective?\nCandidate: Any time you are considering product development there are two options – make or buy. Under the make category, we could try to expedite the development of existing pipeline drugs to address the gap but this is fairly unlikely to prove successful given the highly complex development process.\nInterviewer: What else could address the revenue considerations if you can’t expedite development?\nCandidate: You could work with your existing portfolio of marketed products to increase the amount of revenue you can get from them. This could include considering shifting them to over the counter products or evaluating other indications for the drug. However, I suspect we may already be doing this so it is unlikely to be all of the answer.\nInterviewer: Good. What else?\nCandidate: We can buy a product or a group of products to plug the hole. To do so, we should go through a similar compound valuation exercise as we did for our portfolio but also take into account synergies between our two organizations and the previous track record of the other company in launching similar projects.\nInterviewer: Sounds good. Thanks!\nComments:\nThis case is an interesting spin on the standard market sizing type of question – Rather than evaluate one market, the candidate has to outline a general process for sizing the market for a number of different drugs. Layered on top of this the candidate needs to demonstrate a good understanding of the process for deriving an NPV and the relationship between the NPV and the original market sizing exercise.\nThe candidate has given a very good answer and there are a number of positive aspects worth noting, including the following:\nBefore doing anything else, the candidate sets out a clear road map for tackling the question – “I am going to do an NPV calculation which will mean looking at revenues and costs”\nThe candidate clarifies the expectations of the interviewer – “Should we be looking at generalities or specifics?” The last thing you want to be doing in a case interview is giving a great answer that bores the interviewer because it is not the aspect of the question that they were interested in.\nThe candidate has a clear and logical approach to sizing the market for each drug. Not only are the steps sensible and meaningful but they are also readily verifiable by available data (such as American Cancer Society data on the number of patients with a particular cancer condition). It is quite common for interviewers to ask how you would go about getting the data to support a certain step in you logic so it is important to be choosing divisions where this information is likely to be available.\nThe candidate does not get bogged down when the interviewer changes the question. If you are asked a new question, like how to fill a hole in the pipeline, then develop a new framework for approaching this aspect – “there are two options to consider, make or buy”\nSimilar techniques could be applied to almost any market sizing question.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: business turnaround.\nConsulting Firm: Mars & Co first round summer internship job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: non-profit organization.\nCase Interview Question #00664: Assume that you are the new pastor (parish priest) of a rural English church in the late 19th century. Over the last three years attendance to your church has been steadily going down. Your boss has just come to town to tell you that if the downward trend continues, she will have to consider shutting down the church.\nYou have only two weeks to diagnose the problem and go to your boss with possible solutions. How would you think through what these problems might be? What are some of the possible solutions to turn around the downward trend of church attendance?\nPossible Answer:\nThere are many potential reasons why the church goers of the parish have stopped going to the church. First, I will talk about the possibility of competitive churches; secondly, I will talk about the possibility that people in the area have simply stopped going to church.\nFirst, I will talk about competing churches. There are three primary reasons why competing churches could be taking our parishioners away :\n\n better location,\n “better” (more popular) religion,\n or better services.\n\nI remember from my history classes in college that some churches were located far away from pockets of the population, and church goers often would establish churches closer to home. Also, sometimes people change what they believe or newfangled ways of thinking emerge. This could also be driving people to other churches.\nI would also want to figure out if the nearby churches are preaching different religions. There is at least a chance that these churches are offering parishioners different kind of religious viewpoint that is more attractive than the religion we have been preaching. Their rules regarding behavior, for instance, may be different from ours.\nLastly, I would want to understand the different services being offered at “competing” churches. There may be different things these other churches offer that we do not. For instance, these churches might offer childcare, adult education and job training, or singles dances. These churches may offer more personal attention and guidance from the pastors.\nNow I would like to talk about the possibility that people who live in the area around the church simply may have stopped going to church. Off the top of my head, I can think of two reasons why people may stop going to church: progress and inconvenience. As science and communication advance, people may rely less on the church to explain the world and more on scientific findings and written forms of communication such as books and newspapers. This could be happening in our parish. On the other hand, going to church may be becoming inconvenient or economically nonviable. Maybe our parishioners feel that they need to stay at home or work in the fields in order to maintain subsistence. I would want to talk to these parishioners to find out why they have stopped going to church.\nThere are many ways I could test my hypotheses. I think the most important thing is to talk to the former parishioners to ask them why they have left the church and what we would need to do to entice them back. After that, I would want to send someone (or myself) to the other churches in the area during services to understand what is being preached at these churches. To help prove if the issue is location, I would draw a map of our current and former parishioners and analyze how distance from the church affects attendance. To understand if there are other churches in the area taking away our parishioners, I would also map these new churches on my newly created map.\nOnce I understand why people are leaving, I would devise a plan to turn around the downward trend and bring the parishioners back to my church. I would want to be focused on the needs of my parish, by offering enhanced services, such as day care as well as flexibility, such as offering services at different times of the day. If distance is a factor, I may want to consider having services at different locations at different times, making our church more accessible.\nSummary Comments\nThis would be a very good answer. The candidate came up with a number of hypotheses, identified ways to test those hypotheses, and formulated an action plan to address the issues. This answer shows thoughtfulness, creativity, and structured thinking. While there may be some issues that this candidate did not identify, he/she does a good job structuring a comprehensive answer. For a 3C’s (Customer, Competitors, Company) answer to be good, a candidate does not have to address every single issue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new product, new technology.\nConsulting Firm: Siemens Management Consulting first round summer internship job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: automotive, motor vehicles.\nCase Interview Question #00665: The client Mercedes Benz is a multinational division of the German automobile manufacturer Daimler AG (FWB: DAI). Headquartered in Stuttgart, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany, the company produces a full range of luxury cars, buses, coaches, and trucks. Since its inception, Mercedes Benz had maintained a reputation for its quality and durability. Mercedes-Benz has introduced many technological and safety innovations that later became common in other vehicles. Today, Mercedes-Benz is one of the best known and established automotive brands in the world, and is also the world’s oldest automotive brand still in existence today.\nRecently, the director of marketing at Mercedes-Benz suggests a bold change to the current design of car keys. Currently, two separate keys operate the car ignition and open the doors. The Mercedes-Benz marketing director proposes an innovative design where one key operates all lock mechanisms: a single car key can open the doors, as well as start the ignition, open the glove compartment and also open the trunk (boot) of the car.\nHow do you think about whether this a good idea or not?\nSuggested Approach:\nCost-benefit analysis, NPV analysis\nPossible Solution:\nThe goal of any business including automobiles is profit throughput that can be measured by the Net Present Value (NPV)  impact of the proposed change. For the proposed change to have a positive impact on profit throughput, the change must be a net positive of change in cost structure or product demand (benefits) weighed against the investment needed to implement the change (costs).\n\nIncreased demand in this case must come from the product meeting customer needs better than that of direct competitors or substitutes.\nCustomer needs that this change might impact are simplicity, security, and cost of ownership (related to security).\nIt should also be considered if the improvement in meeting customer needs, if evident, is defensible or would be easily copied.\n\n1. Change in cost structure\nIn general, a regular 4-door car needs 6 locking mechanisms: one for the ignition, one for the trunk (boot), and 4 for the 4 doors. For security reasons, the ignition locks are more complex, usually integrated with the car’s electronic system.\nFor cost structure, the relative expense of using what is assumed to be the more complex locking mechanism of the ignition on the doors and trunk (assumed 5 locks that would be more complex) would have to be weighed against the reduced cost of developing or purchasing separate key and lock mechanisms. As most automobile manufacturers are very large, it is assumed that the simpler locking mechanism needed for the doors and trunk could be reused across many product lines or purchased from large parts suppliers who supply the industry as whole and the development cost of a separate locking mechanism would be low.\nTherefore, the change in cost structure will be driven by the relative cost difference of buying 6 complex locking mechanisms vs. 5 simple locking mechanisms and 1 complex mechanism. It is assumed that a more complex locking mechanism needed for the ignition is a primary customer need (security). Therefore, the hypothesis is that the net change of cost position is negative. It is also assumed that the market power of buying more complex locking mechanism would not significantly impact the price charged by suppliers or cost basis if developed internally. This hypothesis would be easy to check by looking at the relative cost position of the different locking mechanisms and the discount structure available for mass purchasing the various locking mechanisms.\n2. Change in product demand\nOn the demand generation side, the product would have to create a net positive in demand across the customer needs of simplicity, security, and cost of ownership.\nThe fact that the marketing director of Mercedes-Benz suggested this change hints at the fact that the intuition is that customers may demand the increased simplicity of only carrying one key. This does not seem intuitively true as the two keys are almost always carried on the same key ring so the relative improvement to simplicity is probably minimal.\nFor security, there are two factors to consider, the theft of valuables in the car and the theft of car itself. If more complex locking systems were to improve the security to valuables, then the value of going with the more complex locking system on the doors and the trunk of the car may be a positive. The assumption, however, is this is not the case as door locks are typically compromised not by picking the lock but by compromising the areas around the lock (i.e. Slim Jim). Also, security systems, which are becoming more common on cars, mute the effect of a more complex locking mechanism, as the key lock mechanism becomes the non-primary mode of defense. I do not see how moving to one key would impact the chance of theft of the entire car, as in either case the same locking mechanism would have to be beaten.\nThis also means that the cost of ownership, which could have increased if the change of car theft increased due to insurance premiums, would exhibit no affect.\nThe customer reaction to a single key mechanism could be tested through surveying or product pilots where a sample set of customers are given actual cars with one key and asked to gauge their reaction. Or larger regional pilots could be run and the change in demand affect measured.\n3. Required investment\nThe investment required to implement the change of eliminating a separate key and lock for the doors and ignition is assumed to be minimal as key locking mechanism are fairly standardized and the ignition key lock, which is probably more complex, could be transferred to the doors and trunk with minimal amount of rework of the parts assembly infrastructure for building the auto.\nThe primary investment cost would then be the cost of piloting or surveying for the increase in customer demand by implementing the change. Surveying and piloting costs can be significant, but it is assumed a cheaper survey would suffice in this case to gauge demand so investment costs would be minimal.\n4. Three final possible points to consider on demand generation.\nOne, an increase in demand is necessary but not sufficient to improve profit throughput, as the company also needs to be able to meet the new demand generated. As auto manufactures almost always have an excess of capacity, this is not an issue.\nTwo, even if this change was beneficial it could be easily copied by competitors and it is assumed that the change would not provide any lasting brand advantage in the customers mind or raise the demand of the sector as a whole. Therefore, in the long run, the cost reduction benefits would override the decision to go forward and we have already argued the affect would be negative.\nA final factor that should be considered is the assumption that the majority of cars sold in the US in the past have included two keys and the two keys have most likely generated a lot of unanticipated use that may be hard to anticipate that might cause customers to reject the change.\nSo, from a customer perspective, I would want to see the demand for this from customers to be strong and the benefits large before implementing a change. Because it does not appear the proposed change would positively impact cost position or increase demand significantly, my recommendation is against the proposed change. I recommend even against investing to gauge customer demand as the long run benefit would be in cost position and the assumption here is that the effect is negative.\nSummary Comments\nThe candidate should start with a framework, and then works through to a hypothesis and how the answer might be tested. All the customer factors or cost impact that could be considered are obviously not included. The interviewer should look for a structured presentation that arrives at a hypothesis with ideas how to test and a proposed answer.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Headquartered in San Antonio, Texas, United States, the chain is owned and operated by the Dobson family, along with 25 franchisers. As of September 2012, there are over 735 Whataburger stores across the Southern United States region.\nOne of your classmates from college just bought a Whataburger restaurant in Dallas, Texas a year ago. He just called you to complain that the Whataburger fast food burger joint he bought last year has been steadily losing money for the last 6 months. He wants to know what you think he should do about it. Where do you start? How would you help your classmate to turn around his burger restaurant?\nSuggested Approach:\nThis is an example of a profitability case where virtually no information is provided and the candidate needs to take a minute to figure out where to start probing. In this type of case, the candidate is evaluated based on the number of factors questioned up front plus the ability to logically pare down that list to get at the heart of the matter.\nSince Profits = Revenues – Costs = Price * Volume – Costs, here are some of the initial questions the candidate could ask to probe for more information:\n\nHave revenues decreased?\nHave costs increased?\nHave prices increased?\nWas the store making money 6 months ago? What has changed?\nIs there new competition?\nHas there been a major economic change in the area?\nWas there a major event like someone getting sick? Health code violation? Crime?\n\nThe answers to these questions will help to frame the extent of the required analysis.\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate: First of all, what do you mean by “losing money”? Have profits declined or is the business in the red?\nInterviewer: Profits have declined.\nCandidate: Have revenues decreased? Or, have costs increased? Or both?\nInterviewer: Revenues have decreased.\nCandidate: Well, if revenues have decreased, there are either fewer paying customers or the customers are spending less when they visit. Which is the case?\nInterviewer: While they could both play a role, in this case, there are actually fewer customers.\nCandidate: Fewer customers could be due to external factors like new competition, change in eating habits, local changes like a major business closing in the area. There are also internal factors to consider such as poor food quality, higher prices, or a major event like someone getting sick or a health code violation. Recognizing that there are likely many factors involved, is the issue primarily internal or external?\nInterviewer: The issue is external and is driven by a new competitor that opened just across the street.\nCandidate: This new competitor must be offering a better value to have made such an impact on our client’s burger joint.\n\n What is their value proposition?\n Are they offering a different type of food?\n Is it better quality?\n Is there a price disparity?\n\nInterviewer: The new competitor serves chicken dinners and appear to offer a completely different experience. How would you get a deeper understanding of their value proposition?\nCandidate: First, I would visit and learn everything that I can from what I see and experience first hand.\n\nHow is the quality of the food?\nAre the prices reasonable?\nDo they offer healthier options and more variety?\nHow is the service? How is the cleanliness?\nHow is the facility laid out?\nDo they have more parking? Easier access?\n\nOnce I get a first hand view of the competition, I would take a hard look at the Whataburger burger joint and the value proposition they are offering. The same questions would apply.\nNext, I would do some primary research including customer interviews at both locations. The focus of these interviews is to discern the differences in perception between the two locations. I would pay some customers to go to each restaurant and rate the food and experience. I would also determine how many of the customers are former Whataburger burger joint customers but now exclusively chicken customers, versus how many visit both and how many are completely new to the chicken place but would not visit the Whataburger restaurant.\nArmed with the data on what customers’ value, I would then create a set of options to evaluate. There are likely a number of areas that need improvement including new menu options, improved facility layout, better taste/quality.\n\nWhich will drive most traffic back into the restaurant fastest?\nWhich give the largest return on investment?\n\nAfter analyzing the alternatives based on the chosen criteria, I would prioritize them and develop an action plan to include timing and responsibilities.\nInterviewer: Very good. Sounds like you know the fast food restaurant business pretty well. What else would you do?\nCandidate: (At this point the case could go in several directions from leadership and project management issues, to brand marketing and promotion, to financial decisions whether to close the facility).\nSummary Comments\nThis type of case can be very intimidating since it is very broad and ill-defined up front. The interviewer may not provide much guidance or detail, increasing the stress level. When faced with a case interview of this type, the candidate should try to remain calm and methodical. Writing down the alternatives and crossing them out as they are ruled out is a good way to show their thought process. Thinking aloud is encouraged. The candidate should take a little time in the beginning to frame the issue so as not to develop a hasty hypothesis and head down the wrong path.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Trident is one of the most popular sugar-free chewing gums in the United States. It is also sold in the United Kingdom and in Canada under the same brand name. Other popular brands associated with Trident include Trident White, Trident Splash, Trident Layers, Trident Xtra Care, Trident Soft, Trident Fresh, etc.\nYou are a management consultant working for the CEO of Cadbury Adams USA. The CEO of the chewing gum manufacturing company is concerned because his most valuable brand Trident is experiencing declining profit margin. His questions to you are:\n\n What are the reasons behind Trident’s declining profitability?\n What are your suggestions for improving profitability?\n\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate if requested)\nSales for Trident brand of chewing gum have been increasing.\nIf asked about cost composition of Trident chewing gum, ask the interviewee to brainstorm potential cost buckets which may include the following: \n\n COGS (Cost of goods sold): gum, sugar, flavor, smell, color\n Labor\n SG&A (Selling, General and Administrative Expenses)\n\nRaw material cost has not changed, i.e. the unit cost is the same but total cost could be different depending on product composition. Note: This is the key to the case so don’t give the information about the unit cost to the interviewee too early in the interview. Remember to push the interviewee so that he/she comes to the conclusion all by himself/herself.\nProduct portfolio – Overall there are 2 types of Trident chewing gum products: flavored and flavorless gum. Both products are sold at the same price point.\nComposition products:\n\n Flavored gum raw material: gum, sugar, flavor, color dye\n Flavorless gum raw material: gum, sugar, color dye\n\nGum, Sugar, and Color Dye raw materials are same in size for each of the two product lines.\nPossible Answer:\nThe key focus of this profitability case is in the “product mix”. Most interviewees may be really confused when they get the information that sales have been rising and cost is constant. First, don’t guide them into the product portion right away because this is the topic that they should explore themselves. Logical buckets that the interviewees should explore are:\n\n Sales trend\n Cost trend\n Cost composition\n Product mix\n\nProfitability has declined because sales of flavored Trident gum have been increasing, which means that raw material consumption is also increasing because flavored gum requires the additional flavor component. This added with the fact that the price of flavored gum is the same as non-flavored gum, means that, essentially, costs are now rising while revenues are not.\nTo improve the profits of the gum company, the interviewee should come up with 4-5 suggestions. Some of the possible solutions are:\n\n raising price of flavored gum\n raising price for both flavored gum and flavorless gum\n sourcing cheaper flavors from other suppliers\n negotiate with existing suppliers to reduce the flavor cost\n drop the flavored gum product line\n vertical integration of flavor manufacturing company\n\nFor the answers to the second question (how to improve profits), great interviewees would present at least two type of options:\n\n short term (easy to implement, quick wins) would be to negotiate with existing suppliers or to look for other suppliers of flavor\n long term would be to vertically integrate flavor manufacturing company.\n\nWhen discussing price change, the interviewer should ask interviewees the risk regarding price increase and how they are planning to cope with it. For example, customers may buy less of flavor gums because of price increase. However, you can offer value-added product such as low-calorie flavor gum & do heavy promotional or marketing efforts to justify the price increase.\nFinally, the interviewee should make a concise conclusion or recommendation for the client.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Market\n\nThe global as well as German domestic market for auto parts is growing at 5% a year\nThere are no significant competitors in the region (Europe)\nGreatest threat comes from the U.S., Chinese, and Indian imports\nThe client is able to charge premium pricing for their national customers\n\n2. Company\n\nContinental’s manufacturing plants are operating at 100% capacity\nPlants can’t shift from producing one product to another\nCurrently the company sells products directly to customers\n\n3. Product mix\nThe interviewee should ask to understand the products and profitability of each. The interviewer should remind them that the client company sells its products in both local and international markets. Present the interviewee Exhibit 1 when asked this question (product mix and profitability of each product line).\nExhibit 1: Client’s product mix and profitability\n\n\n\nProduct\nUnits (thousand)\nAverage Price ($)\nProfit Margin\nUnit Cost ($)\n\n\nProduct A\n400\n900\n50%\n450\n\n\nProduct B\n200\n550\n40%\n330\n\n\nProduct C\n100\n400\n30%\n280\n\n\n\n4.

They should also consider developing new products in partnership with local clients and establishing new distribution channels to better serve smaller clients.\nInternationally, the client Continental should seek support from the German government to aid in the export of products. For example, create commercial partnerships at the government level. They should also consider acquiring a company in the markets they would like to enter as well as setting up distribution channels to reach these customers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Based in Goleta, California, the client Direct Relief’s network consists of 50 Medicine Banks that distribute drugs to more than 30,000 charitable Agencies, including homeless shelters and community hospitals. Medicine Banks are warehouses that store drugs received from donations and distribute them to Agencies, for example, not-for-profit hospitals.\nEach year, Direct Relief’s network secures and distributes more than 2 million boxes of drugs, that in turn are provided to more than 700,000 Americans in need annually, like working poor, elderly, homeless, etc. Drugs are sourced from big pharmaceutical companies, and also from other corporations and the public in general, for instance, liquid asset and in-kind donations.\nThe flow chart below shows the simplified network structure of our client Direct Relief.\n\n\n\nDonors –>\nClient’s network –>\nAgencies –>\nEnd users\n\n\nPharma companies\ncorporations\nmedicine drives\npublic in general\nMedicine banks\nHospitals\nshelters\nothers\nHomeless\nworking poor\nothers\n\n\n\nIn a talk with the client’s President and CEO, and the Senior Vice President (SVP) of Strategy, two main concerns were raised. Those will be the focus of our team’s activities:\n1. Although the organization has significantly increased its output over the years to End Users (in terms of the number of boxes of drugs), reported need of drugs by Hospitals and Community Service Agencies continue to escalate. Why?\n2. What could Direct Relief do to improve the situation?\nNote: This is a long introduction for a case. The interviewer or case giver should give the candidate enough time to take notes and understand the questions.\nAdditional Information: (to be given if asked by candidate)\n1. Our client Direct Relief\nMain Activities:\n\nMedicine Sourcing: Forge/maintain relationship with donors, acquire supplemental medicine using financial donations, centralize donations, distribute donations to members through its own fleet and transportation companies in-kind donations.\nPublic Education and Advocacy: Research and studies, lobbying, public relations\n\nDonation Trends:\n\nThe number of boxes of drugs donated to Direct Relief has been increasing for the last 5 years with a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 7.2%\nLiquid asset donations and In-Kind donations (services such as transportation) have also been increasing with a CAGR of 10.1% in the same period\nGovernment programs dedicated to sourcing medicine to the needy have also increased their budget with a CAGR of 6.7%\n\nDemand Trends:\n\nTotal need for medicine to the needy has been growing at the rate of GDP for the last years.\n\n2. Medicine Banks\n\nMedicine Banks are non-profit organizations that centralize and distribute drugs to Agencies.\nThose Medicine Banks are members of Direct Relief’s network, but Direct Relief does not control them because they are separate non-profit organizations.\nDirect Relief’s network currently has one Medicine Bank in each of the 50 USA states.\nAlthough Direct Relief is responsible for a significant portion of the total volume of drugs distributed by Medicine Banks, governmental programs and local donations also significant sources (65% and 25% respectively).\n\n3. End-Users\nRecently (Year 2006) the client Direct Relief surveyed end-users’ demographics for the second time in its history (first survey was in 2001). Some of the results are the following (show Exhibits 1-3):\nExhibit 1. End-User Household Income\n\nExhibit 2. End-User Age\n\nExhibit 3. End-User Education\n\n\n (Note: Do not volunteer this information unless the candidate asks about the change in demographics of End-Users) In interviews with Agencies, it was discovered that processes to evaluate End-User eligibility to free medicines were banished due to the additional operational complexities that were perceived by many as unnecessary.\nIt was also verified that some hospitals were using medicine sourced by Direct Relief’s network to fill regular inventory gaps.\n\n4. Food Sourcing and Geographic Data\nCriteria for Allocation of Medicine to Medicine Banks\n\nThe current criteria to allocate drugs to Medicine Banks (and consequently states) is based on the number of boxes of drugs distributed to end-users in the previous month by that state/Medicine Bank\n\nExhibit 4. Top and Bottom 10 states by drugs sourced by the client (adjusted to eliminate differences in state population sizes)\n\n\n\nTop 10 States\nBottom 10 States\n\n\nNY\nNV\n\n\nNC\nWI\n\n\nIL\nUT\n\n\nFL\nPA\n\n\nAK\nCO\n\n\nAZ\nMO\n\n\nKS\nND\n\n\nMS\nVT\n\n\nSD\nTX\n\n\nCA\nOH\n\n\n\nExhibit 5. Need of Medicine by State\n\nPrompt: If the candidate does not draw any conclusion from this chart, ask him/her which quadrant should receive more attention from Direct Relief.\nPossible Answer:\nThe client Direct Relief’s drug allocation method to Medicine Banks is not adequate, as evidenced by the information that states in most need are also in many cases members of the bottom 10 states in terms of boxes of drugs received from Direct Relief.\nThe candidate might assume that since the top 10 states are performing well and the bottom 10 states are not, then Direct Relief’s donations are tilting the balance and influencing how states fare. That concept can be dismissed once the candidate finds out that Direct Relief sources only 10% of all donations to medicine banks.\nA suggested allocation method would be to evaluate the state’s total demand for drugs and its trend, and supply according to that need.\nAlso, since agencies eliminated end-user screening processes, more medicine is being directed to end-users who don’t need that support (which can be seen in the change in end-user demographics)\nA new screening process should be instituted to guarantee that agencies are not overburden with the new process, thus directing drugs to the needy\nFinally, the client Direct Relief should implement inspections at hospitals to make sure that source medicine is not being used to fill regular inventory gaps and impose sanctions to hospitals that adopt such practice.\nAn outstanding candidate would evaluate that since Direct Relief is only responsible for 10% of donations to medicine banks, Direct Relief should focus in public education and advocacy targeting to increase donations made by the general public and to increase funds from government programs. Lobbying could play a much larger role and should be one of the uses of liquid assets available to Direct Relief.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

We were hired by International Business Machines Corporation (IBM, NYSE: IBM) to support them with their portfolio strategy. Headquartered in Armonk, New York, United States, IBM manufactures and markets computer hardware and software, and offers infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in areas ranging from mainframe computers to nanotechnology.\nCurrently (in year 2004) they have 10 lines of business, including personal computers, servers, mainframe computers, software, networking equipment, IT services, consulting services, etc. We are evaluating to understand which businesses our client should divest from, and what should be the strategy for the ones they keep. Specifically, our team is responsible for analyzing IBM’s personal computers (PC) division. Should our client IBM invest or divest on its PC division?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate upon request)\n1. PC Market Environment (in 2004)\n\nMarket growth trends\n\n Average 4% per year sales growth\n 15% per year for notebook/laptops\n -5% per year for desktop PCs\n\n\nFragmented Industry: 10+ players (Dell, HP, IBM, Acer, Fujitsu, Toshiba, Lenovo, NEC, Apple, Sony, etc)\nMarket Shares and Growth Trends\n\n Competitor A (Dell): ~20% and slowly growing\n Competitor B (HP): ~13% and slowly growing\n Our client (IBM): 5% and slowly declining\n Other competitors: ~60%\n\n\n\n2. Client Company\n\nOur client IBM has a very strong brand that is synonym of quality and state of the art technology, but so far its brand did not translate into the ability to charge a price premium on its products\nManufacturing is currently 95% based on pre-configured systems.\n\n Our client IBM has not developed the capability to deliver customized systems in an adequate time frame for end users\n Our client IBM sells PCs through its website, but online sales are negligible\n\n\nOur client IBM has its own sales force to cater to corporate customers, but penetration for corporate customers is very low and this segment is not profitable for our client at this point.\nThe Personal Computers (PC) division has no specific strategic importance to our client IBM.\n\n3. Revenues and Costs\nImportant Notes to Interivewer\n\n Reveal only information that the candidate asks for.\n As soon as the candidate has information on Average Price, Gross Margins, Market Shares and Number of Units sold by our client, you should ask him/her to calculate COGS (cost of goods sold) and the number of units sold by Competitors A Dell, Competitor B HP, and our client IBM – only COGS (Laptops and Desktops).\n In summary, table cells in blank should be calculated by the candidate\n\n\n\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\n\nDesktops\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Price\nGross Margins\nCOGS\nUnits\nAverage Price\nGross Margins\nCOGS\nUnits\n\n\nCompetitor A Dell\n$1,000\n9%\n$910\n8.0M Units/year\n$600\n5%\n$570\n4.0M Units/year\n\n\nCompetitor B HP\n$1,500\n15%\n$1,275\n5.2M Units/year\n$900\n10%\n$810\n2.6M Units/year\n\n\nOur client IBM\n$1,900\n20%\n$1,520\n2.0M Units/year\n$1,200\n10%\n$1,080\n1.0M Units/year\n\n\n\n4. Competitors\nA. Competitor Dell\n\n Competitor Dell’s core business is personal computers\n Dell uses a direct model for consumers and SME, and has a large and respected sales force for corporate clients\n Dell focuses on made-to-order model, having inventory turns 3x our client IBM’s and 2x Competitor B HP’s, and is renowned for its operational effectiveness\n Due to bargaining power with suppliers and its made-to-order model, Dell has negative working capital\n Despite its lower gross margin percentages, Dell still has EBITDA margins 2x industry average (when the industry average includes Dell).\n The industry’s average EBITDA margins not including Dell is negative.\n\nB. Competitor HP\n\n Competitor HP’s core business includes personal computers, servers, networking equipment and IT services\n HP sells through big block retailers to consumers, and through its own sales force for corporate clients\n HP sells mostly pre-configured systems, but also delivers made-to-order computers\n HP has above market average EBITDA margins and inventory turns\n\n5. Customers\nNote: provide to candidate only characteristics explicitly asked for.\n\n\n\n\nConsumer (30% of the laptops market)\nCorporate (70% of the laptops market)\n\n\nPreferred Channel\nDirect service or retail\nSpecialized sales force\n\n\nCompetitive Features\nPrice, customization options\nPrice, reliability, sales force/tech support quality\n\n\nPrice Sensitivity\nHigh\nMedium-High\n\n\nPerception of client’s products\nExpensive, sleek, small level of customization, brand inspires quality (although consumers are not sure if computers are of good quality)\nExpensive, not appropriate for corporate travel due to less than stellar build quality, reliability considered to be low because of “sleek look”, inadequate tech support and sales force\n\n\nPerception of Competitor Dell’s products\nAffordable, fair quality and reliability, easy to order\nAffordable, decent quality, good sales force and excellent tech support\n\n\nPerception of Competitor HP’s products\nExpensive, very robust and reliable, decent variety of system configurations, “boxy” looking\nExpensive, very robust and reliable, excellent sales force and tech support\n\n\n\nPossible Answer:\nOur client IBM is losing share in a market where strong players such as Competitor Dell are thriving through the use of a direct sales model (and high customization level) for consumers, and strong sales force and tech support for corporate customers.\nNot considering Competitor Dell, the PC industry has negative average EBITDA margin, evidencing a highly competitive environment.\nAlthough our client IBM has a distinctive brand that many times is a synonym of quality and state of the art technology, it was not possible to realize any price premium without compromising market share.\nOur client IBM’s COGS is significantly higher than Competitors Dell and HP, possibly due to economies of scale. Those competitors are also specialized on IT and personal computers, and have reached a high level of operational effectiveness (especially Competitor Dell), as evidenced by their higher inventory turns and higher EBITDA margins.\nOur client IBM also is not aligned with customer needs for both consumers and corporate clients, and would have to improve significantly its tech support and sales force size and effectiveness. Investing in improving its sales force size and effectiveness would lead to high capital investments and would take a long time to ramp up on the learning curve.\nTherefore, our client IBM should divest from its personal computers division since it seems unlikely that it will be able to compete effectively in that market and the overall market attractiveness is low.\nAn outstanding candidate would also consider the implications to our client IBM’s brand, potential companies that would acquire the division, and other alternatives to remain in the PC market such as alliances, outsourcing production, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

It is a leading company in the design and manufacturing of packaging for commercial products. GP has created the display packaging for a wide range of popular consumer goods, particularly beverages and packaged food.\nOur client Graphic Packaging manufactures paperboard beverage cartons for major bottlers like Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo (12 bottle or can packs, 24 packs, etc).

Gross Margin: our client’s gross margin is significantly lower than competitors\n\n No bundling or “high-low” pricing appears to be occurring (this product is not a loss leader for some other product)\n The industry appears to be at equilibrium – there are no pricing games in progress, predatory pricing, etc.\n\n2.

If the interview is within 3 minutes of the end and the candidate still hasn’t started to wrap up, ask him/her: “The project sponsor is asking if we’ve found the problem. What can we tell her?”\nPossible Answer:\nWe have identified a way to increase operating margin from 0% to 15%.\n\nWe should target a new paper thickness of 30 or better\nThis will reduce our paper cost from $40 per thousand cartons to $30 per thousand cartons\nTotal cost per thousand cartons will be reduced from $65 to $55\nOperating margin will be increased from $0 to $10, or from 0% margin to $10 / $65 = ~15% margin\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new business.\nConsulting Firm: McKinsey & Company first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: non-profit organization; sports, leisure & recreation.\nCase Interview Question #00677: Our client Great Outdoors is a small not-for-profit organization near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It provides outdoor experiences including adventure therapy and wilderness therapy (the use of wilderness expeditions for the purpose of therapeutic intervention) to help pre-teen and young adolescents. The nonprofit organization offers a range of different types of wilderness therapy programs, with a range of models and approaches.\nOriginally, Great Outdoors is primarily concerned with providing 10-15 day primitive camping and hiking trips for troubled teenagers. However, recently a friend of one of Great Outdoors’s founders asked the group to provide a shorter program for corporate executives, which was a great success in the first few iterations. The management of Great Outdoors has retained your consulting firm to make a recommendation on whether to expand Great Outdoors to create a full-fledged executive program. What would you recommend?\nNote to Interviewer:\nRead the Additional Information well before you give the case. Note that this case requires you (the interviewer or case giver) to drive key points in the discussion. Allow the candidate to formulate a plan and then prompt him/her to consider each of the topics listed below if the interviewee does not think of them themselves.\nQuestion #1: What issues should you consider?\nPossible Answer:\nMany different frameworks can work here as long as they drive to the main question and clearly account for the not-for-profit nature of the company. This case is really designed to test candidate flexibility since most people haven’t practiced cases on nonprofits. A candidate who approaches the question as a standard business case without acknowledging that stakeholders are concerned with mission, emotional benefits, philanthropy, etc. will not succeed because they have not shown flexibility or good listening skills.\nIssues that should appear in the candidate’s framework\n\nEconomics of the two programs (don’t let them drive this yet – we’ll get to it later)\nOperational issues\n\n Major constraints on capacity (e.g. guide availability, permits, geographic reach, scheduling, etc.)\n Possible synergies from the two programs (e.g., offsetting seasonality of demand, economies of scale)\n Underutilized fixed costs (lots of idle time for guides or gear that could be utilized at no marginal cost)\n\n\nMission: What is Great Outdoors’ purpose? What is at risk from expanding?\n\n Are there constraints on engaging in commercial activity based on endowment or foundation restrictions?\n Will the current employees revolt if “profit” becomes a factor?\n Does organizational passion become compromised by “selling out”?\n Credibility issues by straddling profit/nonprofit worlds\n\n\nCompetitive situation\n\nQuestion #2: Does expanding the executive program make sense economically? Provide the following Additional Information if the candidate asks for it clearly and directly.\nAdditional Information:\nCompetitors and Market Size – we do not have any specific information but believe we can sell out our capacity at current prices (no demand constraints). Competitors are very fragmented.\nMission/Charter restrictions – we are not aware of any rules stipulating what the organization can or can’t do – we don’t anticipate losing funding based on a decision here\nCosts and revenues – Do not show this table directly to the interviewee; just share the numbers in a conversational way. They should create something similar in their notes. The candidate is expected to calculate the bold rows (Revenue, Subtotal, Subtotal, Total Margin)\nRevenue and Expenses Per Trip\n\n\n\n\nExecutive\nNonprofit\n\n\n# students per trip\n15\n8\n\n\nProgram fee per student\n$2,000\n$800\n\n\nRevenue\n15 * $2,000 = $30,000\n8 * $800 = $6,400\n\n\nDays per trip\n4\n11\n\n\nCosts (food, equipment, insurance, etc) per student per day\n$200\n$125\n\n\nSubtotal\n$200 * 4 * 15 = $12,000\n$125 * 11 * 8 = $11,000\n\n\n# of guides\n4\n2\n\n\nCost per guide per day\n$200\n$150\n\n\nSubtotal\n$200 * 4 * 4 = $3,200\n$150 * 2 * 11 = $3,300\n\n\nTotal Margin\n$30,000 – $12,000 – $3,200 = $14,800\n$6,400 – $11,000 – $3,300 = -$7,900\n\n\n\nQuestion #3: At this point what is a preliminary recommendation?\nPossible Answer:\nClearly the economics of the executive program are compelling. However it’s critical to think about whether it is practical for the nonprofit organization to expand into this very profitable activity.\nQuestion #4: What would concern you about Great Outdoors starting a regular executive offering?\nPossible Answer:\nA good candidate should touch on these following factors:\n\nCompetitor response – Competitors are very fragmented (the candidate should realize this means a response is not likely)\nCost/Operational Savings – May be slight\nLoss of nonprofit status for fundraising, foundation charter restrictions, etc. – The company’s lawyers believe this won’t be an issue\nOrganizational\n\n People who are motivated to help out a non-profit may be less willing to help if they feel that the organization has “sold out” to high-paying corporate customers\n Do corporate customers require different types of guides?\n\n\n\nQuestion #5: How would you deal with employees, donors, and other supporters who feel that working with corporate executives conflicts with Great Outdoors, an nonprofit organization’s core values? Will working with profitable executive programs mean that traditional programs are compromised?\nPossible Answer:\nThe candidate can brainstorm many different answers as long as they make sense. Some possibilities include:\n\nSell the idea that every corporate program funds two traditional programs; by doing more corporate ventures we can reach more kids\nExecutive programs are basically advertising Great Outdoors to a large pool of donor money; running exec programs is a good way to drive awareness among potential mentors, philanthropists, clients, etc.\nFor some employees that are environmentally driven (think about the type of person that chooses to work as a guide) getting executives out to nature helps promote conservation and environmentalism.\n\nQuestion #6: What is your final recommendation?\nPossible Answer:\nThis is a fairly open ended case that doesn’t “crack” with any one insight; it is about assessing the way the interviewee approaches the process and how thoughtful they are about each issue.\nGood Answer: The organization should expand executive programs as there appears to be unsatisfied demand and it creates other benefits – demand balancing, scale benefits, etc. However communicating this decision to stakeholders correctly is critical to avoid alienating core supporters.\nFailing answer: Any answer that focuses only on the business and economic issues of the case without spending a considerable amount of time addressing the ideological and non-economic motives of nonprofit operators.\nNote:\nThis case was given by McKinsey in first-round interviews and is a “command and control” type of case. In this style of case, the interviewer initially allows the candidate to drive the case and explore possible routes to a solution. However, once the candidate has laid out a plan, the interviewer takes control and asks the candidate to solve a few specific problems before coming to the final conclusion.\nWhen giving this case, the interviewer should allow for some initial planning and brainstorming by the candidate, but then firmly take control of each of the “modules” described below.\nTry to move the candidate along through each of them, since in the actual interview only those candidates that complete all of the sections will be considered to have done well. This case tests mental horsepower and the ability to move to conclusions quickly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: increase sale/revenue.\nConsulting Firm: Boston Consulting Group (BCG) first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: telecommunications & network.\nCase Interview Question #00678: Our client Optical Fiber Solutions (OFS) manufactures and markets leading-edge fusion splicers, optical fiber, optical cable, fiber to the home (FTTX), connectivity and optical components. Headquartered in Norcross in the outskirts of Atlanta, Georgia, USA, Optical Fiber Solutions is a wholly owned subsidiary of Japanese telecom and electric company Furukawa Electric Co.\nAn optical fiber is a flexible, transparent fiber made of glass (silica), slightly thicker than a human hair. It can function as a waveguide, or “light pipe”, to transmit light between the two ends of the fiber. Optical fibre has volume advantages to copper wire and is mainly used by the telecom, cable and mobile phone industries. It’s made in glass strands and rolled onto 25 km spools.\nOur client Optical Fiber Solutions’ customers (who are generally major Telecoms networks like AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon) would buy a huge quantity, bundle it up, dig a trench and put the bundle of optical fibres in the ground.\nRecently, the client has seen a 50% decline in revenues, and has recently brought in a new CEO. The new CEO of OFS would like you to help address three questions:\n\nWhy did revenues drop 50% in one year?\nCan he expect an improvement, and if so in what timeframe?\nHow does our company compare to our competitors?\n\nAdditional Information: (to be provided after relevant questions)\n\nOptical fibre is similar to a commodity, so consumers do not purchase by brand.\nOur client OFS’s pricing is in line with competition.\nThere has been no significant change in supply from the company’s perspective.\nThere are no direct substitutes and no regulation changes during this period.\nThe “usage” of the optical fibres, for voice, data and internet, has actually doubled each year (meaning you would think you’d actually need twice as much each year).\nOur client’s customers (telecom companies) are asking for less.\nThere has been no major change in customer (telecom companies)’s industry. Our client even spread across industries for product sales.\nCurrent usage of optical fibre is 5 T/second, but capacity is 100 T/second.\n\nSuggested Approach:\n3C’s framework: Company, Competitors, Custoers.\nThe key to solving this case question is understanding what is actually going on in the industry. To get to the heart of this issue you could ask:\nClearly our client OFS has lost a significant portion of their revenue. To understand why there are three key things I would want to examine.\nFirst, what has changed about our Client Company – we haven’t heard of any major reason why things would be going wrong internally but some of the things that I would want to look at are: Have they lost key sales personnel with good customer relationships? Have they lost their good reputation because of some incident or accident etc? Have there been perceived quality problems? Etc\nSecond, I would want to look at our key Competitors – Are they offering a better product? (probably not if the industry is commoditized) Are they selling at a lower price? Are they offering better service/delivery times etc? Are there now more competitors? Are our competitors better placed geographically to meet the needs of our customers? Are their some competitors that are doing better than us? If so how do they differ from us? Are they bigger and leveraging their scale, etc?\nThird, I would want to look at the needs of our Customers and whether these have changed. – If there is nothing wrong with our product (Client) and our Competitors haven’t suddenly got better then the downturn in sales must have something to do with the needs of our Customers. What is their current usage? What is their current capacity? What is their anticipated usage? What are their purchasing patterns relative to capacity? etc\nThis structure (3C’s) should drive you to identify the key issue. The way the facts are presented it looks like most of the questions on Client and Competitors will yield little return and the richest part of the discussion will focus around Customer needs. This should provide the opportunity to discover all of the facts about the growth in demand and the capacity constraint currently in place. It could also lead to understanding the “lumpy” nature of these capital purchases.\nThis discussion should also draw out enough information to answer the follow up question on how our client compares to its competitors.\nPossible Solution:\nQuestion #1: Why did revenues drop 50% in one year?\nI determined the problem was that because it is such an effort and expense to dig the trenches to put the fibre bundles in, the customer does it as infrequently as possible which leads to overcapacity.\nQuestion #2: Can the CEO expect an improvement? If so, when?\nI found out that they buy a year in advance of needing it. Since usage doubled yearly, I worked out that customers would reach capacity in 3.5 years, and therefore we would be impacted for 2.5 years.\nQuestion #3: The CEO wants a benchmark slide with how we compare to our competitors: what would be the main items you’d want to see on that slide?\nI asked for Market Share (leader), Cost (lowest cost), People (no advantage), Customer Base (no advantage), Product (no real advantage), and Balance Sheet (highest)\nQuestion #4: The CEO asked if we could weather the storm or if we were in trouble.\nI said if we had a pretty healthy financial situation, we could weather the storm for 2.5 years but that it would be worthwhile looking for other ways to diversify since this would be a cyclic problem.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: business turnaround; merger and acquisition (M&A).\nConsulting Firm: Cognizant Business Consulting (CBC) first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: forestry, paper products.\nCase Interview Question #00647: The client is the CEO of Georgia-Pacific LLC, an American pulp and paper company based in Atlanta, Georgia. The company is one of the world’s leading manufacturers and distributors of tissue, pulp, paper, toilet and paper towel dispensers, packaging paper, building products and related chemicals. As of Fall 2010, the Georgia-Pacific company employed more than 40,000 people at more than 300 locations in North America, South America and Europe. It is an independently operated and managed company of multinational conglomerate Koch Industries.\nIn the US, the paper industry generally has over-capacity. Recently the industry has also seen a trend of consolidation. This year, the client Georgia-Pacific paper company has seen 2 consecutive losing quarters. Your consulting team has been hired by the CEO of Georgia-Pacific to turn around his company. What should the company do?\nQuestion #1: What factors would you consider in turning around the paper company?\nPossible Solution:\nA good structure will include the following elements (3C’s framework).\n1. Company\n\n What are the products the client is currently selling?\n How do their products fit into the overall market?\n What is the value chain for our client and where is the problem that causes the loss in profitability?\n\n2. Market for the products\n\n What is the size of the overall market?\n Are there any overall growth/shrinkage of the market?\n\n3. Competition\n\n Fragmented market or big competitors dominate?\n What are the competitions doing currently?\n Substitutes for the products in the market\n\n4. Customers\n\n Who are the client’s customers?\n What are the need of these customers?\n How does our client meet customers’ needs?\n\nQuestion #2: Ask the candidate to look at the company’s profitability and assess how much we need to increase revenues or decrease costs to become profitable.\nAdditional Information provided upon request:\n1. Products:\n\n Book paper, considered their core product – 90% of the revenues\n Carbonless paper, used in credit card machines – 10% of the revenues\n The cost to change manufacturing lines from one product to another is minimal\n\n2. Industry:\n\n Book paper market is stagnant, the client is #2 in market, and there are 3 main players\n Carbonless paper market is shrinking, but profits are slightly rising, the client is #5 in market, and there are many players\n\n3. Customers:\n\n Book paper customers are publishers\n Carbonless paper customers are large distributors\n\n4. Company:\n\n The client currently has 2 plants in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania\n\nPossible Answer:\nLooking at the revenues coming from the two products and the situation in their respective markets, there appears to be little opportunity for improvement in revenues. Although the profit in carbonless paper is higher, the market is shrinking.\nIn order to look at the cost side I would like to better understand the value chain for the products.\nProcurement -> Manufacturing -> Distribution -> Sales and Marketing\nAdditional Information provided upon request:\n\nProcurement: Inputs are raw materials (pulp) and chemicals; the prices of both are generally rising\nManufacturing: The client’s 2 plants are generally old and unsophisticated\nDistribution: Currently, the client uses 45% rail and 55% trucking; the price of rail is on average 50% lower; trucks are typically running ~40% empty\nSales and Marketing: the client differentiates on their service level, e.g. next day delivery, 2nd day to west coast, etc; competitors differentiate on brightness and price of paper\n\nNote: The candidate should notice that the client has little room to move on the purchase of commodities; upon further questioning, the candidate should be told that the service level is important to their customers; a manufacturing discussion is important, but should be saved for the next part. Therefore, the important point here is the wasted money in distribution.\nBased on these additional information it seems there is a lot of waste in their cost structure and there are lots of ways to decrease costs:\n\nPurchasing the raw materials at lower costs (new contracts / consolidate suppliers for more buying power, etc)\nNew technology could help them reduce the cost of manufacturing paper\nDistribution seems to be the quickest win that can provide great savings by moving from trucking to rail and/or by making sure that trucks run at full capacity.\n\nQuestion #3: The CEO of Georgia-Pacific paper company notifies you that he is considering purchasing up to 3 additional paper mills\n\nEast Coast Mill: has 2 manufacturing lines that are older technology, the mill comes with its own distribution center\nMid-West Mill: has 4 manufacturing lines that are state of the art, and produces its own pulp\nWest Coast Mill: similar to East Coast Mill\n\nHow does this affect the analysis? The candidate should provide a final recommendation to the client.\nAdditional Information provided upon request:\n\nPrices for each paper mill:\n\n East Coast Mill $70 million\n Mid-West Mill $80 million\n West Coast Mill $60 million\n\n\nTo update the firm’s Wisconsin mill to the technology level of the Mid-West mill will cost $120 million\nThe Mid-West mill has easy access to rail and truck transportation\nThe client’s current Wisconsin plant has rail access only with Wisconsin Central, essentially a monopoly that charges high freight rates\n75% of the firm’s customers lie east of the Mississippi\n\nPossible Answers:\nGood answers:\nAt this point, it should be clear to the candidate that the firm’s major problems lie on the cost side and that the two largest buckets that need to be addressed are raw materials and distribution cost; plant efficiency is also a tertiary issue.\nA good candidate will suggest purchasing at a minimum the Mid-West plant for the distribution advantage and possibly the East Coast plant because of the distribution center. The West Coast mill is a red herring.\nBetter answers:\n\nBetter answers would recommend purchasing the Mid-West plant and closing down the current Wisconsin plant since over-capacity is an issue\n\n This enables more efficient production and better access to cheaper distribution\n\n\nThe firm should set up distribution centers to allow slower & cheaper distribution by rail but at the same time enable the maintenance of the high service level that customers require\n\n Any distribution centers should be geographically located near high concentrations of customers; since the plants will be in the Mid-West & Pennsylvania, this would likely be in the South\n\n\nThe East Coast plant should not be purchased since the real attractive piece is the distribution center, not the plant itself, and it is much cheaper to set up distribution centers than spend $70 million on purchasing a new plant.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

(NYSE: CC) is an American retailer of electronics headquartered in Richmond, Virginia. It sells all kinds of consumer electronics, personal computers, entertainment software, and large home appliances. The company opened its first store in the 1970s, pioneering the electronics superstore format in the 1990s. Currently there are 375 Circuit City Superstores nationwide located in all major cities across the US.\nCircuit City has a healthy profit margin and represents a major player in the electronics retail market. At the time of its peak, Circuit City was the second largest US electronics retailer, after Best Buy (NYSE: BBY). Recently, the CEO of Circuit City has hired Corporate Executive Board (CEB) to help them grow even quicker.\nRecently they opened a number of smaller conceptual stores. These stores are less profitable than the regular Superstores, which range in size from 15,000 to 45,000 square feet (1,400 to 4,000 square meters). We have the task to help them grow aggressively while maintaining the same profitability. How would you go about this case?\nQuestion #1: What are some of the key areas to investigate in order to determine why the new stores are not profitable?\nPossible Answer:\nA good answer will identify the followings areas:\n1. Revenues\n\n Type of products sold in these stores\n Product assortment\n Number of customers entering these stores\n Type of customers( income levels, family status, etc) and how the assortment in the stores meets their needs\n\n2. Costs\n\n Costs related to the volume sold (mainly fixed costs)\n Labor costs; maybe higher trained personnel\n Distribution costs( from suppliers to the store)\n\n3. Competition\n\n What is the presence of competition in the area\n What kind of stores the competition has in the area\n\n4. Other Factors\n\n Number of hours open\n Type of stores\n Location of the stores\n What are the customer’s needs and how our client manages to met them\n\nQuestion #2: How many new stores do they need to open in order to secure a 20% market share in 5 years?\nAdditional Information to be provided upon request:\n\nCurrent consumer electronics retail Market Size = $300 billion\nClient’s current Market Share = 10%\nElectronics retail Market Size in 5 years = $400 billion\nAggressive growth would mean achieving 20% market share in the next 5 years.\n\nPossible Solution:\nFor simplicity of the calculation, the candidate should take into account that the current stores are all of the same revenue size and the future ones will have the same average revenues; the candidate should realize that this calculation would be different if that was not being considered.\nCurrent state:\n\nMarket Size = $300 billion\nMarket Share = 10%\nRevenue = 10% * $300 = $30 billion\nRevenue per store = $30 billion / 375 = $80 million\n\nIn 5 years:\n\nMarket Size = $400 billion\nMarket Share = 20%\nRevenue = 20% * $400 = $80 billion\nGrowth needed in revenues = $80 – $30 = $50 billion\nNumber of new stores needed = $50 billion / $80 million = 625 (but new stores will be only specialized that have lower revenue)\n\nQuestion #3: Is their current growth strategy a successful one?\nPossible Answer:\nA good candidate will realize that their current growth strategy (to open 625 new stores in 5 years) is not feasible (they opened their first store in the 1970s, and currently they only have 375 stores from 1970 to present – 40 years).\nQuestion #4: How can they do to achieve their growth/market share objectives?\nPossible Solution:\n\nIncrease sales of existing superstores.\nOpen only the old type of superstores\nChoose locations with a specific type of inhabitants (based on income, family status, hobbies, etc)\nIntroduce new products and use the customer database to sell them\nImplement marketing campaigns, loyalty cards, etc\nMake contracts with schools, institutions, hotels, companies, etc\nBecome a distributor for small electronics stores\nRaise prices on non price-sensitive electronics products\nAcquire/merge with a competitor\nGet into other channels like online sales, E-commerce, door to door sales, etc\nStart selling services such as repairs, installations, etc\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

With its headquarter located in Paradise, Nevada, Caesars is one of the largest gaming companies in the world, with annual revenues of USD $8.9 billion in fiscal year 2010.\nCaesars Entertainment Corporation currently owns four casinos in Atlantic City: Bally’s Atlantic City, Caesars Atlantic City, Harrah’s Atlantic City, and Showboat Atlantic City. Recently, one of Caesars’ major competitors Trump Entertainment Resorts, Inc. is contemplating opening up a rival casino in nearby Philadelphia.\nThe CEO of Caesars Entertainment has hired Simon Kucher & Partners to assess the ramifications of competitor Trump Entertainment opening a casino in Philadelphia. Also, what are Caesars Entertainment’s strategic options to respond?\nQuestion #1: What are the ramifications for existing revenue if a casino opens in Philadelphia?\nAdditional Information:\n\nCurrently there are no casinos in Philadelphia. There are many competing casinos in Atlantic City but they are not relevant because it is a mature market.\nAtlantic City has a 25% tax on gambling revenue. Philadelphia has a 50% tax on gambling revenues.\n\nPossible Answer:\nIn order to assess the implications of a new casino in Philadelphia on Caesars Entertainment we need to understand the following:\n1. Revenues\n\n What are the revenues of the client Caesars Entertainment?\n Where do their revenues come from (type of services, etc)?\n\n2. Geographic Location\n\n Where is Philadelphia located in relation to Atlantic City?\n Where are the revenues from Atlantic City coming from geographically?\n\n3. Customers\n\n Who are the customers of Caesars Entertainment and how the customers may consider going to competition in Philadelphia?\n How many customers do they have now and how many they can lose to competitions?\n\nAdditional Information: (to be provided only on request)\n\nCaesars Entertainment’s revenues from the 4 casinos in Atlantic City are $1.2 Billion\nThe majority of revenues come from 4 cities: Atlantic City, Philadelphia, Jersey City, New York City (show slide)\nJersey City and New York City are nearby, approximately 1 hour from Atlantic City. They are both ~2 hour from Philadelphia. Philadelphia is ~1 hour from Atlantic City. There are no casinos in New York City or Jersey City due to city regulations.\nCustomer base is 1.8 million per year (Customer Segmentation is a key insight).\n\nNote: do not let the candidate become bogged down into calculating costs and estimating profits.\nCustomer Segmentation Exhibits to be given upon request:\nA. Figure 1. Geographic segmentation of Caesars Entertainment’s customers, based on revenue distribution among the four cities (New York City, Atlantic City, Jersey City, Philadelphia)\n\nB. Table 1. Psychographic segmentation of Caesars Entertainment’s customers, based on customer type\n\n\n\nCustomer Type\n% of Revenue\nRevenue ($MM)\nCustomers (thousands)\nRevenue / Customer\n\n\nPlug & Chug\n40%\n480\n1,000\n480\n\n\nVacationers\n50%\n600\n600\n1,000\n\n\nExperiencers\n10%\n120\n200\n600\n\n\n\n\nPlug and Chuggers: Hard Core gamblers who only want to gamble and care most about convenience (assume casino payouts are identical across the board)\nVacationers: want to “get away” and leave the area for a week or weekend\nExperiencers: want to live the casino experience (lights, shows, action, etc) and are interested in the casino itself and what it has to offer\n\nOther Additional Information given upon request:\n\nAll customers can be considered evenly distributed across the four cities\nConversion information: (before giving this information ask the candidate for his/her opinions)\n\n Philadelphia Plug and Chuggers will shun Atlantic City for the new, closer casino (100% conversion)\n Philadelphia Vacationers want to get away so would not go to the Philadelphia casino (0% conversion)\n Philadelphia Experiencers may or may not go somewhere else – a range of answers is accepted but assume 50% for the calculations (50% conversion)\n\n\nImportant: assume that the additional drive time from New York City or Jersey City to Philadelphia will deter any significant number of those customers from defecting to Philadelphia.\n\nCalculations and Insights:\nRevenue Lost = Current Revenue * Philadelphia Revenue Share * Conversion Rate\n\n\n\nCustomer Type\nRevenue ($MM)\n% of revenues from Philadelphia\n% lost to new casino\nTotal revenue lost ($MM)\n\n\nPlug & Chug\n480\n25%\n100%\n480 * 25% * 100% = 120\n\n\nVacationers\n600\n25%\n0\n0\n\n\nExperiencers\n120\n25%\n50%\n120 * 25% * 50% = 15\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n\n120 + 15 = 135\n\n\n\nTherefore, a competitor’s casino in Philadelphia will reduce the client’s overall revenues by $135 million.\nHowever, if Caesars Entertainment decides to build their own casino in Philadelphia, it will steel share from itself and lose some revenue due to the tax rate difference in Atlantic City and in Philadelphia. Since Atlantic City has a 25% tax on gambling revenue and Philadelphia has a 50% tax on gambling revenues, the revenues lost to taxes would be: $135 million * (50% – 25%) = $33.75 million.\nAt this point, the candidate should realize that it is better for Caesars Entertainment to lose $33.75 million than $135 million.\nQuestion #2: What are the client Caesars Entertainment’s options?\nPossible Solution:\nFrom the above analysis, the client Caesars Entertainment could either\n\n Do nothing, or\n Open a casino in Philadelphia\n\nThe candidate should understand that it is more desirable to cannibalize within the company than to allow outside competitors to steal the revenue and market share.\nFinal Recommendation:\nCaesars Entertainment should open a new casino in Philadelphia. The new casino will only affect the customers in Philadelphia due to the geographic area. The customers depending on the segment will react very differently to the opening of a new casino in Philadelphia and all these needs to be assessed. However, there are some risks associated:\n\n competitor opens the casino first and gets the 1st mover advantage by opening their casino earlier.\n there may be high costs of construction or operation of the new casino in Philadelphia.\n\nBonus Question #3: How can the client Caesars Entertainment make up for the lost revenues?\nPossible Answer:\nTo make up for the lost revenues, the client could:\n\nCharge an entrance fee to their existing casinos\nEliminates amenities (e.g. free drinks)\nIncrease other revenue streams (food, hotel, show, etc)\nStimulate new customer demand through:\n\n Customer loyalty programs\n Promotional giveaways\n Increased marketing\n Targeting customers in cities near Philadelphia but far from Atlantic City or vice versa\n\n\nSteal market share from existing competing casinos in Atlantic City through similar means as listed above.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

In reference to labor relations and plant locations in France can be a point of discussion for bonus point.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The company started offering discount brokerage on May 1, 1975 and since then has become one of the largest discount brokers in the world. Schwab offers the same services as a traditional brokerage, but with lower commissions and fees. The company serves 7.9 million client brokerage accounts as of September 2011.\nIn addition to discount brokerage, the company also offers services such as asset management, investment research, mutual funds, annuities, bond trading, checking, savings, and mortgages.\nCharles Schwab had annual revenues of USD $5 billion last year. They are operating throughout the US with 300 branches opened. Half of these branches are corporate and half are franchised.\nQuestion #1: What are the economics of Charles Schwab’s business?\nPossible Solution:\nA good structure or framework will identify the followings:\nIn order to analyze the economics of the business I need to find more information about their revenues and costs. Then, I would like to look into what competition is doing on the market, how segmented the market is and who are the consumers and what their needs are.\nOn the revenue side, I need to understand where the client’s revenues are coming from and then break it into the two components: price and quantity\nOn the cost side, I would like to look at the fixed and variable costs:\n\nFixed costs:\n\n SG&A (Selling General and Administrative Expenses)\n IT system\n Marketing costs\n\n\nVariable costs:\n\n Labor\n Other cost related to broker commissions, fees, etc\n\n\n\nThe next thing that I would like to look into is what competition is doing:\n\n how many competitors do we have?\n are there new competitors in the market?\n have they stolen share from us?\n are they offering services that we are not?\n\nWe also need to understand how the overall market is doing:\n\n is it growing or shrinking?\n how segmented is the market?\n are there any specificities related to regions?\n\nFurthermore, I would also look at the consumers/customers:\n\n who are they?\n what do they want?\n how do our client’s products meet their needs?\n\nAdditional Information to be provided upon request:\n1. Revenues\nThe client Charles Schwab’s revenues come from 2 different divisions:\n\n Trading: $3 Billion\n Asset Management: $2 Billion\n\nTrading means that brokers do specific transactions as per their customer’s requests, like buy or sell 1,000 shares of XYZ stock. The revenue in this division would come from a fixed fee of $10 per transaction.\nIn the Asset Management division, the firm is administering the customer’s money and the revenues come from a percentage from the total amount of assets under management (AUM) which is 1%\n2. Costs\n\nFixed costs: $1B\n\n $800M – IT system ($700M from Trading and $100M from Asset Management)\n $100M – Marketing\n $100M – SG&A\n\n\nVariable costs:\n\n Trading:\n\n Commission to brokers: 40% of revenues\n Other costs: $2 per transaction\n\n\n Asset Management:\n\n Commission to brokers: 40% of revenues\n Fee to an outsourcing investment firm that is managing the assets: 0.4%\n\n\n\n\n\nPossible Solution:\nThe candidate should now do the calculations for the profits:\nProfits = Revenues – Costs\nTrading division:\n\n Revenues = $3B\n Number of transactions = $3B / $10 = 300 million\n Fixed Costs = $700M (IT) + $60M (Marketing, pro rated from the revenues) + $60M (SG&A, pro rated from the revenues) = $820M\n Variable costs:\n\n Commission: 40% of the $10 fee = $4 per transaction\n Other = $2 per transaction\n Variable costs = ($4 + $2) * 300 million = $1.8B\n\n\n\nAsset management division:\n\n Revenues = $2B\n Total assets under management (AUM) = $2B / 1% = $200B\n Fixed Costs = $100M (IT) + $40M (Marketing, pro rated from the revenues) + $40M (SG&A, pro rated from the revenues) = $180M\n Variable costs:\n\n Commission: 40% of the $2B revenue = $800M\n Fee for the outsourcing investment company = 0.4% of the $200B total administered assets = $200B * 0.4% = $800M\n Variable costs = $800M + $800M = $1.6B\n\n\n\nProfits:\n\n Trading profits = $3B – $1.8B – $820M = $380M\n Profit margin = $380M / $3B = 12.66%\n Asset Management profits = $2B – $180M – $1.6B = $220M\n Profit margin = $220M / $2B = 11%\n\nA good candidate will also observe that Trading is slightly more profitable than Asset Management.\nQuestion #2: Now we are almost in an economic depression. What would happen to this firm if an economic recession would happen next year? Calculate by how much they need to increase the number of transactions and assets under management now in order to breakeven in each division in case of recession.\nAdditional Information:\nDuring the last recession, the client’s\n\n Number of transaction decreased by 50%\n Assets managed decreased by 20%\n\nPossible Answer:\nIn order to do that I need to know what happened with this firm at the last recession in order to try to benchmark the effects.\nNote: if the interviewee does not ask for past recession effects, ask him/her to brainstorm on how they can estimate the effects of the incoming recession till they get to this answer.\nFor Trading:\nIf x = the number of transaction needed to break even\n# of transaction * revenue per transaction = fixed costs + # of transaction * variable cost per transaction\n(50% * x) * $10 = $820M + (50% * x) * $6\nx = 410M\nCurrent # of transaction = 300M\n(410M – 300M) / 300M = 36.7% = ~37%\nThey will need to increase the number of transaction by ~37%. I don’t think this is feasible in a short period of time, especially just before a recession.\nFor Asset management:\nIf y = the amount of assets needed to break even\nAmount of assets * % of assets = fixed costs for asset management + variable costs for asset management\n(80% * y) * 1% = $180M + [(y * 80% * 1% * 40%) + (80% * y * 0.4%)]\ny = $112.5B\nSo, there is no risk of becoming unprofitable in this division even under a recession.\nQuestion #3: How can they address the risk of the recession? How can they keep the company’s profitability at current levels?\nPossible Answer:\nThey can either try to increase the revenues or decrease the costs.\nIncrease revenues:\n\nChange the product mix – get more asset management business because it is more profitable\n\n Advertise\n Incentivize brokers to get more assets\n Offer more benefits for customers coming to us instead of competition\n Extend office locations\n Offer new products for current customers\n Put in place a field sales team of brokers to get more assets or trade customers either by attracting more and richer customers or by making the current ones put more money in\n\n\nGet more, richer customers\nIncrease the fee per transaction or the percentage for the asset under management\nSegment the market and differentiate depending on customer\n\nDecrease costs:\n\nFixed costs:\n\n IT seems to be the highest: outsource IT because it can also bring some other benefits like expertise from an IT firm, risk dispersion if it breaks down\n Use cheaper systems, less qualified labor\n\n\nVariable costs:\n\n Decrease the commission for brokers\n Get the asset management in house instead of outsourcing\n Link the commission of the brokers to the performance, create an incentive system to actually make them bring more business.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: increase sales/revenues; improve profits.\nConsulting Firm: Advisory Board Company second round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: banking; financial services.\nCase Interview Question #00654: Our client Wilmington Trust is a subsidiary of Buffalo, New York-based retail banking and financial service company M&T Bank (NYSE: MTB). In addition to its core business of standard banking services such as deposits and loans, Wilmington Trust also has business segments devoted to Corporate Client Services, primarily for private businesses in the US, the Caribbean, and Europe; and to Wealth Advisory Services, which includes personal trust, financial planning, fiduciary, asset management, and family office services. As of fiscal year 2012, Wilmington Trust has about 100,000 clients, with $500 million in revenues, and $150 million in net income.\nFor this case, our client Wilmington Trust’s goal is to double the revenues and profits of the business in 5 years. You have been asked by the  CEO of Wilmington Trust to assess the feasibility of the goal. Also, you will need to help the client prioritize the two or three most important steps that Wilmington Trust should take in their action plan. How would you go about this case?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate upon request)\nThe interviewer or case giver should read this information well before he/she gives the case. Share this information in each bullet only if the candidate specifically asks for it in a clear and deliberate way.\n1. Revenues: The client makes their revenues mostly from interest and fees\n2. Costs: Transaction costs and employee salaries. The nature of the sale is one-on-one pitch between the bank sales person and the customer. So the salary cost and the transaction costs tend to be high.\n3. Geography: They have a large presence in the North East and a moderate presence in the South East.\n4. Products: They have 4 product lines, with the following ranks in revenue and profit generation.\n\n\n\n\nRevenues\nProfits\n\n\nPrivate banking: deposits, loans\n1\n1\n\n\nInvestment management: brokerage, advisory, access\n2\n3\n\n\nTrust: state planning and trust, transferred death\n3\n2\n\n\nInsurance\n4\n2\n\n\n\n5. Customers: 20%-25% of Wilmington Trust’s customers purchase more than one product. 75%-80% of customers purchase only one product. The customers are segmented into 5 groups based on the sales volume they generate.\n\n\n\n\nSales Volume\nNumber of Customers\n\n\nUltra High:\n$10M+\n5%\n\n\nHigh Net:\n$1M – $10M\n10%\n\n\nAffluent:\n$0.5M – $1M\n20%\n\n\nMass Affluent:\n$100,000 – $500,000\n25%\n\n\nMass:\n$0 – $100,000\n40%\n\n\n\nThe Ultra High, High Net, and Affluent customer segments generate 60%-70% of the total revenues, while the Mass Affluent and Mass segments generate 30%-40% of the revenues.\nPossible Answer:\nThis is a typical “increase revenues” and “increase profits” type of case. Once the candidate has gathered all the necessary information through relevant questions, he/she should start analyzing the numbers to make fact based recommendations.\n1. Buyer selection\nSince the transaction costs tend to be the same for the different customer segments, it makes sense to grow the number of the higher revenue generating customers and decrease the number of the lower revenue generating customers. We can attract the top 3 customer segments by marketing more selectively and doing promotions for higher income customer groups. We can discourage less affluent customers by raising the prices on them, giving them the option to add more profits or switch to a competitor.\n2. Cross sell\nSince 75%-80% of Wilmington Trust’s customers purchase only one product, there is an opportunity for cross-sell between the different product lines. Assuming that we will only serve the top 3 customer segments:\n\nRevenue generated by customers in top 3 customer segments (70%) = $500M * 70% = $350M\nRevenue generated by customers who only have one product (80%) = $350M * 80% = $280M\n\nIf we assume that the 4 types of products generate comparable revenues, then if we cross-sell each customer 3 other products then the new revenue will be = $280 * 4 = $1,120M, which is more than double the current revenue of $500M.\nConclusion\nIt is feasible to double revenues and profits if we can only cross-sell our current customers the other products in our business. The next steps the client Wilmington Trust should take are:\n\nGive incentives to the bank’s sales force to cross sell different products to its existing customers.\nDo heavy promotions for the top 3 affluent market segments.\nIncrease its prices in its bottom 2 mass market segments to “fire” its unprofitable market segments.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: increase revenue, increase price.\nConsulting Firm: Simon-Kucher & Partners (SKP) first round summer internship job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: tourism, hospitality, lodging.\nCase Interview Question #00655: Hyatt Hotels Corporation (NYSE: H) is a global hospitality company and the operator of the Hyatt brand hotel chains. Headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, United States, the company’s worldwide portfolio consisted of more than 400 properties under several brands as of June 30, 2012.\nThe client Hyatt Hotels Corporation operates several hotel chains. Among them, the Hyatt Regency brand is the oldest brand in the company, with the Grand Hyatt, Hyatt Place and Park Hyatt brands being introduced in 1980. Hyatt Regency hotels are aimed at convention and business travelers as well as leisure travelers and are located in urban, suburban, airport, convention and resort destinations around the world. Grand Hyatt hotels are large-scale hotels that provide upscale accommodations in major cities. Hyatt Place hotels are mid-sized properties designed for families and business travelers; they are located in urban, airport and suburban areas.\nRecently, your consulting firm has been retained by the CEO of Hyatt Hotels to advise whether they should raise their average daily room rate from $180 to $200. How would you go about the case? What recommendations would you give to the CEO of Hyatt?\nAdditional Information:\n\nIndustry Overview: the overall hotel and hospitality market in the US is stable, it grows with GDP growth.\nMarket Segmentation: the hotel and hospitality industry can broadly be divided into two segments that serve different customer needs – one for business purposes and the other for vacation.\nCompetition: The client Hyatt is the leader in the Business Hotel segment and an average player in the Vacation Hotel segment.\n\nNote to Interviewer:\nRead the “Additional Information” section well before you give the case. There’s very limited information to begin with the case, therefore the candidate is expected to ask questions, but in a structured way. Allow 20-30 seconds for the candidate to layout his/her assumptions for each step of the analysis before giving any clues. Certain level of stress should be created but the overall interview style is pleasant.\nPossible Solution:\nAfter a brief discussion of the hotel market segmentation, the interviewer should let the candidate characterize each segment. For example:\n\n Business hotels are usually located in the center of metropolitan areas, usually are smaller in size compared to the average vacation resorts, are better equipped with in-room business services like telephone/internet/fax/printer, and are more flexible in booking.\n Vacation hotels have to be in a touristy or scenery area but not necessary in the center of it, have a wider range of price and facilities, and with more fluctuations in demand.\n\nA. Internal Company Analysis\nQuestion #1: The client Hyatt has decided to focus on the Business Hotel unit. Why do you think they made such decision?\nPossible Answer:\n1. Location advantage: since the client is already the leader in this segment, they must have already blocked the best locations in most of the big cities. Competitors are hard to compete with this given the fact that the supply of space in hot spots is very limited.\n2. Steady revenue stream: once contracts with big corporations are signed, the demand of business traveling is much easier to predict than vacation hotels which contributes to a higher occupancy rate. In addition, a fixed price can be set more easily.\n3. Lower maintenance cost: business hotels tend to be smaller in size and need less recreational facilities.\nQuestion #2: From an internal view of the client company, why do you think they wanted to increase the price?\nPossible Answer:\nTo increase profitability.\nQuestion #3: Does it make sense from Hyatt Hotel’s internal view?\nPossible Answer:\nThe usual Profits = Revenues – Costs = Price * Quantity – (Fixed Cost + Variable Cost) function should appear here.\nOn the cost side, the interviewer may hint the candidate that there’s not much room for cost saving by saying something like\n\n “they already outsourced the cleaning service”\n “they just went through a major layoff and cut the staff by half”\n “their in-hotel restaurants and bars are operating efficiently”, etc.\n\nOn the revenue side, both increasing quantity (occupancy rate) and price (room rate) can increase Hyatt Hotel’s revenue.\nB. External Consumer Analysis\nQuestion #4: How is the proposed price increase from $180 to $200 going to impact consumers’ behavior?\nPossible Answer:\nThe candidate should look into both the “end user” (the actual business travelers) and the “customer” (the corporations that Hyatt Hotel has contracts with).\nThe impact on end users is limited since they don’t actually pay for the hotel. They won’t stop staying at Hyatt Hotel as long as the service level, flexibility, location, and other conditions remain the same.\nFor the customers, most of them have long and stable relationship with the client Hyatt Hotel (that’s what makes Hyatt Hotel the leader of Business Hotel). Therefore, the customers will leave only if\n\nthe price is not competitive compare to Hyatt Hotel’s competitors (in this case it’s still competitive)\nthe price exceeds the cap of its traveling expense (in this case the cap is $240)\nno extra benefits come with the price increase (in this case Hyatt Hotel provides better services, more business friendly facilities, etc.)\n\nQuestion #5: Assuming that Hyatt Hotel successfully increased the price from $180 to $200, what can they do to the “end user” to increase demand?\nPossible Answer:\nThe interviewer should encourage the candidate to be creative here, but make sure they hit the following points.\nDifferentiation: On the product side, Hyatt Hotel can\n\n improve its convenience, e.g. provide transportation to/from the airports, get the hottest spot in the emerging area of a city, etc.\n increase its business friendliness, e.g. offer in-room fax/printer\n upgrade its rooms, etc.\n\nFor the service, Hyatt Hotel can create a more personalized experience for consumers by keeping track of each traveler’s special demand, set the room differently, etc.\nOne step further, Hyatt Hotel can also lock consumers in by offering traveler specific promotion (different from the ones for the corporate), such as offering free gifts to the consumers (e.g. shopping coupons) or cross promotion between Hyatt Hotel’s business hotels and vacation hotels (e.g. free stay at one of the vacation hotels when the traveler takes his/her family on vacation next time).\nC. Conclusion\nQuestion #6: Ask for a final recommendation. A star candidate will see that his/her time is nearly up and will present a “Go/No go” recommendation without prompting. If the interview is within 3 minutes of the end, the interviewer should ask for the conclusion.\nPossible Answer:\nThe short answer is “Yes”.\nHyatt Hotel has competitive advantage given its superior location, good service, and trust worthy relationship with long term customers. Given such strong base, there’s room for Hyatt Hotel to increase its price with further differentiated product and service.\nEven after the $20 price increase, the price is still far below its customer’s ceiling ($240) and remains competitive among its competitors. Furthermore, Hyatt Hotel can still grow its sales quantity by locking travelers who have several business hotel choices in by adopting traveler specific promotions.\nFrom an internal point of view, cost saving has reached a limit. Hyatt Hotel has to improve its profits by top line growth. As long as price doesn’t effect quantity (in this case occupancy rate), total revenue will grow.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

You have been hired by the CEO of Health Net to solve this problem. Why did the client’s profit decline last year? What could be done to restore profitability?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate upon request)\nThe interviewer should read the following information well before he/she gives the case. Basic information should be given as the candidate asks for it, but the rest of the interview is very directive. The candidate is supposed to follow the direction and do the math confidently. The interview style is pleasant and helpful.\n\nThe client Health Net’s key revenues come from commissions.\nHealth Net signs contracts with physicians and provides medical and health care services to their health plan customers.\nHealth Net has a network of 3,000 contracted physicians nation wide.\nA “referral” to another health care provider is necessary if certain medical treatment/service can’t be provided by Health Net’s network of contracted physicians.\n\nQuestion #1: How would you approach this problem? What are some of the possible reasons the client’s profits declined last year?\nPossible Answer:\nProfits = Revenues – Costs = Number of patients treated * (unit price – Variable cost) – Fixed cost\nThe candidate can be creative to come up with possible reasons for revenue decrease and cost increase. Some examples are:\nRevenue declined\n\n number of patients dropped\n unit price dropped\n competition grew their market share\n\nCost increased\n\n Variable cost: number of visits increased (e.g. major flu), per person cost increased (e.g. cost of the medicine increased), referral cost increased\n Fixed cost: contracted physician’s salary increased\n\nQuestion #2: Competitor Analysis (show Exhibit to candidate) – why is our client’s referral cost higher than the competitor’s?\nAdditional Information:\n\n\n\nPlayer\nHealth Net\nCoventry Health Care\n\n\nNumber of patients treated\n300,000\n500,000\n\n\nReferral cost\n$20 per member per month\n$15 per member per month\n\n\n\nPossible Answer: (again, the candidate is encouraged to be creative here)\n\nEconomies of scale: competitor Coventry Health Care has much bigger customer base\nLower administration costs: competitor operates more efficiently\nCompetitor Coventry Health Care has more contracted physicians\n\nQuestion #3: Assuming that none of the client’s contracted physicians have the specialty of cardiology, estimate the number of referrals per year for cardiology based on the following additional information:\nAdditional Information:\n\nTotal number of patients treated in a year: 300,000.\n20% of the total population in US is > 65 years old, and 30% of them need cardiology treatment.\nFor the rest of the population, there’s a 10% chance for them to require some cardiology treatment.\nThe cardiology treatment usually requires 5 visits to the doctor per year.\n\nPossible Answer:\n> 65 years = 300,000 * 20% * 30% = 18,000\n< 65 years = 300,000 * 80% * 10% = 24,000\nTotal: 18,000 + 24,000 = 42,000\n42,000 * 5 times/year = 210,000 times/year\nQuestion #4: The actual number of cardiology referrals is 300,000 a year. Why is it higher than the estimate?\nPossible Answer:\n\nHealth Net’s clients do not have the same weight between different ages as the total US population\nThey underestimated the number of visits per year, actual number of visits if greater than 5\nMore demanding patients ask to be referred even if they don’t have such issues\nPhysicians refer non-cardiology patients because they don’t want to take the risk and are not motivated to provide services even if they are capable\n\nQuestion #5: How much does the number of referrals have to decrease in order to justify following incentive plan to encourage contracted physicians to be more responsible?\nAdditional Information:\nIncentive plan:\n\n Bonus to physicians: give $100,000 / year to top 10 physicians with the lowest referral rate\n Physicians training cost: $1,000,000 a year\n\nReferral cost: $200 per referral\nCurrent number of referral: 300,000 a year\nPossible Answer:\nTotal cost of the incentive plan = $100,000 * 10 + $1,000,000 = $2,000,000\nTo compensate for the cost of $2,000,000, the number of referrals will have to decrease by\n$2,000,000 / $200 per referral = 10,000\nQuestion #6: If the incentive plan can reduce the number of referrals by 5% for year one and 2% for year two, what is the total saving?\nPossible Answer:\nYear 1 = 300,000 * 5% = 15,000\nYear 2 = (300,000 – 15,000) * 2% = 5,700\nTotal saving = (15,000 + 5,700) * $200 – $2,000,000 * 2 = $140,000\nQuestion #7: Apart from Cardiology, how can the client Health Net reduce the number of referrals in general?\nPossible Answer:\n\nIncrease training to improve physician’s capability\nExtend the incentive program to other departments\nImprove the quality of relationship with the patients and build up the trust\nImprove/remove physicians who are outliers with extremely high referral rate\nIncrease the number of contracted physicians\nPartner with other health care provider to lower referral cost\n\nQuestion #8: Ask the candidate to make a final recommendation to the client.\nPossible Answer:\nAccording to the example of cardiology, the client Health Net should improve its profitability by lowering the referral cost. Health Net can either:\n\nreduce the number of referrals, and/or\nreduce the cost per referral\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

(NYSE: VMW) is an American software company that provides cloud and virtualization software and services to both personal and corporate customers. The company’s desktop software runs on Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X, while VMware’s enterprise software hypervisors run directly on server hardware without requiring an additional underlying operating system.\nVMware has its headquarters in Palo Alto, California, United States, and established an R&D Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts, as well as one at the Time Warner Center in New York City. Recently, the Chairman of VMware wants to offshore/outsource its engineering and designing unit to India, as well as to penetrate into the India software engineering market. Should they do it? Why or why not?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate upon request)\nThe candidate is supposed to figure out the following information by asking appropriate questions. The interviewer is supposed to read this information well before he/she gives the case. The interview style should be pleasant but reserved.\n1. Market Share – in the US the client VMware is the industry leader in cloud service and virtualization software with several close followers chasing behind.\n2. Profitability – profitability is declining (unknown reason, but increasing labor costs can be a reasonable assumption).\n3. Capability – VMware has strong engineering department in the US.\n4. Cost – R&D is the major cost and Indian software engineers are estimated to be only 1/4 of the cost of the US engineers with the same technical capability.\n5. Customer\n\n The client VMware has a strong existing customer base in the US.\n Customers care about the quality of service, but are also considering lowering cost in the long run.\n\n6. Competitions\n\nCompetition – US:\n\nKey US competitors (Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, HP, Google, etc) are all off-shoring in order to lower the R&D cost.\n\n\nCompetition – International:\n\n The growth of the international market is impressive compared to the more mature and stable US market.\n Key competitors are expanding their international business aggressively.\n India is one of the fastest growing international markets as well as the one with the largest market size.\n\n\n\nPossible Solution:\nSince the goal of this “market entry” case is two-fold, a good candidate will begin with laying out a clear scope and then gather relevant information to analyze the situation. A decision matrix can be created to guide the analysis.\n\n\n\n\nOff-shoring is critical to access local market?\n\n\n\nOther benefits of offshoring\nYes\nNo\n\n\nSignificant\nDefinitely offshore\nOffshore but also find out other critical factors to enter the India market\n\n\nMinor\nEvaluate the India market independently with market, customer, competition, etc.\nStay in current market and strengthen competitiveness\n\n\n\nOnce the candidate has gathered the necessary information regarding VMware’s customers, a strong candidate should follow up with additional questions about Customer Segmentation.\nIt turns out most of VMware’s clients are medium to large companies in the US.\n\n The most profitable clients are large companies in developed countries where VMware already has a strong base.\n Currently, VMware doesn’t have any international presence yet.\n\nAt this point, a strong candidate will get the hint that entering the international market, especially the India market, is critical for the client company to both fulfill current customer’s emerging needs of cost saving and grow its future business. The candidate should then start to compare the competitive advantages between large US companies off-shoring and local Indian players.\n\n\n\n\nUS companies\nIndian players\n\n\nAbility to fulfill customized needs\nstrong\nmedium\n\n\nHigh quality services\nstrong\nmedium\n\n\nAccess to most profitable clients\nstrong\nweak\n\n\nCost advantage\nweak\nstrong\n\n\nLocal India market knowledge\nweak\nstrong\n\n\nLocal client / government / supply chain relationships\nweak\nstrong\n\n\nLow legal risks\nstrong\nstrong\n\n\n\nAn outstanding candidate will summarize his/her findings and make a final “Go / No go” recommendation.\nConclusion\nBased on the above analysis, the short answer is “Yes”, the client VMware should outsource its engineering/designing unit to India. The situation falls into the upper left corner of the matrix because:\n\nIn the long-run, even current customers with established relationship will need to look for cheaper alternatives. VMware can offshore its R&D to lower the cost but still keeps its customer service team in the US to maintain the high service quality.\nAlthough clients in the developed countries are more profitable, the actual growth of the market is limited. Developing markets like India might not be as profitable as the US, but with the huge and growing market size, even capturing a small percentage of the market can provide substantial profits.\nVMware might lack knowledge of the Indian market, but its strong customer relationship management skills, large existing customer bass, and the understating of unique customer needs can be further leveraged in India. In addition, hiring local talent or partnering with local companies can help solve the concern of the lack of local knowledge.\nThe legal risk as well as the political risk in India can be considered very low.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: merger and acquisition (M&A).\nConsulting Firm: McKinsey & Company final round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: restaurant & food services.\nCase Interview Question #00659: Our client is Great Burger, a fast food chain that competes head-to-head with McDonald’s, Wendy’s, Burger King, KFC, etc. Currently, Great Burger is the fourth largest fast food chain worldwide, measured by the number of stores in operation. As most of its competitors do, Great Burger offers food and “combos” for the three largest meal occasions: breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\nEven though Great Burger owns some of its stores, it operates under the franchising business model with 85% of its stores owned by franchisees. Individual franchisees own and manage stores under the “Great Burger” brand, pay franchise fee to Great Burger, but major business decisions, e.g., menu, look of store, are controlled by Great Burger.\nAs part of its growth strategy, Great Burger has analyzed some potential acquisition targets including Canton, Massachusetts based Dunkin’ Donuts (DD), a growing doughnut producer with both a U.S. and international store presence.\nDunkin’ Donuts operates under the franchising business model too, though a little bit differently than Great Burger. While Great Burger franchises restaurants, Dunkin’ Donuts franchises areas or regions in which the franchisee is required to open a certain number of stores.\nGreat Burger’s CEO has hired McKinsey to advise him on whether they should acquire Dunkin’ Donuts or not. How would you go about this case? Should Great Burger acquire Dunkin’ Donuts as part of its growth strategy?\nQuestion #1: What areas would you want to explore to determine whether Great Burger should acquire Dunkin’ Donuts (DD)?\nPossible Answer:\nSome possible areas are given below. Great job if you identified several of these and perhaps others.\na. Stand alone value of DD\n\nGrowth in market for doughnuts\nDD’s past and projected future sales growth (break down into growth in number of stores, and growth in same store sales)\nCompetition – are there any other major national chains that are doing better than DD in terms of growth/profit. What does this imply for future growth?\nProfitability/profit margin\nCapital required to fund growth (capital investment to open new stores, working capital)\n\nb. Synergies/strategic fit\n\n Brand quality similar? Would they enhance or detract from each other if marketed side by side?\n How much overlap of customer base? (very little overlap might cause concern that brands are not compatible, too much might imply little room to expand sales by cross-marketing)\n Synergies (Hint: do not dive deep on this, as it will be covered later)\n\nc. Management team/cultural fit\n\n Capabilities/skills of top, middle management\n Cultural fit, if very different, what percent of key management would likely be able to adjust\n\nd. Ability to execute merger/combine companies\n\n Great Burger experience with mergers in past/experience in integrating companies\n Franchise structure differences. Detail “dive” into franchising structures. Would these different structures affect the deal?\n\nThe McKinsey team started thinking about potential synergies that could be achieved by acquiring DD. Here are some key facts on Great Burger and DD.\nExhibit 1\n\n\n\n\nStores\nGreat Burger\nDunkin’ Donuts\n\n\nTotal\n5,000\n1,020\n\n\nNorth America\n3,500\n1,000\n\n\nEurope\n1,000\n20\n\n\nAsia\n400\n0\n\n\nOther\n100\n0\n\n\nAnnual growth in stores\n10%\n15%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancials\nGreat Burger\nDunkin’ Donuts\n\n\nTotal store sales\n$5,500m\n$700m\n\n\nParent company revenue\n$1,900m\n$200m\n\n\nKey expenses (% sales)\n\n\n\n\n* Cost of sales\n51%\n40%\n\n\n* Restaurant operating costs\n24%\n26%\n\n\n* Restaurant property & equipment costs\n4.6%\n8.5%\n\n\n* Corporate general & administrative costs\n8%\n15%\n\n\nProfit as % of sales\n6.3%\n4.9%\n\n\nSales/stores\n$1.1m\n$0.7m\n\n\nIndustry average\n$0.9m\n$0.8m\n\n\n\nQuestion #2: What potential synergies can you think of between Great Burger and Dunkin’ Donuts (DD)?\nPossible Answer:\nWe are looking for a few responses similar to the ones below:\na. Lower costs\n\n Biggest opportunity likely in corporate selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A) by integrating corporate management\n May be some opportunity to lower food costs with larger purchasing volume on similar food items (e.g., beverages, deep frying oil), however overlaps may be low as ingredients are very different\n Great Burger appears to have an advantage in property and equipment costs which might be leveragable to DD (e.g., superior skills in lease negotiation)\n\nb. Increase revenues\n\n Sell doughnuts in Great Burger stores, or some selected Great Burger products in DD stores\n Great Burger has much greater international presence thus likely has knowledge/skills to enable DD to expand outside of North America\n Great Burger may have superior skills in identifying attractive locations for stores as its sales per store are higher than industry average, whereas DD’s is lower than industry average; might be able to leverage this when opening new DD stores to increase DD average sales per store\n Expand DD faster than it could do on own–Great Burger, as a larger company with lower debt, may have better access to capital\n\nQuestion #3: The McKinsey team thinks that with synergies, it should be possible to double DD’s U.S. market share in the next 5 years, and that Great Burger’s access to capital will allow it to expand the number of DD stores by 2.5 times. What sales per store will DD require in 5 years in order for Great Burger to achieve these goals? Use any data from Exhibit 1 you need, additionally, your interviewer would provide the following assumptions for you:\n\nDoughnut consumption/capita in the U.S. is $10/year today, and is projected to grow to $20/year in 5 years.\nFor ease of calculation, assume U.S. population is 300m.\n\n \nPossible Answer:\nYou should always feel free to ask your interviewer additional questions to help you with your response.\nPossible responses might include the following:\n\nMarket share today: $700M DD sales (from Exhibit 1) ÷ $3B U.S. market ($10 * 300M people) = 23% (round to 25% for simplicity sake)\n U.S. market in 5 years = $20 * 300M people = $6B\n DD sales if double market share: 50% * $6B = $3B\n Per store sales: $3B / (1000 stores * 2.5) = $1.2M\n\nDoes this seem reasonable? — Yes, given it implies less than double same store sales growth and per capita consumption is predicted to double.\nQuestion #4: One of the synergies that the McKinsey team thinks might have a big potential is the idea of increasing the businesses’ overall profitability by selling doughnuts in Great Burger stores. How would you assess the profitability impact of this synergy?\nPossible Answer:\nBe sure you can clearly explain how the assessment you are proposing would help to answer the question posed. Some possible answers include:\n\nCalculate incremental revenues by selling doughnuts in Great Burger stores (calculate how many doughnuts per store, times price per doughnut, times number of Great Burger stores)\nCalculate incremental costs by selling doughnuts in Great Burger stores (costs of production, incremental number of employees, employee training, software changes, incremental marketing and advertising, incremental cost of distribution if we cannot produce doughnuts in house, etc.)\nCalculate incremental investments. Do we need more space in each store if we think we are going to attract new customers? Do we need to invest in store layout to have in-house doughnut production?\nIf your answer were to take into account cannibalization, what would be the rate of cannibalization with Great Burger offerings? Doughnut cannibalization will be higher with breakfast products than lunch and dinner products, etc.\nOne way to calculate this cannibalization is to look at historic cannibalization rates with new product/offering launchings within Great Burger stores\nMight also cannibalize other DD stores if they are nearby Great Burger store–could estimate this impact by seeing historical change in DD’s sales when competitor doughnut store opens nearby\n\nQuestion #5: What would be the incremental profit per store if we think we are going to sell 50,000 doughnuts per store at a price of $2 per doughnut at a 60 percent margin with a cannibalization rate of 10 percent of Great Burger’s sales?\nExhibit 2\n\n\n\nSales and profitability per store\n\n\n\nUnits of Great Burger sold per store\n300,000\n\n\nSales price per unit\n$3 per unit\n\n\nMargin\n50%\n\n\nUnits of DD sold in Great Burger stores\n50,000\n\n\nSales price per unit\n$2 per unit\n\n\nMargin\n60%\n\n\nCannibalization rate of DD products to Great Burger products\n10%\n\n\n\nPossible Answer:\nWhile you may find that doing straightforward math problems in the context of an interview is a bit tougher, you can see that it is just a matter of breaking the problem down. We are looking at both your ability to set the analysis up properly and then do the math in real time.\nBased on correct calculations, your response should be as follows:\nIncremental profit = contribution from DD sales less contribution lost due to cannibalized Great Burger sales = 50K units * $2/unit * 60% margin – 300K units * 10% cannibalization * $3/unit * 50% margin = $60K – 45K = 15K incremental profit/store\nQuestion #6: You run into the CEO of Great Burger in the hall. He asks you to summarize McKinsey’s perspective so far on whether Great Burger should acquire DD. Pretend the interviewer is the CEO, what would you say?\nPossible Answer:\nYou may have a slightly different list. Whatever your approach, we love to see candidates come at a problem in more than one way, but still address the issue as directly and practically as possible.\nAnswers may vary, but here is an example of a good response:\n\nEarly findings lead us to believe acquiring DD would create significant value for Great Burger, and that Great Burger should acquire DD\n\n We believe that our client can add $15 thousand in profit per Great Burger store by selling DD in Great Burger stores. This could mean $50 million in incremental profit for North American stores (where immediate synergies are most likely given DD has little brand presence in rest of world)\n We also believe there are other potential revenue and cost synergies that the team still needs to quantify\n\n\nOnce our team has quantified the incremental revenues, cost savings, and investments, we will make a recommendation on the price you should be willing to pay.\nWe will also give you recommendations on what it will take to integrate the two companies in order to capture the potential revenue and cost savings, and also to manage the different franchise structures and potentially different cultures of Great Burger and DD.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

It is part of the Phillips-Van Heusen Company (NYSE: PVH), headquartered in Manhattan, New York City, United States. The client purchased their high-end, brand name sports attire operation from French apparel company Lacoste 10 years ago. Since then, Izod has become one of the leading men’s sportswear manufacturers in the UK.\nFor the past 10 years Izod has managed respectable sales growth. However, they would now like to double their sales within the next year. Our consulting firm has been hired by the CEO of Izod to explore both internal and external opportunities for growth. Specifically, we have been asked to help with the following two questions:\n\n Is doubling of sales possible in one year?\n If so, come up with a clear recommendation for achieving this goal.\n\nHow would you go about this case?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate upon request)\nThe interviewer or case giver should aait to see if the candidates ask for this relevant information before giving it to them.\n1. Company\n\nClient Izod’s current sales = ~$20M a year\nIzod’s current market share in high-end sports wear = ~50%\nThe client has been in the market for over 70 years\nClient Izod’s own designers design the clothes in China\nClothes are manufactured in China and shipped directly to the UK stores\nClothes are sold exclusively through the client’s own high end stores in select UK cities\n\n2. Market\n\n The market relevant for the client is divided along 2 dimensions:\n\n 1. Brand quality/image: Low end, Medium end, High end\n 2. Type of men’s wear: Casual, Multi-Purpose, Sports\n\n\n Overall expected market growth: 5% per year\n\nTable 1: Oeverall men’s wear market size in UK\n\n\n\nTotal Sports Sales:\n~$150M\n\n\nTotal Multi-Purpose Sales:\n~$500M\n\n\nTotal Casual Sales:\n~$1.3B\n\n\n\nTable 2: Percentage of Low, Medium, and High end for each type of men’s wear\n\n\n\nSegment\nCasual\nMulti-Purpose\nSports\n\n\nHigh end\n7%\n19%\n24% (client’s current market)\n\n\nMedium end\n24%\n29%\n29%\n\n\nLow end\n69%\n52%\n47%\n\n\n\n(Note to interviewer: have these two tables ready as Exhibits/Slides, and give them to the candidate if requested)\n3. Other Relevant Information:\n\nThe client Izod would like to achieve this revenue growth within a year\nThe client increased prices about 2 years ago by ~25% and found the sales volume actually went up a little bit\nThe client is very particular about the brand image and quality in the market and would only want to sell its own products through its own stores (ask the candidate to explore the pros and cons of this)\n\nPossible Answer:\nTotal revenue growth required is 100% (or ~$20M)\n1. Overall market growth gives 5% of required revenue growth\n2. Current market\nThe client could increase their price by 25% and assume volume does not drop (based on results from previous price increase 2 years ago) – this gives another ~25% increase in revenue\n3. Enter adjacent markets\nFirst, estimate the size of the other high end markets.\n\n $500M * 19% = $95M for Multi-Purpose\n $1.3B * 7% = $91M for Casual\n Total: $95M + $91M = $186M\n\nThese are obvious adjacent markets they can explore (ask the candidate to brainstorm this argument – synergies due to brand name, same customer base and retail outlets, etc).\nNext, estimate the attainable market share from the other two high end markets: 2 approaches can be used. (Let the candidate come up with these or other ways to estimate attainable market share)\n\n First, use the market share the client gained in their first year of entry into their current sportswear market (~7%).\n Second, use the current market share of the players in each of other two high end markets (~8%). Assume that the client Izod can get an average of ~7.5% share in the first year, since the client has a very reputed name in the high-end circle and has the resources to launch effectively due to prior experience in the sportswear market.\n\nThis translates to $186M * 7.5% = ~$14M for the other 2 high end markets.\nThis translates to $14M / $20M = 70% of current sales.\n4. Conclusion\nAdding all the three above growth opportunities comes to 5% + 25% + 70% = ~100% revenue growth. Thus, it is possible for the client to double revenue in a year, with the following caveats or key issues which have to be considered.\n5. Key Issues to consider\n\nWhether the designers and manufacturers in China can ship on time with expanded product line: No problems here\nWhat about supplier relationships: No problems here\nWhat about need for new designers: No problems here\nWhat about brand image and dilution: Will not be an issue as we only enter other two high end markets\nWhat about selling through other retail outlets: Management is against this (get candidate’s thoughts on this)\nWhat about entering the low-end casual market – Even though this is a big market, fighting with the Wal-Mart’s of the clothing world may not be a good idea because of different customer base who are less brand sensitive and more price sensitive (ask candidate to explain why)\nMerger and acquisition (M&A) is not possible as growth is needed in 1 year (integration will take longer than a year)\n\nComments\n\nThe right approach to this case should quickly focus on the revenue side and ignore cost completely.\nRevenue should be broken down as price * volume. Then, opportunities to grow price (increase price) or volume (market growth and adjacent market entry) should be explored systematically.\nMaking sound assumptions for which adjacent markets to enter and what market share is attainable is very important.\nFinally, bringing up all the key issues and discussing them in a confident, engaging manner that draws the interviewer into the conversation is very important. This case is very much about good business sense. Right answers don’t have to follow the path above if the candidate displays clear industry knowledge and can lay out his/her arguments in a cogent and engaging manner.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

(NYSE: TDY), an industrial conglomerate based in Thousand Oaks, California, United States. Teledyne Technologies currently operates with three major divisions: A. Digital Imaging, B. Instrumentation and Engineered Systems, and C. Aerospace and Defense Electronics.\nRecently, every one of Teledyne Technologies’ three divisions has reported poor profits. The CEO of Teledyne Technologies has hired your consulting firm to advise him how to re-store profitability. How would you approach this case? What should the CEO do to maximize value for his shareholders?\nAdditional Information:\nThe interviewer should read this information well before he/she gives the case. The same type of information (Competition, Cost Structure, Revenues, Pricing, Market Trends, Customer Preferences, etc) is available for each of the three divisions, but make the candidate ask for each division’s information separately rather than summarizing the data for them. Do not offer any information without being asked specifically and concisely for it.\nDivision A: Digital Imaging\n\nCompetition – The client Teledyne Technologies is the clear market leader with 60% market share. \nCost Structure – Manufacturing is done in Asia by all firms and is largely considered to be as low-cost as possible.\nRevenues – This division generates over 60% of the firm’s revenues but gross margins have been declining in recent years. The high fixed costs maintained by this division have moved net income into the red as gross margins have declined.\nPricing – Prices have been becoming increasingly competitive. Division A has had to price aggressively to maintain sales volume, even with its strong market leadership position.\nMarket Trends – The overall market for division A’s product has been shrinking in the last few years and looks like it may continue to do so.\nCustomer Preferences – Customers are moving to an entirely new product category as a substitute, and prefer the product category of Division A less and less.\nThreat of Substitutes – A new product category is filling the customer need previously served by Division A’s product. Division A is not well positioned to enter this new category.\n\nDivision B: Instrumentation and Engineered Systems\n\nCompetition – The firm has only 5% and is one of many players in the market.\nCost Structure – This market is relatively new and it is believed that costs can be reduced significantly from their current position.\nRevenues – Revenues have been low but growing. The division is running a negative net cash flow as it is currently investing in marketing, R&D, and plant capacity.\nPricing – A wide range of prices exist in the market currently with margins generally high.\nMarket Trends – The overall market is growing at 10% a year and is expected to experience significant growth in the near future.\nCustomer Preferences – This is a relatively new product category and consumers are not yet sure what they want or like.\n\nDivision C: Aerospace and Defense Electronics\n\nCompetition – The firm has 50% share with only one other major competitor and a few minor ones.\nCost Structure – The firm has significant economies of scale and has the lowest variable cost in the market. Significant expenditures are being made in marketing, R&D, and plant capacity in an attempt to grow revenues.\nRevenues – Revenues have been strong with good operating margins, but have been flat for the past few years.\nPricing – Division C has a price leadership position in the market.\nMarket Trends – The overall market is not growing and expected to remain flat for the foreseeable future.\n\nPossible Solution:\nA star candidate will see that his/her time is nearly up and will present a recommendation for the client without prompting. If the interview is within 3 minutes of the end, ask the candidate: “The CEO just called and wants to know what he should do.”\nGood Answer: Clearly the conglomerate needs to rationalize its company portfolio to maximize shareholder return. Each of the three divisions is in a different stage of the market lifecycle and needs to be treated accordingly.\nDivision A finds itself in a declining industry with no apparent way to move into a new product category. As the incumbent firms struggle to maintain volume in a shrinking market, prices have fallen along with volume. Operating income is no longer enough to cover a high fixed cost base and the company is bleeding with little chance to recover. Division A should be divested immediately.\nDivision B is in an emerging growth market. While it is not making money today, it is in a favorable industry and represents a strong investment opportunity. The division should invest aggressively in R&D, marketing, and production capacity in an attempt to become the market leader by developing differentiated, branded products.\nDivision C is the leader in a mature industry and has the ability to generate a steady stream of cash for use in other investments – namely Division B. Division C should streamline operations by eliminating all expenditures not directly needed to maintain profitability and should be managed as a cash cow.\nNote:\nThis case is fairly straightforward in the analysis, but the difficulty lies in keeping the information straight between the three divisions. The interviewer should give out the information freely, but make the candidate ask for each piece of information for each division. In order to crack this case, they will need to have neat and orderly notes and be able to quickly form a mental picture of each of these different divisions.\nNote that this case is also difficult because there is only very vague information about the client’s products or industries. This is not important to the case, so don’t make anything up – just tell the candidate that they should focus on the information they have.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: improve profitability.\nConsulting Firm: Navigant Consulting first round summer internship job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: entertainment.\nCase Interview Question #00662: You are a fresh MBA just graduated from Wharton Business School. Two business school classmates of yours laud their entrepreneurship intentions and mock your interest in entering the management consulting industry. They decide that despite recent trends, what is needed is a video rental store closer to the University of Pennsylvania campus. They try to convince you to join their venture, but in your infinite wisdom you join a prominent strategy consulting firm in Philadelphia.\nWell, their first two years meet unprecedented success. They buy matching Porsches and a townhouse in Society Hill. Needless to say, each time you meet up for social occasions, they share with you (mostly with tongue in cheek) their success and a sort of “I told you so” attitude. You handle their jabs well, as you feel you have had a terrific experience at your consulting firm.\nThe story, however, changes in about 12 months. Despite two and a half years of dramatic profit and revenue growth, their video store’s profits have dramatically fallen. They call you (with a fair amount of egg on their face) and say “we don’t know what happened and our mortgage and car payments are getting tougher to meet. Can you help us? we know that you help CEO’s of large Fortune 500 companies get to the bottom of their issues”. With more than just a little satisfaction and justice in your voice you say sure.\nSo, what do you think the problem is?\nSuggested Approach:\nThis is an example of a profitability case where the interviewee must probe to get to the heart of the matter. The candidate  needs to ask questions which first diagnose the situation, and then talk about causes of the situation, and then (and only then) talk about areas of improvement.\nProfits = Revenues – Costs = Price * Volume – Costs. Here are a list of questions that the candidate should ask to get to the analysis that will help them diagnose the problem:\n\nHave costs increased?\nHave revenues declined?\nHave prices been changed?\nHave new video stores opened in the area?\nAre fewer customers coming to the store?\nAre customers renting fewer videos?\nHave other entertainment venues opened in the area?\nHave there been economic changes in the area?\n\nThese key questions will get behind what is happening: competitive changes, pricing adjustments, macro-economic factors, people not coming to your store, or people just not renting as many videos, etc.\nPossible Solution:\nThis is an example of a profitability case that is founded in 4C’s type of issues. The interviewee has to diagnose the problem and find out what is exactly going on and then find out what is causing it. The following sample answer shows how an efficient analysis is performed.\nCandidate: OK, Profits = Revenues – Costs. If profits have declined then I assume that either revenues have declined or costs have increased, what is the case?\nInterviewer: Revenues have decreased. Why would you think that cost is probably not the problem?\nCandidate: Well, video rental is a high fixed cost business. Rent, Videos and Labor are all fixed in the context of rental revenue. Thus, the business’ profits will be susceptible to changes in revenues or capacity utilization.\nRevenues are made up of number of videos we rent in a year and the price we charge. Has the management changed the price of the videos?\nInterviewer: No. What does that tell you?\nCandidate: That means that either fewer customers are coming to the store or each customer on average is renting fewer videos. Which is it?\nInterviewer: How would you figure that out?\nCandidate: The security system probably has a counter so that could tell us store traffic, and clearly the register receipts could give us number of videos rented per day. We can look at that data last year vs. this year and see whether we have a traffic problem or share of wallet problem.\nInterviewer: Excellent. If you found out it was a share of wallet problem, what would you think might be the problem?\nCandidate: Share of wallet problems are often driven by internal execution problems (bad selection, poor service, etc) whereas, traffic is often external (or market) problems.\nInterviewer: Again, excellent. The data shows that traffic has fallen. What now?\nCandidate: (Here the candidate should begin to think about hypothesis development. They have diagnosed the problem, i.e. fewer customers are coming into the store) If traffic has fallen, it is either due to a macro-economic factor or a competitive situation. My inclination is that video rentals are not that impacted by economic factors, so it is probably a competitive situation. Has a new store opened in the area?\nInterviewer: No.\nCandidate: Has a new movie theatre opened?\nInterviewer: No.\nCandidate: Mmmm…That is surprising. I was sure that this was a competitive situation and we have a fixed pool of rental community (or movie interested community) and that once a new store opened regardless of how good it was, it took share from my client’s store.\nInterviewer: Let me ask you something and maybe this will help you along. What business is your client in?\nCandidate: They are in the video rental business or the entertainment business or leisure business….I see there could be other entertainment preference shifts or options, etc.\nInterviewer: That is good intuition, but have your fully defined your client’s business. What does your client do? What purpose do they serve?\nCandidate: They rent movies for people to watch at home. They are in the home entertainment business and specifically in the home movie entertainment business. That means that the competitive set is anybody who provides movies in the home, not just video stores.\nInterviewer: Excellent. What do you think is going on here?\nCandidate: Here the interviewee has now diagnosed the problem and can make a very good hypothesis that either DVD Delivery, Cable, PPV (Pay per view), online video streaming, or new Movie on Demand technology has infiltrated the market or is experience rapid growth. Thus, the market size for store video rentals has been reduced.\nSummary Comments\nThere is no one right way to approach cases. Structure your case interviews to\n\nperform structure analysis and fact gathering to properly diagnose the problem. You could start by saying, I would interview customers to find out what they think of the store, however, that is probably not efficient, as you don’t know that customers are the problem. It could be cost, or prices, or new stores, or other choices.\nshare your logic and hypothesis whenever you can,\ndrive to an answer/assessment.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "url": "http://www.consultingcase101.com/kmart-to-test-radio-frequency-identification-rfid-in-stores/",
        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new product, new technology; math problem.\nConsulting Firm: Advisory Board Company second round summer internship job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: retail; information technology (IT).\nCase Interview Question #00661: Our client is Kmart (often stylized as K-Mart), an American chain of discount consumer goods retailer headquartered in Troy, Michigan, United States. The company was founded in 1962 and currently is the third largest discount store chain in the United States, behind Walmart (NYSE: WMT) and Target (NYSE: TGT). As of January, 2011, Kmart operated a total of 1,308 Kmart stores across 49 states, including 1,278 regular discount stores and 30 Super Stores (averaging 100,000 sq ft).\nRFID (Radio Frequency Identification) is a new technology. RFID contains a wireless non-contact system that uses radio-frequency electromagnetic fields to transfer data from a tag attached to an object, for the purposes of automatic identification and tracking. It is a tiny system that consists of wireless technology to transmit product serial numbers from tags to a scanner without human intervention. RFID technology is widely seen as the likely successor to barcode technology.\nOur client Kmart recently is investigating the possibility of requiring its Super Store suppliers to tag each product with RFID. Kmart’s board requires that all major capital improvement projects recoup all costs within 3 years or less. They have come to us to investigate this opportunity. Should we advise our client Kmart to pursue it?\n\n If so, what risks are there?\n If not, what alternatives can we investigate?\n\nPossible Solution:\n1. Structure the solution\nBelow is one possible structure, one that is probably overkill. Any structure that is able to address all relevant aspects of the issue is acceptable.\n\nCost/benefit analysis\nSupplier relationships\nConsumer privacy concerns\nTechnology considerations and capital outlay\nInternal change considerations\n\nThe main aspect of the structure for this “new product/new technology” case is cost-benefit analysis. If the candidate delves into other areas (i.e. privacy concerns), the interviewer or case giver should be aloof and mention that you do not have data on that subject. That should bring the candidate back to the cost/benefit track.\n2. Cost-benefit analysis details\nI. Costs\nThe candidate may want to start with benefits first. The interviewer should direct them to start with costs first. Costs are more interesting in terms of dissecting a graph, and for benefits the interviewer can give candidate answers easily without requiring diving into calculations if time is running short.\nInterviewer: Ask the candidate to brainstorm on what costs could occur. Let them generate 4-5 ideas, then ask which is likely to be the greatest cost and why. Then, dive into details.\nPresent the candidate the “General Information” slide (Exhibit 1) for cost discussion. You could say: Let’s examine the cost of rolling out RFID to individual super stores and distribution centers (DCs).\nKmart – General Information (Exhibit 1. slide to give to candidate)\n30 Super Stores and 3 Distribution Centers (DCs)\n\n\n\n\nSuper Store\nDistribution Center\n\n\nFinancial\n\n\n\n\nSales/year\n$50M\n\n\n\nCOGS\n($39.4M)\n\n\n\nTotal assets\n$3M\n$8M\n\n\nTotal inventory\n$1.5M\n$5M\n\n\nOperational\n\n\n\n\nSize\n100,000 sq ft\n400,000 sq ft\n\n\nSKUs (unique products)\n50,000\n225,000\n\n\n# of Employees\n100\n300\n\n\nAverage employee wage\n$20,000/year\n$20,000/year\n\n\n\n*Note: all values are average per Store or per Distribution Center\nInterviewer: Our client Kmart’s Strategic Planning Team worked closely with the IT department and came up with the following chart to determine how many receivers, which will read the RFID tags, to install in super stores. (Show Exhibit 2. “Kmart Super Store Receiver Layout” to candidate).\nExhibit 2. Kmart Super Store Receiver Layout\nThe following chart depicts the recommended RFID receiver layout for a standard Kmart Super Store. To simplify analysis, store layout has been abstracted to high-level blocks, with each block having a specific level of traffic.\n\nChart Legend\nLow density – 4 receivers/10,000 sq ft\nMedium density – 10 receivers/10,000 sq ft\nHigh density – 20 receivers/10,000 sq ft\nInterviewer:\n\nWhat does this chart indicate? (Wait for candidate’s answer; guide them if necessary).\nWith this, can you determine the cost of rolling out RFID receivers to super stores?\nWhat are you missing? (Let the candidate compute; the candidate should realize that he/she is missing information about the cost of RFID receivers, wiring, and systems).\n\n The cost of each RFID receiver, including all wiring and systems, is $100 per receiver.\n\n\nNow, what is the cost of rolling out the receiver to all super stores? (Let the candidate compute).\nExpected candidate math:\n\n First, compute number of receivers per 10,000 square feet Store space: 4/low * 2 low + 10/medium * 5 medium + 20/high * 2 high = 8 + 50 + 40 = 98/10,000 sq ft.\n Second, compute cost of receivers per Store: $100/receiver * 100,000 sq ft per store * 98/10,000 sq ft = ~$100,000/store\n Third, compute cost of receivers in all 30 super stores: $100,000/store * 30 stores = $3 million\n\n\n\nInterviewer: Now, let’s look at the Distribution Centers. (Show Exhibit 3. “Kmart Distribution Center Receiver Layout” to candidate). Let’s again assume that the total cost per RFID receiver, including all wiring and systems costs, is $100 per receiver.\nExhibit 3. Kmart Distribution Center Receiver Layout\nThe following chart depicts the recommended RFID receiver layout for a standard Kmart Distribution Center. To simplify analysis, distribution center layout has been abstracted to high-level blocks, with each block having a specific level of traffic.\n\nChart Legend\nLow density – 4 receivers/10,000 sq ft\nMedium density – 10 receivers/10,000 sq ft\nHigh density – 20 receivers/10,000 sq ft\n\nWhat is the cost of rolling out to all Distribution Centers? (Let them compute).\nExpected candidate math:\n\n First, compute number receivers per 10,000 square feet DC space: 4/low * 3 low + 10/medium * 5 medium + 20/high * 1 high = 12 + 50 + 20 = 82 receivers/10,000 sq ft.\n Second, compute cost of receivers per DC: $100/receiver * 400,000 sq ft * 82/10,000 sq ft = ~$330,000/DC\n Third, compute cost of receivers in all 3 DCs: $330,000/DC * 3 DCs = ~$1 million\n\n\n\nInterviewer: There will be an additional one-time cost of $8M for developing supporting computer systems and training, in the first year. In addition, the cost of yearly maintenance will be $3M/year.\nExpected candidate math (Note: a great candidate will summarize costs this way before moving onto benefits):\n\nOne-time costs: $8M (systems & training) + $3M (receivers in stores) + $1M (receivers in DCs) = $12M\nYearly costs = $3M\n\nII. Benefits\nInterviewer: Ask the candidate to brainstorm on what benefits could occur. Let them generate 4-5 ideas, then ask which is likely to be the greatest benefit and why. Then, dive into details.\nThe candidate should come up with some of the following answers. These are lumped into three main categories. Feel free to group their suggestions into one of the following, or say “that’s not applicable/relevant to this case” if not classifiable.\nNote: their framework may say Revenue/cost instead of Benefit/cost. If so, feel free to tell them that the following benefits are effects on contribution to fixed cost, as opposed to revenue. They should realize that we are not dealing with revenue directly in this case, but rather focusing on cost and on contribution.\na. Reduction in out-of-stock; Reduction in theft (both in-store and in distribution).\n\n Interviewer: Sales are projected to increase 0.1% a year as a result of the RFID technology.\n Expected candidate math: $50M sales/store/year (from General Information slide) * 30 stores = $1.5B/year sales, $1.5B/year * 0.1% = additional $1.5M/year contribution.\n\nb. Better inventory management; Faster cross-docking distribution.\n\nInterviewer: There is a one-time savings of 5% on total inventory once the distribution process has been re-engineered. Assume that this happens within the first year.\nExpected candidate math:\n\n First, compute total inventory: inventory = $1.5M/store * 30 stores + $5M/DC * 3 DCs (all #s from General Information slide) = $45M + $15M = $60M\n Next, compute one-time savings: $60M * 5% = $3M one time contribution.\n Note to interviewer: This is a really complicated calculation; if running out of time (especially with 1/2 hour interview), feel free to directly give this number to the candidate.\n\n\n\nc. Reduced in-store and warehouse labor; Faster checkout in store.\n\nInterviewer: We expect a decrease in Store and DC labor cost of 5% per year.\nExpected candidate math:\n\n First, determine total store and DC labor cost: labor = $20K/store employee * 100 employees/store * 30 stores + $20K/DC employee * 300 employees/DC * 3 stores = $60M + $18M = $78M ~= $80M/year (expect rounding)\n Second, determine yearly cost decrease: $80M/year * 5% = $4M/year.\n Note to interviewer: This is a really complicated calculation; if running out of time (especially with 1/2 hour interview), feel free to directly give this number to the candidate.\n\n\n\nd. Total benefits\nExpected candidate math (Note: a great candidate will summarize benefits this way before moving away from benefit/cost analysis):\n\n One-time benefits: $3M (better inventory management & faster cross-docking)\n Yearly benefits: $1.5M (reduction in out-of-stock & reduction in theft) + $4M (reduction in labor & faster checkout) = $5.5M\n\nNote: the candidate is expected to set up a data table like the one below, as it directly answers whether the client Kmart should consider this new technology proposal as-is.\n\n\n\nYear\nYear 1\nYear 2\nYear 3\nYear 4\n\n\nCost\n12 + 3 = 15\n3\n3\n3\n\n\nBenefit\n3 + 5.5 = 8.5\n5.5\n5.5\n5.5\n\n\nNet (year)\n8.5 – 15 = -6.5\n5.5 – 3 = 2.5\n5.5 – 3 = 2.5\n5.5 – 3 = 2.5\n\n\nNet (cumulative)\n-6.5\n-6.5 + 2.5 = -4\n-4 + 2.5 = -1.5\n-1.5 + 2.5 = 1\n\n\n\n(All values in $Millions)\n3. Risks to accepting technology\nIf the candidate determined (through incorrect math) that the client Kmart should accept the technology as-is, they should begin to brainstorm risks. Here are some examples; the more descriptive their risks, the less a math error should be held against them (especially if most of the math was correct):\n\nTechnology risk: RFID is a rapidly changing technology. If Kmart makes a decision on one non-standard technology type, that type may be phased out of the market if a different type is chosen as a standard.\nBudget risk: Massive projects are inherently difficult, and as a result the project may surpass budget. Depending on candidate’s calculations, there should be little leeway between recouping expenditures and not recouping expenditures by year 4.\nAssumptions risk: There were many assumptions that were made, that could easily be incorrect.\nGrowth/shrink risk: how do costs scale if company grows or shrinks?\nOther risks: let the candidate be creative.\n\n4. Alternatives to the proposed plan\n\n Start small: instead of instituting a full roll-out on every products and every store, stage the rollout based on geography or sales category.\n Distribution first, then retail: focus on implementing RFID for distribution as first phase of plan, then on retail enhancement for second phase. Two separate phases will allow two separate periods to recoup expenditure.\n Others: let the candidate be creative.\n\n5. Summary\nInterviewer: Give the candidates 2 minutes to create summary and summarize their findings at the end of case.\nNote: If the interview is given only 30 minutes, do not expect anyone to finish the case in full. Just ensure that the candidate summarizes what has been discussed and gives a strong statement as to whether he/she believes the client should pursue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "url": "http://www.consultingcase101.com/exxonmobil-to-attach-more-grocery-stores-to-gas-stations/",
        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: business competition, competitive response.\nConsulting Firm: Schlumberger Business Consulting (SBC) first round summer internship job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: oil, gas & petroleum industry.\nCase Interview Question #00663: Your client Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) or ExxonMobil, is an American multinational oil and gas company headquartered in Irving, Texas, United States. Formed in November 1999 through the merger of Exxon and Mobil, ExxonMobil is now the largest of the six oil supermajors in the world (BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Total S.A., ConocoPhillips).\nCurrently ExxonMobil is the biggest downstream gas operator in the United States, i.e., it operates the largest number of retail gas stations. The downstream oil sector is a term commonly used to refer to the selling and distribution of natural gas and petrol products derived from crude oil, such as gasoline, jet fuel, diesel oil, etc.\nIn the last three years, the oil & gas retail industry has been liberalized and several new competitors have entered the market. In particular, one competitor Gulf Oil Company has been extremely aggressive in the market. In fact, they have from the very start charged a lower price for gas than our client even though the client ExxonMobil is the biggest player in the market. This has caused our client’s market share to erode. How is the competitor able to do this? What should our client do to mitigate competitive actions?\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate: Interesting case. My first instinct is to understand why the competitor Gulf Oil has been able to charge a lower price than us. I will need to know the prices my client ExxonMobil and the competitor Gulf Oil are charging. I also would want to understand the client’s cost structure and our competitor’s cost structure. To begin, what are the prices charged by  the two companies?\nInterviewer: Assume that our client’s gas price per gallon is $3.75 while the competitor’s is $3.15.\nCandidate: OK, then to understand the cost structure, it will be useful to use the value chain framework. The value chain is comprised of largely two segments: the first is the delivery of oil through pipes and oil trucks; the second is operation of the petrol stations. I would assume that there is no difference between our client’s and the competitor’s cost in oil delivery. Do we have a figure for this cost?\nInterviewer: Yes, the client ExxonMobil has told you the delivery cost is approximately $1.50 per gallon.\nCandidate: For the petrol station operations, are there any big differences? What are the hours of operation of our client’s gas stations versus the competitor’s?\nInterviewer: The main difference is that our competitor Gulf Oil’s gas stations do not operate between the hours of 1am and 5am, while our client operates 24 hours a day.\nCandidate: Then that would mean a greater cost to our client than the competitors in operations. Do we have a figure for the cost to our client for operations?\nInterviewer: Yes, it’s about $2.10 per gallon for our client, and about $0.30-$0.35 cheaper for the competitor’s.\nCandidate: OK, then rounding to $2.10 – $0.30 = $1.80 per gallon for the competitor’s operating cost and $1.50 per gallon for their delivery cost, the total cost per gallon for the competitor is around $1.80 + $1.50 = $3.30, which is higher than the price that they charge of $3.15. Our client’s total cost per gallon is $2.10 + $1.50 = $3.60, which is lower than the gas price of $3.75.\nThe next step is to understand why the competitor is undercharging. Is the competitor losing money deliberately in order to gain market share?\nInterviewer: No, it has been doing this for the last three years and has been making money actually.\nCandidate: That would lead me to believe the competitor is making money from other offerings than gas sales. Perhaps it has a snack or grocery shop or some other items to sell. Is that the case?\nInterviewer: Yes. Other profits come from the sale of groceries & snacks from the gas station’s mini-mart or convenience stores. For every gallon of gas that it sells, it makes $0.50 in other profits.\nCandidate: What about our client? Do they have other sources of revenue?\nInterviewer: Our client’s gas stations has only a few vending machines from which it earns about $0.06 in profit for every gallon of gas sold.\nCandidate: This means that the competitor’s strategy is to reduce the price of oil to attract customers who will purchase more profitable snack & grocery items. My initial recommendation would be for our client ExxonMobil to also embark on such a strategy: attach convenience stores and mini grocery stores to their gas stations and include grocery, food, drinks, and snack items in their convenience stores.\nInterviewer: Excellent! Let’s stop here. Thank you for your analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "title": "Siemens Buys Bayer Diagnostics & Diagnostic Products Corp.",

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: merger & acquisition (M&A).\nConsulting Firm: Siemens Management Consulting first round job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: healthcare: hospital & medical; conglomerate.\nCase Interview Question #00629: The client Siemens AG (FWB: SIE, NYSE: SI) is a German multinational engineering and electronics conglomerate company headquartered in Munich, Germany. It is the largest Europe-based electronics and electrical engineering company. Siemens’ principal activities are in the fields of industry, energy, transportation and healthcare. It is organized into five main sectors: Industry, Energy, Healthcare, Infrastructure & Cities, and Siemens Financial Services (SFS).\nFor the sake of this case, we will be talking about Siemens’ Healthcare sector only. The year was 2006. Siemens just made 2 simultaneous acquisitions in order to fill a void in their product portfolio in the area of diagnostics instruments.\n\nFirm 1 is Bayer Diagnostics with $1.4 billion in revenue per year.\nFirm 2 is Diagnostic Products Corp. (DPC) with $300 million in revenue per year.\n\nBoth firms would be incorporated into the Medical Solutions Diagnostics division of Siemens on January 1st, 2007. What are some of the things the client Siemens should consider during the post-merger integration phase of these two acquisitions?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate if requested)\n1. Products\n\nBoth Bayer Diagnostics and Diagnostic Products Corp. (DPC) produce automated lab testing systems that use reagents to perform routine diagnostics tests.\nDPC focuses on very expensive, high quality equipment that costs around $1.5 million per machine.\nBayer Diagnostics sells the cheapest products in the industry at about $350,000 per machine and focuses on high sales volume.\nBayer Diagnostics’ machines can test for fewer conditions but has 8 times the throughput of DPC’s machines.\nOverall, in this industry, the profits come from the reagents, not the machines (think of it as a razor and blade model)\n\n2. Customers\n\nBecause of the price, DPC’s primary customers are large hospitals. Bayer Diagnostics sells to private practices and small hospitals.\nBayer Diagnostics has 15 times as many sales agents as DPC.\n\n3. Geography\n\nDPC has 3 plants\n\n New Jersey plant produces machines\n LA and Wales plants produce reagents\n\n\nBayer Diagnostics has 3 plants\n\n Dublin plant produces machines\n Massachusetts and London plants produce reagents\n\n\n\nPossible Answer:\nThis case is intended to be very conversational without a rigid direction; the candidate needs to demonstrate that they can think of all the important areas to consider after a post merger.\nWe need to start by understanding what are the products that each of the two companies are producing and how these products are going to be integrated in the mother company.\nThe main focus will be in trying to consolidate as many functions as possible in order to save some money and to use the distribution channels from each company to try to increase the revenues.\n\n We need to understand the markets in which these products are playing and look at the customer base.\n We would also need to look at the location of the plants and the distance between these plants and the customers of each company.\n\nFinally another thing that needs attention is the cultural aspect of the integration. We should assess how close or different the cultures of the two firms are and how easy it will be for them to integrate into one company.\nThe candidate should focus on identifying possible functions to consolidate and make sure the consolidation of functions will play a very important role in the success of the integration.\nHere is a sample solution:\n1. Procurement\n\n There is likely some cost benefit in buying a larger amount of inputs to both the machines and the reagents\n\n2. Manufacturing\n\n Several of the plants are in high labor cost areas\n The manufacturing techniques are likely similar, some plants can certainly be closed if utilization is not too high\n Topics such as total cost of manufacturing, utilization rates, and scale economies should be discussed\n\n3. Sales force\n\n This is an important point; from the additional information given, it should be clear that the compensation structure and customer relationships for the 2 firms are very different. How should these be combined? And specifically, how can it be done without alienating the higher compensated, but likely higher performing, DPC sales force?\n\n4. Culture\n\n DPC is far more entrepreneurial. They will likely be concerned about being swallowed up by the much large Bayer.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The company provides asset management and financial services to high net worth individuals and institutional investors, pension and profit sharing plans, banking and thrift institutions, investment companies, pooled investment vehicles, charitable organizations, corporations, and state and municipal government entities. With approximately $200 billion in asset under management (AUM), it is among the largest private employee-controlled asset management firms in the world.\nThe CEO of Neuberger Berman Group is concerned with his firm’s flat revenues and profits during the recent years. We have been asked to help them to remedy this condition. How would you think about this problem?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate upon request)\n1. Revenue:\n\n $2 billion in annual revenue based on 1% management fee of $200 billion of assets under management (AUM)\n\n2. Costs:\n\n Overhead: $200 million\n Money management: $800 million, 50% based on assets\n Distribution / brokers: $800 million, 100% based on assets, i.e. 40% commission of total revenue. All sales are made through independent brokers (they also sell funds from other asset management companies).\n\n3. Fund Strategy:\n\n Focused on US equities market only\n\nPossible Solution:\nA good brainstorm should include discussions on the following elements:\n\nRevenues\nCosts\nRegulatory environment, e.g. restrictions on management fees, etc.\nCompetition: currently there is increased competition in funds and wealth management\nDistribution environment, e.g. the emergence of online brokerage\n\nQuestion #2: At what level of assets will our client begin to lose money? (This is a question of fixed and variable costs)\nPossible Solution:\n\nCurrently our client’s fund has a $200 million in general overhead; I assume that is not going to change with AUM size.\nThe brokers are paid purely on commission, so all of their costs are variable.\nThe fund managers are paid 50% on commission, meaning $400 million are fixed.\nTotal fixed costs = $200 million + $400 million = $600 million\n\nTherefore, at a 1% management fee, we need a minimum of $60 billion in assets under management to cover our total fixed costs.\nQuestion #3: Based on what you have found, what would you recommend to the fund manager?\nPossible Solution:\n\nWe need to look at ways to drive revenue first. We could change the incentive structure for the money managers, adjusted more to the fund’s performance.\nWith the brokers, we could pay them a higher commission to try to encourage them to sell our fund over another (we would have to tease out the quantity/price relationship to see if this makes sense.\nThere probably is not much to gain with overhead.\nAdditionally, this is a US fund only. We should consider launching an additional fund, perhaps focusing on international markets, to drive up revenues and leverage our brand.\nWe are a $200 billion fund – we probably have a strong brand that we could use to sell more to our existing customers (i.e. new fund) and possibly bring in new customers as well.\nLook into new distribution methods\nLook into asking brokers to do cold calls\nHave the brokers in house. This will increase fixed costs but might provide better productivity.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

DCF conducts its own interview or investigation into the allegations. DCF talks to caretakers of children whenever there have been allegations of abuse or neglect. After its investigation, the agency decides what, if any, services the family needs.\nRecently, the Massachusetts state legislature passed a law that will change the DCF agency’s funding structure. Previously, the agency had been funded at a fixed dollar amount every year. Now, under the new law, the DCF agency will be paid according to performance, as measured by the number of interviews or investigations they conduct with the caretakers of children in the state.\nThe DCF agency has hired your consulting firm to determine how the change of funding structure will affect them and what they should do about it.\nPossible Solution:\nInterviewer: So, how would you go about this case?\nInterviewee: Before we going into the problem of the case, I would like to understand how this Department of Children and Families agency is functioning, what are the main activities that are performed by the agency.\nInterviewer: For the purpose of simplicity, let’s assume that the agency’s only activity is conducting interviews.\nInterviewee: I would start by looking at the funding process and here I would like to first understand how the agency was previously funded, then I would like to look at the new funding procedure and how the change between the two is going to affect them. After identifying the effect, we can look into ways to improve the current status and other options to get funding.\nInterviewer: Sounds like a plan, go ahead please.\nInterviewee: How was the agency previously funded?\nInterviewer: Previously, the agency received $50,000 per employee per year from the Massachusetts state government.\nInterviewee: How much of that money went to agency employee’s salary and how much to overhead and other costs?\nInterviewer: On average $30,000 went to salary and $20,000 went to overhead\nInterviewee: How many employees does the agency have?\nInterviewer: We don’t know. This case can be solved on a per-employee basis.\nInterviewee: All right, how will now the agency be funded?\nInterviewer: Now the agency will be paid $25 per interview.\nInterviewee: How many interviews does each DCF social worker conduct per day?\nInterviewer: Currently each social worker conducts an average of 5 interviews per day.\nInterviewee: Assuming 50 work weeks per year, 5 word days per week, we will have 250 work days a year.\n250 work days per year * 5 interviews per day * $25 per interview = $31,250 per year\nThat is the agency continues to operate as it has been; in this case the agency will incur a $50,000 – $31,250 = $18,750 per employee per year budget shortfall.\nThey should try to find ways to close this funding gap, either by boosting revenues (e.g. increase the number of interviews, seek other funding sources) or by cutting existing costs.\nInterviewer: Sounds good.\nInterviewee: Can the agency increase the number of interviews it conducts per social worker per day?\nInterviewer: Under the current system, the agency could boost the number of interviews from 5 to 6 per day.\nInterviewee: OK, if DCF can increase the number of interviews from 5 to 6 per day, they will have\n250 work days per year * 6 interviews per day * $25 per interview = $37,500 per year\nThis will bring the shortfall in revenues to $50,000 – $37,500 = $12,500 per employee per year\nHow long does it currently take to conduct an interview?\nInterviewer: It takes one hour; 40 minutes of which is the interview and 20 minutes is follow-up data entry and report\nInterviewee: It seems to me that it takes a lot of time to enter the data in the system. Is there any way to reduce this 20 min, say using a better note-taking technology for example?\nInterviewer: The agency has found a very inexpensive transcription software program that would allow them to cut the 20 minutes to 10.\nInterviewee: Great, 10 minutes saved per interview * 6 interviews per day = 60 minutes saved in a day.\nThis will provide an extra interview per day => 250 work days per year * 7 interviews per day * $25 per interview = $43,750 per year\nThis will bring the gap to $50,000 – $43,750 = $6,250 per employee per year\nInterviewer: There is no other way to squeeze more interviews in a day.\nInterviewee: What about exploring a private charitable funding?\nInterviewer: Well, the agency can garner $1,000 per employee per year from a private charitable trust.\nInterviewee: In that case it still leaves us with a gap of $5,250 per employee per year. I would continue now by looking into ways to reduce costs. And I would especially look into trying to reduce overhead cost. Can the agency merge some of its facilities usage with other state agencies to reduce overhead costs?\nInterviewer: Yes, the DCF agency can consolidate its offices into other state agency buildings at a savings of $4,000 per employee per year.\nInterviewee: OK, we are now at $1,250 gap per employee per year. Are all social workers paid evenly? If not, maybe we can reduce the salaries of the higher paid employees.\nInterviewer: No and Yes. Actually, 30% of the social workers are paid only $25,000 a year, 40% are paid $30,000 per year, and 30% are paid $35,000 per year. We’ve determined that the agency can convert half of the workers at the highest pay grade to the lowest pay grade.\nInterviewee: OK, so the new salary structure will be:\n\n45% at $25K/year\n40% at $30K/year\n15% at $35K/year\n\nSavings will be 15% *($35K – $25K) = $1,500 per employee per year\nInterviewer: Good. Let’s wrap it up here. So, what is your conclusion?\nInterviewee: (a good candidate will now summarize the case and will provide recommendations) The funding change will result in a budget shortfall of $18,750 per employee per year if we continue to operate as we have been.\nHere are my recommendations for closing the budget gap:\nClosing the gap by increasing revenue:\n\n Without any operational changes, we can boost the number of daily interviews from 5 to 6 per employee.\n By instituting a simple transcription service we can increase that number to 7. This will increase revenues by $12,500, closing the gap to $6,250.\n Additional charitable funding will give us $1,000 per employee per year, closing the gap to $5,250.\n\nClosing the gap by decreasing costs:\n\n Consolidating our offices, facilities and overhead with other state agencies will save us $4,000 per employee per year.\n Staffing restructuring will save us an additional $1,500 per employee per year.\n\nThis will actually bring $250 additional revenue per employee per year. Some of it will pay for the new IT system.\nInterviewer: Excellent!\nNote:\nThe key to this case is figuring out how the funding change will affect the agency, then identifying the issues resulting from the change. A strong candidate will first try to understand the agency’s previous funding structure, then ask about the new funding structure, then recognize that the agency will experience a budget shortfall, then make data-driven recommendations for closing the budget shortfall.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. (SIX: ROG) is a global health care group company that operates worldwide under two divisions: Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics. With its headquarter located in Basel, Switzerland, the company has many pharmaceutical and diagnostic sites around the world, including the US, Canada, UK, Ireland, Germany, Italy, Brazil, China, India, Pakistan, etc. Roche’s revenues during fiscal year 2010 were Swiss franc 47.49 billion.\nRecently, the management of Roche is thinking of acquiring Genentech Inc., another biotechnology and pharmaceutical company located in San Francisco, California, United States. Genentech markets itself as a research-driven corporation that follows the science to make innovations. They employ more than 1,100 researchers, scientists and postdocs and cover a wide range of scientific activity. Currently the focus of their efforts is on five disease categories: Oncology, Immunology, Tissue Growth and Repair, Neuroscience and Infectious Disease.\nThe CEO of Roche has hired us to advise whether they should acquire the Genentech company or not.\nQuestion #1: What are the key areas to investigate in order to determine whether the acquisition is a good idea or not?\nPossible Solution:\nA good answer will identify the following issues:\n\nFirst I would need to understand the rationale for the acquisition, that can be for:\n\nacquiring resources (increase capacity, increase distribution, broaden product line, technology, human capital, R&D, brand name, customer base) or\ncost reduction (economies of scale, economies of scope).\n\n\nIt is very important that the acquisition makes sense economically (having a positive NPV), but we also need to look into the organizational issues (will potential synergies be realized, is the firm in the position to perform the integration).\nIn addition, I would assess the geographic differences of the two companies under discussion.\nFinally I would look into the likely response of competitors if the acquisition occurs and maybe alternatives to acquisition and compare it to the acquisition itself (other acquisition targets? organic growth instead of acquisition?)\n\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate upon request)\nPurpose of the acquisition: increase profits\n\n The San Francisco company Genentech currently has 9 drugs in the market\n Both companies (Roche and Genentech) are selling their products globally\n The R&D department of Genentech is based in the same location with the HQ (San Francisco)\n Revenues from an approved drug of the San Francisco based company Genentech is USD $170 million\n\nDrug authorization success rate for Genentech (show the following chart to the candidate)\n\n\n Out of all the drugs under Phase 1 clinical trial, 30% will move on to Phase 2\n Out of all the Phase 2 drugs, 40% will move on to Phase 3\n 70% of the drugs under Phase 3 clinical trial will receive FDA approval\n Of the drugs that receive FDA approval, 90% will be actually launched to the market\n\nQuestion #2: We just discovered that Genentech can improve the yield from Phase 2 to Phase 3 by investing $500 million in the R&D technology. By how much should the yield increase so as to break even?\nPossible Solution:\nBefore the new technology, Genentech has 9 drugs in the market, it means:\n\n FDA approval: 9 / 90% = 10 drugs\n Phase 3: 10 / 70% ~= 15 drugs\n Phase 2: 15 / 40% = 38 drugs\n Phase 1: 38 / 30% = 127 drugs\n\nTo break even, the extra R&D cost needs to be equal to the revenue from extra drugs launched to market because of the new technology. Assume that the present value of launching a new drug is $170 million. To cover the $500 million extra costs, Genentech needs to launch $500 / $170 = 3 more drugs so as to have 12 drugs in the market.\n\n FDA approval: 12 / 90% = 13 drugs\n Phase 3: 13 / 70% = 17 drugs\n The success rate from Phase 2 to Phase 3 must be: 19 / 38 = 50%\n\nIt means that the yield should increase by approximately 50% / 40% – 1 = 125% – 1 = 25%\nQuestion #3: What are the potential risks involved with this acquisition?\nPossible Answer:\nThe candidate should be able to recognize the different risks involved, including\n\nthe strategic rationale\nlikely response of competitors if acquisition occurs\norganizational issues: different locations for the HQ, integration of the two organizations\nprofitability of the acquisition (NPV calculation)\nalternatives to the acquisition\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: merger and acquisition (M&A).\nConsulting Firm: L.E.K. Consulting first round summer internship job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: entertainment.\nCase Interview Question #00619: Our client UCI Cinemas (United Cinemas International) is a brand of cinema chain, currently operating in Austria, Germany, Republic of Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Brazil. The chain is owned by Odeon & UCI Cinemas Group whose ultimate parent is leading U.K. based private equity firm Terra Firma Capital Partners.\nCurrently UCI Cinemas has several movie theaters located in Rome and Milan. The CEO of UCI Cinemas is planning to expand the chain in Florence (Italian: Firenze), a city with a population of 370,000. He has found an interesting theater in the center of Florence that would sell for €2.5 million. “Cinema Firenze” has only one room that holds 400 seats and is open 50 weeks a year. The theater runs 4 shows  per day in mid-week and 6 shows per day during the weekend.\nThe CEO of UCI Cinemas has retained your consulting firm to understand if they should go through with the acquisition. What would you tell him? What factors would you consider?\nPossible Solution:\nUltimately the decision of whether to go with the acquisition falls on the projected profitability of the acquisition target Cinema Firenze. “Profits = Revenues – Costs” seems the most useful framework here in this case.\nAn ideal candidate will be able to list the main drivers of revenue and cost streams. An outstanding candidate will also  drive the analysis and make reasonable assumptions over revenue and cost drivers. He or she should also understand what possible synergies might be exploited.\nInterviewer: So, tell me how would you approach this decision?\nCandidate: May I ask why the client UCI Cinemas wants to buy this new theater in Florence?\nInterviewer: What do you think?\nCandidate: I guess that our client wants to acquire this movie theater in Florence so to increase the overall profits of its business, but there may be other important reasons for this decision.\nInterviewer: Of course, there are other important aspects to consider such as the brand image, geographic expansion, etc. But for now let’s stick with the profitability analysis.\nCandidate: Thanks. In order to estimate the value of the investment I need to estimate the annual cash flow of Cinema Firenze and the trends. Since profits = revenues – cost, my first breakdown of the problem is the analysis of sales and cost.\nInterviewer: OK. Let’s start with the revenue side of the equations. What do you think are the major source of revenues of this cinema?\nCandidate: The major sources of revenues of a cinema are tickets sales and concessions. The movie theater can also make money advertising before films.\nInterviewer: Perfect, first let’s concentrate now on ticket sales. How much do you think that is?\nCandidate: Revenues from tickets sales can be calculated from the average price time estimated number of tickets sold per year.\nInterviewer: What information do you need to calculate that?\nCandidate: I need to know the average ticket price and the numbers of clients per year.\nInterviewer: Correct. For the sake of simplicity, let’s assume that the average ticket price is €8. Now, how would you calculate the number of tickets sold per year?\nCandidate: In order to calculate the tickets sold every year we need to know how many shows we have in one year, the average utilization and the capacity of the cinema. In order to make our approach more accurate I intended to analyze separately weekend utilization from weekday utilization. I will estimate both.\nInterviewer: OK, how would you calculate this average utilization?\nCandidate: Assuming that we have:\n\n\n\n\nShows/day\nDays\nNumber of shows\nUtilization\n\n\nWeekday\n4\n5\n20\n20%\n\n\nWeekend\n6\n2\n12\n40%\n\n\nWeighted Average Utilization\n\n\n\n27.5%\n\n\n\nThe utilization is the weighted average of weekday and weekend utilization.\nWeighted average utilization = (20% * 20 + 40% * 12) / (20 + 12) = 27.5%\nInterviewer: How would you verify if this estimated utilization is correct?\nCandidate: I would compare it with one of our client’s theaters in Milan or Rome.\nInterviewer: OK, consider that the most successful movie theater in Rome, “L’Adriano” has an average of 35% utilization over the year.\nCandidate: Then I’d say that and estimated 27.5% utilization for a famous theater in Florence is plausible.\nThat gives an average ticket sale of 400 * 27.5% = 110 tickets per show. There are 32 shows per week, 50 weeks/year, 110 tickets per show, which makes a total of 32 * 50 * 110 = 176,000 tickets per year.\nWith €8.00 per ticket we have a total annual revenue of approximately 176,000 * €8.00 = €1.4 million from tickets sales.\nInterviewer: OK, let’s now calculate the revenues from advertising. Please make assumptions.\nCandidate: I would say the revenues from ads are proportional to traffic or sales. Let’s assume €4 per ticket sold, which gives 176,000 * €4 = €700,000.\nInterviewer: That’s fair. What about concessions?\nCandidate: I assume the concession stand will sell to 40% of customers, at an average price of €3/sale, so it’s going to be: 176,000 * 40% * €3 = €211,000 per year. Do we know the margin on those purchases?\nInterviewer: It’s very high, assume 90%.\nCandidate: So net profits from the concession stand are 90% of €211,000 = €190,000. Summing it all up, total revenues are 1,400,000 + 700,000 + 190,000 = €2,290,000.\nInterviewer: Good. I’ll give you some information for the cost side of the equations:\n\n10 people working at the cinema for an average annual salary of €60,000 each\nOperating expenses €250,000 per year\nFilm fee: 50% of ticket sales\nRent: €40 per square meter per month, total area 1,000 square meters\n\nCandidate: So the costs per year are:\n\nPersonnel: 10 * €60,000 = €600,000\nOperating expenses: €250,000\nFilm fees: 50% of €1,400,000 = €700,000\nRent: €1,000 * 40 * 12 months = €480,000\nTotal costs. €600,000 + €250,000 + €700,000 + €480,000 = €2,030,000\nProfit before taxes = €2,290,000 – €2,030,000 = €260,000\n\nAssuming 30% in taxes, net income is about €260,000 * (1 – 30%) = €182,000\nInterviewer: Correct. Is it a good business?\nCandidate: I would say, €2.5 million for a yearly profit of €182,000 per year is not a fair price. With an interest rate of 10%, we need at least €250,000/year of cash flow. I would strongly advise against this acquisition.\nInterviewer: But, how do you know it’s not a good business? What’s the percentage over sales?\nCandidate: €182,000 / €2,290,000 = 7.9%, it’s about 8%, but I wouldn’t acquire the business for €2.5 million, which was our primary question. Anyhow, we own several movie theaters; we should compare our results with these numbers we just found to understand if it’s a solid business in itself.\nInterviewer: Exactly, that is the point. The CEO is aware that 8% is a low figure, but he is a very stubborn person and says he wants to acquire this theater anyway. What’s the course of action?\nCandidate: Well, if the CEO is set to buy anyway, he should:\n\nBargain over the price\nUnderstand possible synergies that might increase profitability\n\nInterviewer: Right, I’d suggest haggling too, and how would you make this business more profitable?\nCandidate: Profit is revenues (volume and price) minus costs. Off the top of my head, we could try the following ways:\n\ninvest to increase the volume of purchases,\nstart a marketing campaign,\ndevise partnerships with local shops to publicize their product in exchange of increased visibility for our shows,\nfind out if we’re airing the right movies for the local clientele,\nlower prices to drive business for unpopular show times.\n\nInterviewer: OK, all good ideas, and what on the costs side?\nCandidate: If we acquired this business, we could bargain the fees as a movie theater chain rather than a single interlocutor and could leverage our increased bargaining power against film distributors.\nInterviewer: That is correct. Thanks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

As a national monthly magazine, Allure focuses on beauty, fashion, and women’s health. The magazine’s circulation, initially 250,000 in 1991, is over 1 million as of 2011.\nRecently, Conde Nast, the publisher of Allure Magazine, wants to restructure its printing division. They currently have 2 facilities where they print their magazines and want to move to only one facility. Conde Nast has hired us to tell them if this is a good idea or not. How would you go about analyzing this case?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate upon request)\n\nTotal number of magazines they sell per month: 1 million\nLocations of the two printing facilities: one in Idaho and one in New Jersey\nBoth facilities can accommodate the total number of magazines they need. They each currently print 50% of the total magazines.\n\nCost structure:\n\n Total Costs = $1.50/unit\n Fixed costs = $0.70/unit\nMoving to one facility would save 20% of the fixed costs\nThe move would increase the distribution costs:\n\n moving to New Jersey : by $0.04/unit\nmoving to Idaho: by $0.16/unit\n\n\n\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate: I have a question before going further with the case. What is the reason behind the magazine publisher’s decision to restructure the printing division?\nInterviewer: the main reason is reduction of costs.\nCandidate: OK. In order to assess the validity of their idea, I would start by looking into the cost structure of the company, specifically for the printing division. I would assess both the fixed and variable costs involved.\nThen I would like to identify the cost savings that a consolidation of printing facilities would give to the company, and whether the company has the capability to do the consolidation both in terms of capacity or infrastructure involved by such a transition (distribution, operations, and feasibility of the move).\nFinally, I would like to assess the risks involved (regulations, market situation, etc).\nThe interviewer should now direct the candidate to answer the following question: What will be the total cost per unit after the consolidation? What facility should they keep if at all?\nPossible Solution:\nSavings in the fixed costs: 20% * $0.70/unit = $0.14/unit\nIncreases in costs from distribution:\n\n New Jersey: -$0.04c/unit\n Idaho: -$0.16/unit\n\nTotal savings:\n\n New Jersey: $0.14 – $0.04 = $0.10/unit\n Idaho: $0.14 – $0.16 = -$0.02/unit\n\nTherefore, they should choose the New Jersey facility.\nThe interviewer should then ask the following question: What are the risks involved in moving to only one printing facility?\nPossible Solution:\n\nunemployment rate in New Jersey\nlocal regulations by state government\noperational cost: gas price\ndelivery time\ncost of closing the other facility in Idaho\ncost of materials\nfuture increases in sales\n\nA good candidate will make a final recommendation in the end, like\nI suggest they close the Idaho printing facility because the New Jersey one offers them the best cost per unit. However, they need to understand that there are other things to consider when taking this decision as the ones I mentioned in the risks involved.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

In addition to identifying the cause of declining profits, you also need to give recommendations and assist them through the implementation process. How would you to about this case?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate if requested)\nBesides the regular product/service provided by an internet cafe (like emails, web surfing, video games), Busy Internet also offers a range of other related services:\n\na business incubator service\nISP, Internet Service Provider (broadband, dial-up, wireless, satellite, and radio connection)\nCopy Center, equipped with printers, copiers, scanners, etc.\nConference Room\nOffice Renting\n\nSuggested Approach:\nThe purpose of this case is to asses the candidates’ analytical skills and his/her abilities of gathering information through appropriate questions. A good understanding of the Ghanaian business climate is important but not a must. A good structure to answering the case is necessary. The interviewee should suggest a possible framework and a solution but he/she should have a clue about the major problems of implementing changes in a non-traditional business environment like Ghana.\nGathering information in Ghana is extremely difficult, and managers tend to flood consultants with information. Therefore a good structure, the ability to prioritize and navigate through useless or cloudy/ambiguous information is important. For these reasons, the interviewer can give upfront useless information and hide the important ones.\nSince Ghana best practices are still to be polished, it is important that the interviewee display a certain degree of flexibility and adaptability while asking questions. The use of inflated and difficult terms should also be avoided.\nPossible Answer:\nInterviewer: So how would you analyze this case?\nCandidate: It really looks like an interesting and complex case. May I have a second to structure my analysis?\nInterviewer: Sure.\nCandidate: OK, so these are the basic steps of my structure.\nFirst, I want to know more about the products. It looks like Busy Internet has a very diverse product/service mix. So I want to know more about the service Busy Internet is selling to its customers, they can have different profit margins.\nNext, since Profit = Revenues – Costs, I want to analyze these 2 elements separately.\nFinally, I want to analyze the market’s trend for each of these products/service.\nInterviewer: Sounds great, let’s start with the product mix. Busy Internet sells a big variety of different services to its clients, but we can group the major sources of revenues in 3 different products:\n\nCopy Center\nCyber Cafe\nISP, Internet Service Provider\n\nCandidate: OK, let’s analyze these 3 divisions separately.\nInterviewer: All right, what’s next?\nCandidate: What do we know about the costs for these 3 divisions? Have they increased lately?\nInterviewer: Ghana experiences black outs, and in order to maintain the service Busy Internet must use a very expensive power generator. Apart from that, the 3 product lines have not experienced any increase in cost.\nCandidate: What do we know about the revenues for these 3 divisions?\nInterviewer: The copy center is experiencing a decrease in revenues; the same can be said for the cyber cafe while the ISP is slowly growing.\nCandidate: That is interesting. Do we know any information about the global markets for all these products? Are these markets growing in Ghana? Are they fragmented?\nInterviewer: OK, here is some more information:\n\nCopy center: it’s a growing market, many new small players are entering the market making lots of money\nCyber Cafe: internet cafes are not doing very well in Ghana. Many internet cafes are closing as more Ghanaians are enjoying internet connection at home\nISP: it’s a growing market, technology is improving and it is now possible to reach many customers via radio and wireless\n\nCandidate: Thank you. What do we know about the competitors?\nInterviewer: Good question. There are new entrants in the Cyber Cafe market, a new internet cafe called Mega Internet is stealing customers from Busy Internet Cafe. Competitors in the ISP market are mostly minor players with the addition of Ghana Telecom, the government sponsored Internet Service Provider.\nCandidate: What is our value proposition to our customers? Similarly, how is the competition targeting our customers?\nInterviewer: Busy Internet customers are elite customers, prices at Busy Internet are very expensive (the highest in Accra), and cusomters expect high quality. Not many competitors can target the same segment of customers. We can say that there is only one big competitor that can offer similar quality compared to Busy Internet cafe.\nCandidate: The scenario now looks clearer. Our revenues for the cyber cafe are declining for a decrease in volume and not in price. Why is Busy Internet loosing clients in the cyber cafe?\nInterviewer: Good questions. How would you look for that?\nCandidate: My idea would be to ask the customers. Also, we can conduct quality survey, supervise customer behaviors, and assess employees’ performances.\nInterviewer: It looks like Busy’s customers are gradually moving to another cafe Mega Internet since customer care and service quality is better. Also PCs in the internet cafe at Busy are getting old and many of them are not working properly, decreasing actual capacity and customer loyalty.\nCandidate: I have another question, I am still not sure why our revenues in the copy center are decreasing while the market and demand for copy center is growing. Is that connected with the decrease in traffic of the internet cafe?\nInterviewer: It could be. What other possibilities would you investigate?\nCandidate: Well, there are many possible issues\n\nQuality: our printers or copy machines are not competitive\nCustomer service: our workforce is not trained\nEfficiency: probably our printers and copy machines are getting old and they break more frequently, decreasing volume and customer loyalty\nCapacity: Busy Internet has probably not set up the right sufficient capacity to meet the growing demand for copy center services\n\nInterviewer: Good points, they all make sense. Ms. Estelle Akofio-Sowah, the managing director of Busy Internet, has just reached us to ask for the executive summary of your analysis. What should we tell her?\nCandidate: It looks like the decrease in profit is due primarily to decrease in revenues and in volumes.\n\n\n\n\nRevenues\nCost\nMarket\nBusy Internet’s Market Position\n\n\nCopy Center\ndeclining\nstable\ngrowing\naverage player\n\n\nCyber Cafe\ndeclining\nstable\ndeclining\nmajor player\n\n\nISP\ngrowing\nstable\ngrowing\nmajor player\n\n\n\nBusy Internet must concentrate its investment in the copy center, since it is a growing market. The cyber cafe is a declining business in a shrinking market, but Busy Internet should keep the cyber cafe and use it to cross sell other products like ISP and copy center services. Busy should invest heavily in customer care, employee training, performance incentives, technology improvement in order to perk up services and increase cyber cafe customers’ loyalty.\nISP is growing. Busy Internet should leverage its customer base, client portfolio and its economy of scale to anticipate and satisfy customer expectations.\nOptional Bonus Questions on implementation\nInterviewer: Ms. Estelle Akofio-Sowah looks impressed of your analysis. But she also looks skeptical on some of the points you have just mentioned. She thinks that there are no major problems on the technology side as well as the customer care. Investments on these areas are expensive and additional funds from shareholders have to be motivated.\n\nHow would you try to convince her that these changes are vital?\nWhat approach do you think could convince her?\nWhat about the other managers involved in these change?\nWhat do you expect will be the major issues in implementing change at BusyInternet?\nHow can these changes be sustainable and long-lasting?\nWhy do you think Ghanaians resist changes and like their status quo?\n\nThese questions are like “bonus questions” and are meant to be asked only to these candidates that developed a very good understanding of the economic/problem solving side of the case and are ready to give suggestions also on the implementation/leadership side.\nRather than asking about previous leadership experiences in which the candidates demonstrated motivation, persuasion and other interpersonal skills, this case offers the opportunity to “bring the interviewee to Ghana” for 20 minutes and assess his/her economic and interpersonal skills on a real African situation. The last part of the case can be easily changed on a role-play interview so to give a more realistic taste to the case discussion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: operations strategy.\nConsulting Firm: Arthur D. Little first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: telecommunications, network.\nCase Interview Question #00620: Our client Revol Wireless is a regional wireless carrier and cell phone operator in the Midwest of the United States. Headquartered in Independence, Ohio, and operated by Cleveland Unlimited, Inc., the company offers completely unlimited wireless service, on a high quality all digital CDMA wireless network with flexible plans and unlimited service at an affordable rate. Customers pay a set amount of money each month for unlimited talk, text and data.\nThe CEO of Revol Wireless has hired Arthur D. Little to advise him on his strategy for the next five years. You are one of the consultants working on this project, and you will be responsible for the sales effectiveness strategy. Basically, the CEO wants to focus the company’s investments in the most effective and profitable channels. The company currently has three direct sales channels: own retail stores, in-bound (responsive) call center, and an outbound (proactive) call center. Based on the economics of each sales channel, what do you advise him to focus on?\nSuggested Approach:\nThe interviewer was expecting a basic knowledge of the telecommunications industry as well as the three sales channels, and the case requires the interviewee to focus on the calculations. Customer Lifetime Value is a major framework to be used to approach this marketing and strategy case. Also, the interviewee has to drive the questions and collect – in a structured manner – all the numbers needed to solve the case. It is important to ask the appropriate questions as well as state the reasoning behind each question. Some important elements are:\n\nDiscuss customer service versus sales\nUnderstand the mix of variable costs and fixed costs\n\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate if requested)\nEconomics of each of the three sales channels\n\n\n\n\nIn-bound Call Center\nOut-bound Call Center\nOwned Retail\n\n\nSuccess rate\n10%\n50%\n50%\n\n\nTraffic (# of customers)\n20 millions\n1 million\n1 million\n\n\nAverage revenue per customer\n$40\n$50\n$85\n\n\nFixed / Variable cost\n50/50\n25/75\n80/20\n\n\nTotal cost\n$1 million\n$1 million\n$10 millions\n\n\nCustomer service portion\n50%\n0%\n0%\n\n\n\nPossible Solution:\nInterviewer: So, how would you go about this case?\nCandidate: (Summarize the case and work on a framework) I want to understand the customers (size of the market, customer segmentation and consumer behavior), the competition and key figures of each sales channel (acquisition rate, sales volume, success rate, fixed cost, variable cost and traffic).\nInterviewer: Very good. Our client, the CEO of Revol Wireless, does not have insight about customer segmentation in each of the channels though.\nCandidate: Right. Let us see which figures the client has available. Do we know traffic in each channel?\nInterviewer: We do. In-bound call center and retail stores are accessed respectively by 20 millions and 1 million customers a year. The out-bound call-center accesses 1 million customers.\nCandidate: I would imagine some of these customers are also demanding customer services, right?\nInterviewer: You are right for the in-bound call center, which also serves as a customer service channel in a proportion of 50-50 (sales: 50%, customer service: 50%). However, our client believes that every customer visiting a retail store generates revenue, and the out-bound call center only focuses on sales.\nCandidate: What about success rate per each channel?\nInterviewer: In-bound call center, out-bound call-center and retail stores have respectively 10%, 50% and 50% success rates.\nCandidate: In looking at lifetime customer value, do we know the churn for each channel?\nInterviewer: Actually we don’t. But our client believes it is the same across all segments.\nCandidate: What about revenues per channel?\nInterviewer: Sales generated by in-bound call center, out-bound call-center and retail stores generate respectively $40, $50 and $85 in revenue on average per customer.\nCandidate: Perfect, we already have enough data for sales. What about cost? Do we know either total cost or cost per “call” for each channel?\nInterviewer: Our client has provided us with cost broken down by channel. In-bound call center, out-bound call center and retail stores generate respectively $1 million, $1 million and $10 millions in costs.\nCandidate: Do we know how much is fixed vs variable cost?\nInterviewer: We do know the current percentages. Out of total costs, fixed cost for inbound call center, out-bound call center and retail generate are respectively 50%, 25% and 80%.\nCandidate: Fair enough. This is what we’ve got so far:\n\n\n\n\nIn-bound Call Center\nOut-bound Call Center\nOwned Retail\n\n\nSuccess rate\n10%\n50%\n50%\n\n\nTraffic\n20 million\n1 million\n1 million\n\n\nAverage revenue per customer\n$40\n$50\n$85\n\n\nCustomer service portion\n50%\n0%\n0%\n\n\nSales portion\n50%\n100%\n100%\n\n\nTotal Revenues\n20 million * 10% * 50% * $40 = $40 million\n1 million * 50% * $50 = $25 million\n1 million * 50% * $85 = $42.5 million\n\n\nRevenues per new customer\n$40 million / (20 million * 50%) = $4\n$25 million / 1 million = $25\n$42.5 million / 1 million = $42.5\n\n\nFixed / Variable cost\n50/50\n25/75\n80/20\n\n\nTotal cost\n$1 million\n$1 million\n$10 millions\n\n\nFixed cost\n$1 million * 50% = $500K\n$1 million * 25% = $250K\n$10 million * 80% = $8 million\n\n\nVariable cost\n$1 million * 50% = $500K\n$1 milion * 75% = $750K\n$10 million * 20% = $2 million\n\n\nVariable cost per relevant traffic\n$500K / (20 million * 50%) = $0.05\n$750K / 1 million = $0.75\n$2 million / 1 million = $2.00\n\n\n\nFrom the calculations, we see that the average revenue per new customer generated by retail stores is the highest while inbound call center generates the lowest.\nAlso, on the cost side, although the fixed cost by out-bound call center is the lowest, the variable cost for the in-bound call center is the lowest. Additionally, the out-bound cost center’s revenue is the lowest. This means that the out-bound call center generates a lower contribution margin, as its fixed cost is proportionally the lowest portion. Thus, out-bound call center’s total cost could increase the most should our client decide to invest more in this channel versus other channels – retail stores with a 80% fixed cost and in-bound call center with 50%. Because of the high variable costs, out-bound cost centers are a higher risk.\nInterviewer: Very well. What is your recommendation then?\nCandidate: I would advise our client to focus its investments in the in-bound call center. The relevant variable cost for this channel is low, but so is the revenue for new customers. The client should examine the causes for the low revenue with an eye towards generating more revenue from customers through this channel.\nInterviewer: Excellent. Thanks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "url": "http://www.consultingcase101.com/hannaford-to-improve-supermarket-shopping-experience/",
        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: business competition; increase sales.\nConsulting Firm: McKinsey & Company first round summer internship job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: retail; general merchandisers.\nCase Interview Question #00622: Our client Hannaford is a regional supermarket and grocery chain based in Scarborough, Maine, United States. They have about 200 grocery stores as of 2012, and operate in New England region (northeastern corner of the United States consisting of the six states of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut) and upstate New York only. In number of stores operated, Hannaford is now the second largest supermarket chain headquartered in New England, behind only Quincy, Massachusetts-based Stop & Shop Supermarket.\nHannaford was doing very well for the last several years. However, from the most recent 2 years Hannaford’s market share growth is starting to slow down. Their margins have been falling. Their average sales per store has been  decreasing. To make things worse, Walmart recently has opened 4 super centers which contain 75% of the same collection of items sold by Hannaford. And Walmart plans to open even more stores in the region.\nHow do we reverse the decline in Hannaford’s average sales per store? How do we successfully compete with Walmart?\nNote to Interviewer:\nUnlike other profitability cases, the interviewer or case giver should not give the candidate time to come up with a framework. Instead pose the first question immediately.\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate if requested) \nHannaford’s supermarket stores are a full-range stores including groceries, pet food, clothing, pharmacy, etc. Some stores include banks, dry cleaners, and post offices. A few others include child care, flower shops and catering.\n\n15% have banks, dry cleaners and post offices\n5% have child care, flower shops, and catering\nThe remaining are regular grocery stores.\n\nPossible Solution:\nInterviewer: What are the reasons for the decline of average sales per store?\nCandidate: It could be several reasons:\n\nTargeting the wrong segment\nIncorrect Location (too many competitors nearby)\nInadequate marketing\nPricing\nInadequate customer service\nConvenience\nOwned store vs. franchise – take a look at franchise contracts to ensure that they are motivated to push sales.\nEconomy\nWe have just 5% of stores having all services. Maybe competitors have a 1 stop shop with flower, child care, dry clean, banks, etc.\nSome stores may be more profitable than the others, but some others are less profitable, thus bringing the average down.\n\nInterviewer: We have undertaken a survey among consumers which has showed that the consumers perceive our prices to be 20% greater than that of Wal-Mart. In addition, even though our prices are similar to our nearest competitor Stop & Shop, the customers perceive our prices to be greater than them as well.\nWhat actions can the marketing manager take to change the customer’s perception of prices?\nCandidate: Does each shop have the ability to change prices or is it centrally governed for all 200 stores?\nInterviewer: Each store has the ability to set their own prices.\nCandidate: Some actions could be\n\nDirect to consumer marketing\nOffer discounts\nBring down prices of some products which are significantly higher than our competitor\nIncrease customer services\nLaunch a customer loyalty program\nCheck prices of affiliated services like dry cleaning, child care, flower shops, and catering, etc. Maybe high prices there has created the pricy image for the grocery store\nFranchise vs. owned stores, check for store managers’ incentives to incease price\n\nInterviewer: The Hannaford store chain decides that they need to bring down the prices of the fastest selling 6,000 items by 15%. How much would it cost the company given the following additional information?\n\n\n\nAverage sales per store\n$20 million\n\n\nFastest 6000 items\n24%\n\n\nNext 15000 items\n42%\n\n\nNumber of stores\n200\n\n\nSuper stores\n120\n\n\nStores over 15000 square feet\n108\n\n\n\nCandidate: (do the calculations)\n\n\n\nAverage sales per store\n$20 million\n\n\nFastest 6000 items\n24%\n\n\nSales of fastest 6000\n$20 million * 24% = $4.8 million\n\n\nImpact on profit\n15% * $4.8 million = $0.72 million\n\n\nTotal impact\n200 stores * $0.72 million = $144 million\n\n\n\nInterviewer: Good. We have the results of our recent market research: the percentage of customers who are satisfied with shopping experience, convenience of store locations, healthy foods, organic meat, good deals, store prices (see Figure 1). The client the CEO of Hannaford is eager to have us analyze the data. Could you let us know the implications of this data for our strategy?\n\nCandidate: This market research shows that we are doing well in convenience aspect and healthy foods and organic meat, but we don’t have a good shopping experience and our store prices are perceived to be high.\nInterviewer: Great. Let’s assume that the CEO just walked in and would like you to give him the next steps. What would you tell him?\nCandidate: You came to us with a question of what we should do to successfully compete with Walmart and reverse the decline in our revenues. We looked at the various factors that may affect the average sales/store. We also conducted market research to show where we could improve. Based on the market research, I would recommend the following:\n\nImprove the shopping experience\nFocus on marketing our competitive advantage – convenience of locations, healthy foods and organic meat\nWork on improving consumers perception of our prices.\n\nInterviewer: Thank you. You did a great job.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: merger & acquisition (M&A).\nConsulting Firm: IBM Global Business Services (GBS) second round summer internship job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: leisure & recreation.\nCase Interview Question #00623: The client is the manager of Bronx Zoo. The Bronx Zoo is a large zoo located in the Bronx borough of New York City, within Bronx Park. It is one of the world’s largest metropolitan zoos, with some 4,000 animals representing about 650 species from around the world. The zoo comprises 265 acres of park lands and naturalistic habitats, through which the Bronx River flows. The Bronx Zoo is part of an integrated system of four zoos and one aquarium managed by the New York Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS).\nRecently, there has been a discovery of a dinosaur in West Africa. It is believed to be the only dinosaur in the world. The management of Bronx Zoo would like to investigate if purchasing the dinosaur is a good project for their zoo.\nYou have been hired to help the client with the following questions:\n\nHow would you determine if purchasing the dinosaur is a good project for the Bronx Zoo?\nIf so, how would you determine the purchase price for the dinosaur?\nHow would you design the exhibit area for the dinosaur?\n\n What would be the size of the exhibit area?\n How would you route traffic around the exhibit area?\n How would draw the shape of the exhibit area in relation to the dinosaur and show how the traffic is routed around the exhibit area.\n\n\n\nNote to Interviewer:\nQuestions 1 and 2 should be presented first. Once the candidate has a good handle on the answers for those two questions should the interviewer present Question 3. Question 3 is asking the candidate to think outside the box.\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate if requested)\n\nThe dinosaur is of the size of an elephant.\nThe dinosaur can easily be transported from West Africa to the US.\nThe age of the dinosaur is unknown.\nThe dinosaur cannot reproduce as it is the only dinosaur in the world.\nThe dinosaur is not violent but cannot interact with non-trained individuals.\nThe Bronx Zoo has enough land to house the dinosaur and construct an exhibit area without reconfiguring the existing park.\n\nPossible Solution:\nThe candidate will probably ask what are the costs and revenues associated with this project. Do not just give them the revenues and costs immediately. Ask them what they think the revenues and costs are associated with the dinosaur purchase project and ask them to explain each one.\nFor Example: Ticket Sales.\nHow do you determine the revenue from tickets? Are you proposing a separate ticket for the dinosaur exhibit? If so, then you can count those revenues. If you are proposing the same ticket for the zoo and dinosaur exhibit, then not all the revenues from tickets will count. Only the revenues from the tickets in excess of original ticket sales will count.\nRelevant Data for Questions 1 and 2 (wait to see if the student asks for this relevant information before giving it to them):\nRevenue per year\n\nTickets = $2 million\nHotels Accommodations = $1 million\nMovie & Entertainment Licensing = $0.5 million\nFood in the park = $0.5 million\nMerchandise = $0.25 million\nResearch = $0.25 million\n\nCost\n\nFixed Costs\n\n Cost of the dinosaur = ?\n Exhibit Area and Housing Area = $15 million\n\n\nVariable Costs (per year)\n\n Staff to serve the dinosaur = $1 million\n Food & Merchandise sales = $0.25 million\n Operations = $0.25 million\n\n\n\nExpected Lifespan of Dinosaur = 50 years\nCurrent Age of Dinosaur = 20 years\nDiscount rate = 10%\nThe candidate will probably ask the interviewer for actual numbers associated with the revenues and costs. While the actual numbers are not that important, it is important that the candidate realize that just having the sum of the revenues greater than the sum of the cost is not enough.\nThe candidate needs to realize that this is a net present value (NPV) problem and the project lasts as long as the dinosaur is alive. It is important to determine the age of the dinosaur. Since the client Bronx Zoo does not know the age and the average lifespan of the dinosaur, the candidate should suggest ways of determining the age and lifespan of the dinosaur. Some suggestions could be asking anthropologist, DNA testing, fossil testing, and etc.\nBesides knowing the expected lifespan of the dinosaur and all the revenues and costs, the candidate needs to ask about the discount rate. Now with all the information, the candidate can determine the maximum ammount of money (brean-even price) the client could pay for the dinosaur. Again, the calculations are not important but knowing the right equation is.\nNPV = Fixed Cost – [ (Revenues – Variable cost) / discount rate ]\n(assume annual revenues and variable costs are static over time to simplify the equation)\nTo solve for maximum price of the dinosaur, assume the minimum NPV = 0.\nQuestion 3: How would you design the exhibit area for the dinosaur?\nPossible Answer:\na. What would be the size of the exhibit area?\nThe candidate should ask about the size of the dinosaur before recommending the size of the exhibit area. An example answer will be – Since the dinosaur is of the size of an elephant, a football field will be a good size area. If the dinosaur is at the other end of the field, the spectators will still be able to see the dinosaur.\nSuppose the exhibit area is round with a diameter of 100 yards, what is the circumference of the exhibit area? Circumference = PI * Diameter\nThe candidate should realize that there will be a heavy demand to view the dinosaur. Spectators will be coming from all over the world to see the world’s only dinosaur. It is important to cycle the spectators through the exhibit area so they have an enjoyable visit and the client is able to get as many spectators through as possible in a day.\nb. How will you route the spectators around the exhibit area?\nIf the candidate proposes having the spectators walk around the exhibit area in either a clockwise or counter clockwise direction, have them explain how they will prevent traffic from collecting around the location the dinosaur is at.\n\nIdeal Situation – Every spectator has the same view.\n\nNot the ideal situation – The spectators at A and B don’t have the same view. Traffic will likely build up at B. Ask the candidate, how can you prevent this from happening?\nAgain, there is no right or wrong answer. An example will be – Make the exhibit area like an amusement ride. Therefore the client can prevent traffic from building up and the client can control the cycle time the spectators spend in the exhibit area. Another good answer is to have an exhibit area that has multiple levels so the client can cycle more spectators through.\nNote:\n\nThe right candidate to this case should quickly focus on the Net Present Value (NPV) equation and what the revenue and cost of this project are.\nNPV = Current Upfront Cost – Present Value of (Annual Revenues – Annual Cost)\nRevenue should be broken down into all the possible avenues that will generate sales. Cost should be broken down in all the possible costs that are associated with the project.\nThe candidate should realize that the dinosaur does not live forever therefore the revenue stream would disappear as soon as the dinosaur dies.\nAlso, an outstanding candidate will discuss potential risks associated with the project, for example:\n\n The dinosaur could die of diseases in North America.\n No zoo in the world has ever cared for a dinosaur before. The creates a host of unknown problems that could drive up costs.\n The dinosaur may be more able to attack or hurt spectators then normal animals, thus raise liability risk.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

It is one of the world’s largest independent biotechnology firms. Amgen currently has one drug on the market sold mainly in the United States. This product was the most successful biopharmaceutical product at the time of their release. This drug has also been sold to a lesser degree in the United Kingdom and Germany.\nRecently, the management of Amgen is looking to increase its presence in Europe and is considering expanding into Poland, Spain, and France, specifically.

Second, I would like to know why its presence in UK and Germany is low and why the company is considering Poland, Spain and France and no other country.\nTo assess which country they should expand into I would like to investigate:\n\nThe market for the product our client company is selling in each of the countries (market size, profitability, growth).\nCompetition and understand how fragmented the market is, what is the market share for our customer and for competition, what is the likely reaction of competition to our launch\nPotential government regulation regarding the introduction of a new drug\n\nThe final decision will be based on the answer to the question regarding which of the countries is going to bring more profits to the client.\nNote: when the candiate asks for the number of angioplasties in the three countries, before showing them the slide, ask him/her to brainstorm first.\nQuestion #2: How can we determine the number of angioplasties per country?\nPossible Answers:\n\nGovernment registries\nWorld Health Organization\nCall hospitals\nUse comparable countries to estimate proportion of surgeries to population of country\n\nNote: when the candidate asks for the market shares, after showing them the slide, ask him/her to brainstorm.\nQuestion #3: What can be causing the varying market share for Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer?\nPossible Answers:\n\nFirst mover’s advantage\nVarying advertising spending\nLocal connections\nVarying perception of doctors of which surgery has high and low risk\n\nAdditional Information: (to be given upon request)\n1. Comparison of Amgen and each of its competitors\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ):\n\n Drug used in high risk surgeries (~40% of surgeries)\n Price $400 / drug\n\n\nPfizer, Inc. (NYSE: PFE):\n\n Drug used in low risk surgeries (~40% of surgeries)\n Price $400 / drug\n\n\nMerck & Co. (NYSE: MRK):\n\n Drug used in very high risk surgeries (~10% of surgeries)\n Price $2,000 / drug\n\n\nAmgen (NASDAQ: AMGN):\n\n Drug used for high and low risk surgeries\n Claims less blood clotting\n Price $400 / drug\n\n\n\n2. Time to market differs by country:\n\n Poland: 0-2 years\n Spain: 0 years\n France: 6 months\n\n3. Distribution available, but costs are controlled by country:\n\n Poland: 5% of revenue\n Spain: 0% of revenue\n France: 10% of revenue\n\n4. Government restrictions:\n\n None in any of the three countries\n\nQuestion #4: Which country should the client Amgen expand into?\nPossible Solution:\nThe candidate should set up a table like the one below to help make a decision.\n\n\n\nCountry\nFrance\nSpain\nPoland\n\n\nMarket size\n70K\n40K\n20K\n\n\nMarket growth\n-5% per year\n0%\n+10% per year\n\n\nCompetitive environment\n2 main competitors having equal shares\nOne dominant competitor\nOne dominant competitor\n\n\nDistribution cost\n10% of revenue\nNo cost\n5% of revenue\n\n\nTime to market\n6 months\nImmediately\n0-2 years\n\n\n\nA good candidate will come up with a Final Recommendation (Either France or Spain is a good answer as long as the candidate supports it)\nI recommend the client enters France. With 70K angioplasties per year, even with the decrease of -5% every year, it will still be the best option for the next 5 years. No other competitor has leverage in the French market.\nEntering the French market will take 6 months, so they can begin selling it very fast. In the mean time they should start to develop relationships with physicians and secure distribution channels.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: business competition, competitive response.\nConsulting Firm: Huron Consulting Group second round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: materials.\nCase Interview Question #00650: Our client D&K Group is a leading manufacturer of thin laminating films based in Elk Grove Village, Illinois, United States. For over 30 years, the company has produced top quality laminating solutions for many industries. Their products include various kinds of thermal, pressure sensitive, heat activated, and specialty laminating films.\nThe majority of D&K Group’s lamination films are used to make advertisements and signs (think ads on the side of the city buses, buildings or billboards). They are sold in all manners of colors and finishes (matte, gloss, shiny, etc). The client currently sells its material in the USA at 10 cents per square feet.\nRecently, a European competitor has just finished building a lamination factory in Los Angeles. The European competitor is starting to approach our client D&K’s customers and offering to sell them lamination film product at 9 cents per square feet. The President and CEO of D&K Group has hired us to help them figure out if they should match the competitor’s price. What would you tell him? Should the client match the competitor’s price or not?\nPossible Solution:\nInterviewer: So, how would you go about this case?\nCandidate: (Establishing the case and asking for more information) So, our client is facing competition in the US from a European manufacturer. Our task is to evaluate this threat and advise our client on a strategy to match or not match the  competitor’s price.\nInterviewer: That’s right.\nCandidate: Before delving into the case, I need some more information on what are the products our client sells and who are the customers of our client.\nInterviewer: OK, our client D&K Group’s products are all kinds of thin laminating films. This plastic film is manufactured in giant rolls and cannot be economically transported by air and cannot survive the harsh conditions of shipment by sea.\nCurrently the majority of sales are to independent regional suppliers. The reminder of sales is shipped directly to major accounts like major advertising companies, Home Depot, etc.\nCandidate: (Establishing a framework/structure. A good structure should include the following)\nBasically, there are two options for our client: (1) matching the competitor’s price, or (2) not matching.\nTo assess the feasibility of each of the two options, I want to investigate the following areas:\n\nthe profits in both cases and the long term implications of either approach\n\n In order to do that, we need to look at the revenues and costs. We need to analyze the type of products our customer sells and at what price. Then we need to assess the variable costs along with the fixed costs.\n\n\nthe market\n\n market size\n the market share of our client and how much of it would be threatened by the European competitor\n\n\n\nInterviewer: Sounds like a plan. Here is the information I have.\nAdditional Information given only when requested\nMarket size (USA) = 1 billion sq. ft.\nCurrent market share of client = 100% – The candidate should immediately realize that it is a Monopoly!\nThis lamination film is essentially a commodity – The candidate should immediately know that it means that the customers are sensitive to price and would switch to a cheaper version.\nThe new competing plant of the European competitor has only capacity to produce 250 million sq. ft. per year – The candidate should calculate that it represents only 25% of the US market.\n75% of D&K Group’s products can be manufactured by the competitor with no discernable difference – The candidate should realize that 25% of the products are differentiated products because it uses high tech coating process that prevents colors from fading.\nAdditional Insights:\nBecause it is a Monopoly, our client should attempt to price as high as possible to consume all customer’s willingness to pay.\nOur client should concentrate on the 25% of the product that cannot be copied by the competitor:\n\n Increase the price of these specialty items\n Without substitutes, higher margins here can offset the lost revenue on the other 75% of the products\n\nCandidate: Do we have any information about the profit margins, so we can estimate the profits?\nInterviewer: (Show the following exhibit)\nProfit Margin for existing plastic film manufacturing operations (per 1,000 square feet)\n\n Revenue: $100\n COGS (sost of goods sold): $65\n Profit: $35\n\nCandidate: (Do the following calculations)\nIf the client does not match price:\n\n Market share lost: 25%\n Profit loss = $0.035/sq. ft. * 250M sq. ft. = $8.75M\n We made the assumption of 100% conversion to the competition\n\nLong term implications: This situation leaves D&K Group open to further market erosion if competitor increases its capacity. Margins can also be eroded due to loss of scale (not a good long term solution)\nIf the client matches competitor’s price:\n\n Profit loss: 1c / sq. ft. on every sale -> 1,000M sq. ft * $0.01/sq. ft. = $10M\n We made the assumption that no market share will be lost (which is not necessarily true)\n\nLong term implications: it is more expensive in the short run but defends the client’s market position.\nInterviewer: Good. Based on your calculations, how much market share would need to be lost before it would cost more (in the short term) to match the 9c / sq ft. price?\nCandidate: Let the lost market share be x.\n(1,000M * x) * $0.035 = $10M, x = 28.57%\nInterviewer: Great. So, what is your recommendation to the client?\nCandidate: The client D&K Group must match competitor’s price to stave off possible market share decline of 25% in the first year and potentially more if competition expands its existing plant. The remaining 25% of products should retain their high prices and perhaps even raise the prices to maximize producer surplus. There are some risks though as even with the price match, they can lose some market share.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: operations strategy.\nConsulting Firm: NERA Economic Consulting first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: entertainment; mass media.\nCase Interview Question #00651: The client Warner Bros. Studios is an American producer of film, television, and music entertainment. The company is a subsidiary of media and entertainment conglomerate Time Warner (NYSE: TWX), with its headquarters in Burbank, California and New York City. As one of the major film studios, Warner Bros. develops and distributes full-length feature films for the U.S. and international markets.\nWarner Bros. Studios is planning on releasing its big budget film of the year six months from now and is considering a new release strategy. The first component of the strategy is to release the movie in theaters on the same day around the world. The second component of the strategy is to release the DVD of the movie day-and-date, meaning globally releasing the DVD the same day as the theater release.\nWarner Bros. is interested in knowing whether this is the best release strategy for this movie and, if not, Warner Bros. would then like to know what its release strategy should be. How would you go about analyzing this case and helping the client make a decision?\nAdditional Information provided upon request:\n\nWarner Bros. has done simultaneous global theater releases for other movies before, but never simultaneous with the DVD release.\nOnly one movie has ever been simultaneously released theatrically and through DVD, and it was by a small, independent film company.\nThe new film, “The Dark Knight Rises”, is the third movie of a superhero action series known as the “Batman Trilogy”. The previous two films were produced by another studio, so we have no financial data on them.\nThe simultaneous theatrical and DVD release is expected to cause a 20% decrease in revenue from theater ticket sales and a 25% increase in DVD sales.\nThe marketing campaign for the movie is expected to be $50 million, while the marketing campaign for the DVD is expected to be $5 million. With the simultaneous release, no DVD marketing campaign is required.\nPirating movies accounts for a 20% loss in total theater revenue. A simultaneous global theater release will cut this down by 25%.\n\nAdditional Exhibits\n1. Revenue from theatrical releases of big budget films (last year)\n\n\n\nCategory\nNumber of films\nGross revenue\n\n\nBlockbuster\n4\n$500M\n\n\nSuccess\n10\n$250M\n\n\nBreakeven\n15\n$100M\n\n\nFailure\n8\n$50M\n\n\n\n2.

Revenue breakdown of big budget films\nPossible Solution:\nThe main question to answer is if the new strategy Warner Bros. is considering is better than the usual movie release strategy commonly used in the movie industry. To assess this we need to see which of the two release strategies brings more profits to the client Warner Bros.\n\nRegular Strategy: We need to estimate the revenues that could be generated and costs involved with this type of release (which is from my knowledge: theater release in the US followed by theater release internationally, then DVD release internationally). In order to estimate the expected revenues, I would look at similar type of movies and their economics.\nNew strategy: I would start by checking if this new strategy has ever been used and the results it brought.\n\nThen I would estimate the changes in revenues, costs of this new strategy versus the regular one.\nFinally, I believe we need to check if there are any regulation regarding international theater release and how these regulations will affect our new strategy.\nEssentially, it comes down to deciding between two options on two dimensions:\n\nReleasing the movie in the same day globally or first in the US and then around the world\nReleasing the DVD together with the movie or separately\n\nThe candidate should then calculate the expected revenue from the theater release and from the DVD release using second and third Exhibits and other information that he/she gathered.\n\nEstimated theater revenue = ($500M∗14 + $250M∗3 + $100M∗2 + $50M∗1) / (14 + 3 + 2 + 1) = $400 million\nEstimated DVD revenue = $400M * 30% / 60% = $200 million\n\nTo decide between going simultaneously with the theater and DVD release versus going separately, the candidate need to calculate the profits generated by the two strategies.\n\n\n\nRelease strategy\nSimultaneous\nSeparate\n\n\nTheater revenue\n$400M * 80% = $320M\n$400M\n\n\nDVD revenue\n$200M*125% = $250M\n$200M\n\n\nMarketing cost\n$50M\n$55M\n\n\nProfit (before other common costs)\n$320 + $250 – $50 = $520M\n$400 + $200 – $55 = $545M\n\n\n\nTo decide if the client should go separately for the theater release or simultaneously, the candidate needs to calculate the impact on piracy too.\n\n$400M = revenue earned (80% of total possible revenue)\nUnearned revenues (losses due to piracy) in the regular release strategy (theater release in the US followed by theater release internationally): $400M / 80% – $400M = $100M\nUnearned revenues (losses due to piracy) in the new release strategy (simultaneous global theater release): $100M * (1 – 25%) = $75M\n\nA good candidate will now make a Final Recommendation\nI recommend that the client Warner Bros. should do a simultaneous global theater release but a delayed DVD release because:\n\nDelayed DVD release would generate $25M additional revenue\nSimultaneous global theater release will save $25M by decreasing piracy\n\nHowever, there are some risks involved with this strategy. With global release we cannot reduce spending in case the movie fails in the US. There are also risks regarding the problems that may be caused by governments impeding or delaying the release in their respective countries. We need to investigate further these aspects before going forward with the plan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: private equity (PE),  investment.\nConsulting Firm: Capgemini Consulting first round job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: small business; restaurant & food service.\nCase Interview Question #00652: One of your friends has approached you about a new business opportunity he has found. He works for GTCR LLC, a private equity firm based in Chicago, Illinois. GTCR is mostly focused on leveraged buyout, leveraged recapitalization, growth capital and rollup transactions. The firm principally invests in high-growth industries, including business services and outsourcing, consumer products and services, health care, technology, and transaction processing.\nAs a successful investment professional and also a wealthy investor, your friend likes to buy up quick cash-producing small businesses around the country like restaurants, carwashes, laundromats, convenience stores, grocery shops, etc. Recently, he was approached by a restaurant owner with an offer. The restaurant owner runs a restaurant in Los Angeles with his wife. They are reaching retirement age and would like to pass on the business to someone else. The restaurant has always been a family-owned business and is part of a strip mall near the freeway. This strip mall also have four other restaurants and it sits across the street from two tall business centers.\nIn the past four years, the L.A. restaurant has been losing money and the owners don’t know why. What is going on with their profits? What do you recommend to turn around profits (if possible)? And do you recommend your friend acquire the business or not?\nAdditional Information: (to be provided if asked)\n1. Market\n\n The L.A. restaurant’s business depends almost entirely on adjacent business centers.\n Total revenue is a function mainly of lunch customers each day.\n Each of the two business centers has 20 floors and sits 100 people per floor on average (all of whom eat lunch).\n On any given day, 5% of the people working in the two business centers don’t show up for work or work at home, 50% of the remaining go out to lunch, and 90% of them go to the adjacent restaurants for food.\n The L.A. restaurant currently has 10% market share (relative to its 4 competitors).\n The 4 other competing restaurants are all fast-food.\n There has been no growth in the market for the last few years.\n\n2. Restaurant\n\n When business declined 4 years ago, the owners of the L.A. restaurant had to fire 2 assistants, which put a strain on manager / employee relations.\n The restaurant sells all kinds of food – mostly a broad “American” food place.\n The restaurant is sort of like a sit-down diner, but it also offers packaged food to go.\n Average waiting time at our restaurant is 5 minutes, while average waiting time at other ones is only 3 minutes.\n\nPossible Solution:\n1. Market Size Estimation\nAsk the candidate to estimate the number of customers served per day\nPossible Answer:\n\n2 buildings * 20 floors * 100 person capacity per floor = 4,000 people\n4,000 * 95% present = 3,800 in buildings\n3,800 present * 50% out to lunch * 90% who go to adjacent restaurants = 1,710 total market opportunity\n1,710 market opportunity * 10% market share = 171 customers each day\n\n2. Customer\nAsk the candidate: how would you find out why customers aren’t coming to the L.A. restaurant?\nPossible Answer:\n\nStand outside the two business centers and survey the people who work there\nAsk the customers who do come to the restaurant\nAsk the management of the two business centers\n\nIt turns out people who work in the two business centers go out only to look for a quick lunch, and our wait time is too long. Most customers take food back to business center and eat at desk – they don’t sit and eat at restaurant.\n3. Profits\nAsk the candidate: what if the breakeven for the L.A. restaurant every day is 200 customers? Do you recommend buying it or not?\nPossible Answer:\nAt first thought, 200 customers per day seems high for a restaurant just to break even\nCurrently the L.A. restaurant has only 171 customers each day, below 200: so, not a good idea to buy the restaurant.\nThen ask the candidate: what if we can improve restaurant operations so that the breakeven becomes 100 customers per day, how does that affect your recommendation? — That information makes it much more appealing, and so profitability objective is achieved\n4. Recommendations\nTo improve restaurant operations and profits, we could take the following actions:\n\nBrand more as quicker food option\nAdvertise in business centers\nOffer food delivery\nOffer more fast-food items on menu\nIdentify restaurant bottleneck and provide more resources\n\nTo acquire or not? There is no correct or wrong answer to this question. Your friend will have to consider many things before he can make a decision.\n\nPros:\n\n if your friend is optimistic that he can improve restaurant operations to reduce customer turnaround time\n your friend may be able to bring down breakeven level of customers, and so profitability.\n\n\nCons:\n\n the market is not growing\n the restaurant is facing strong competition from four other restaurants\n the challenges in picking up family-owned business\n\n\n\n5. Comments\nThe L.A. restaurant has been losing profits due to a decline in food interest from the adjacent business centers. Four years ago, the business centers lost several major tenants. Then two years later, the business centers were filled by new tenants, but restaurant sales have still been down. Once the business became less well-known, it never regained its brand image.\nThere is no correct or wrong answer to this case. The interviewee should be comfortable with ambiguity and little information. Also, the interviewee should be able to defend his/her assumptions and be flexible when the interviewer changes assumptions. The interviewer or case giver should challenge the interviewee in many areas.\nThere are good arguments to acquire and not to acquire. The candidate should pick a side and stick with it, unless there is enough information to suggest otherwise.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: math problem; operations strategy.\nConsulting Firm: Schlumberger Business Consulting (SBC) first round summer internship job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: mining, metals production.\nCase Interview Question #00641: The client Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM, TSX: NMC) is a gold mining company based in Greenwood Village, Colorado, USA. The Company’s operating segments include North America, South America, Asia Pacific and Africa. As one of the world’s largest producers of gold, Newmont has active mines in Nevada, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, Ghana and Peru. As of December, 2010, Newmont produced approximately 5.4 million equity ounces of gold annually. Other metals that the company mines include copper and silver.\nRecently, Newmont is going to exploit a mine in Peru that is expected to be full of a very unique gold ore. The CEO of Newmont has asked us in which order his mining team should extract the gold ore from the field. The gold ore will then be sent to a nearby factory that his company already owns. How would you go about analyzing the case and coming up with a solution?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate if requested)\n\nThe field is divided in cells of equal size. Once you blow one cell there is no way the truck can pass through it to go to the factory.\nEach cell has different gold ore content and therefore each cell has a different cost of extraction.\nTrucks enter the factory with rocks containing 1% of gold ore. The output is 100% gold ore.\nFor sake of simplicity, assume there will be no growth in population.\n\nBelow is a plan of the gold mining plant in Peru:\n\nRecommended Approach:\nThe interviewer is testing whether the candidate can identify a useful algorithm to determine the best way to extract gold ore from this field. The candidate should not initially waste any time developing one idea too fully; instead he/she should come up with a few reasonable suggestions and test them for validity with the interviewer. The candidate should, like in most cases, be aware that he/she is missing critical information and should identify what he/she needs to solve the case and then ask the interviewer for this data.\nPossible Solution:\nInterviewer: So, tell me how we might approach this problem for our client?\nCandidate: First, I would like to make sure that I fully understand our client’s needs. Let me repeat the key issues: our client wants us to provide him with a recommendation on what approach his mining team should take to extract the gold ore in order to maximize profits.\nInterviewer: Yes, that pretty much sums it up. So, what’s next?\nCandidate: I can imagine a number of different ways of prioritizing which cells to take out first, such as:\n1. Profit: Profits = Revenues – Costs = Price * Volume – Costs.\n2. Demand: Outlook of the price of the different types of gold ore. If the price is low (perhaps because demand today is lower), but we believe that this same ore will be sold for much more in the future (perhaps due to an increase in demand), it could make sense to begin extracting lower concentration cells.\nI am imagining that this could be similar to the oil industry. Think for example about the price of oil. The oil is in the field anyway, so it’s better to exploit the places with the least of oil when the oil price in the market is at a low level. Unless, of course, we can store the gold ore for long periods of time without a large opportunity cost by tying up capital and space.\n3. Capacity of the plant: Maybe there is a minimum level we need to provide to the plant as input. Maybe there is a maximum. This could determine how much we want to extract in any given time period, especially, if there are penalties for operating outside of this min-max range.\n4. Operational issues: For example, if I dig a hole in the ground and the truck cannot pass through that cell, it may be wise to start at the cells that are further from the factory so that I do not block off routes.\nInterviewer: OK, let’s assume that the points that you have raised are all reasonable. This is a complex business and I was pleased to hear you touch on many of the important points. But, first, let’s focus on profits. How would you define profit?\nCandidate: OK, in this case profits would be (price of a ton of gold ore) * (expected content of ore in cell) – (the cost of extraction for that cell). I will then rank each of the cells based on its overall profit contribution and determine my extraction path from there. Of course, we need to consider that if we extract from one highly profitable cell, but it cuts off access to a lesser, but still profitable, cell, this is a cost of doing business under this assumption and should reduce my overall expected profits.\nInterviewer: Let’s assume that we map the field and this is what we get:\n\nx = tons of gold ore in that cell\nC = cost of extracting in that cell in thousand dollar\nCandidate: Do we have any information on today’s price of the gold ore?\nInterviewer: Yes, our client expects to get $10,000 dollars per ton of gold ore.\nCandidate:\n\n For Cell 1 the profit will be: 1 * $10,000 – $3,000 = $7,000.\n For Cell 2 would be: 1.3 * $10,000 – $10,000 = $3,000.\n For Cell 3 would be: 1.1 * $10,000 – $5,000 = $6,000.\n\nSo I will start for Cell 1, then Cell 3 and finally exploit Cell 2.\nInterviewer: OK. What if price changes? Does it change your decision?\nCandidate: Yes.\nInterviewer: Why?\nCandidate: Let’s say price is now $30,000 per ton.\n\nFor Cell 1 the profit will be: 1 * $30,000 – $3,000 = $27,000.\nFor Cell 2: 1.3 * $30,000 – $10,000 = $29,000.\nFor Cell 3: 1.1 * $30,000 – $5,000 = $28,000.\n\nSo I would recommend extracting Cell 2, then Cell 3 and finally Cell 1. This is based on the fact that the costs appear to be fixed and do not change despite the overall price fluctuations that we are discussing.\nInterviewer: Let’s move on. Our client has told us that per ton Profit and Loss (P&L) statement is as follows…wait, perhaps you could tell me how you would construct it?\nCandidate: I would try to find out the average price, the average cost of goods sold (COGS) and then assign some part of the SG&A (Selling, General and Administrative Expenses) costs.\nInterviewer: OK. Here are the figures that our client provided. What is the company’s break-even point?\n\n\n\nItem\n$1,000 per ton\n\n\nRevenues\n1.0\n\n\nCOGS\n0.8\n\n\nSG&A\n0.6\n\n\nProfit\n-0.4\n\n\n\nCandidate: OK. The company has $200 gross margin per ton of gold ore, before we factor in SG&A costs. So, if I divide SG&A by the gross margin I will find how much they have to produce. In this case, $0.6 / $0.2 = 3, which means they have to produce 3 times more to cover fixed costs.\nInterviewer: How the same P&L would look like?\nCandidate: Basically, we have to divide the SG&A by 3. We are in essence spreading the fixed SG&A costs across more units. However, we would need to make sure that SG&A does not increase with volume of gold ore extracted.\n\n\n\nItem\n$1,000 per ton\n\n\nRevenues\n1.0\n\n\nCOGS\n0.8\n\n\nSG&A\n0.2\n\n\nProfit\n0.0\n\n\n\nInterviewer: Good, can you summarize what we have identified so far?\nCandidate: Sure. Our client was looking for a framework to identify the order in which he should extract cells of ore from a field. We chose to focus on profitability as the main driver. As mentioned, but not discussed in depth, profitability includes the core components of price per ton of ore, cost to extract the cell (which appears to be fixed), but also the cost of not being able to access a cell for extraction.\nOnce we have calculated the profits per cell our client can draw out a map to understand which cells to extract and when in order to maximize his P&L. Next we discussed the company’s P&L and identified that SF&A costs are relatively significant and appear to be fixed. This means that we would want to extract more ore in order to spread these costs across production and increase overall profitability.\nInterviewer: Great. Thank you.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: pricing & valuation.\nConsulting Firm: Gallup Consulting first round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: food & beverages; restaurant & food service.\nCase Interview Question #00653: The Town of Vail is a small town in Eagle County, Colorado, United States. The population of the town was approximately 5,300 in 2010. The town was established and built as the base village to Vail Ski Resort (a popular mountain ski resort in Eagle County, Colorado), with which it was originally conceived.\nA friend of mine owns a coffee shop in the Town of Vail. Recently, he asked me if I wanted to buy his coffee shop for $100,000. Do you think I should do it? Why or why not?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate upon request)\nThe interviewer or case giver should read this information well before he/she gives the case. Share this information in each bullet only if the candidate specifically asks for it in a clear and deliberate way.\nCustomers:\n\n The Vail, Colorado coffee shop serves mostly locals, not tourists, so the demand is consistent throughout the year.\nThe coffee shop is open 12 hours a day (7am to 7pm), six days a week (from Monday to Saturday), 50 weeks a year.\n\nProducts/Prices:\n\n Cup of coffee $4.00\n Bottled Water $2.00\n Pastries $3.00\n\nVariable Cost:\n\n All products sold in the coffee shop have a 50% margin\n\nOther Costs:\n\n Rent was $500 per month\n Wages (for 2 employees) were $8.00 per hour.\n\nThe interviewer should inform the candidate that he/she can assume that the coffee shop will bring in consistent profits.\nPossible Answer:\nThis is a pricing & valuation case question. So, to get the value of the coffee shop we need first to get its profitability.\nProfits = Revenues – Costs\n1. Revenues: Estimate the market size\nAssume that the coffee shop gets 10 customers per hour in slow hours and 20 customers per hour in a busy hour.\n\n on any regular week day, the first and the last 2 hours of the day are busy hours. So the coffee shop gets 20 * 4 + 10 * 8 = 160 customers per day.\n on Saturday all the hours are busy hours, then we have 20 * 12 = 240 customers on Saturday.\n Number of customers / week = 160 * 5 + 240 * 1 = 1040\n Number of customers / year = 1040 * 50 = 50,200 ~= 50,000\n\nAssume 60% of customers order coffee, 30% order pastry, and 10% buy a bottle of water, then the annual revenue is:\n\n 50,000 * 60% * $4 + 50,000 * 30% * $3 + 50,000 * 10% * $2 = $175,000\n\n2. Fixed Costs\n\nRent = $500/month * 12 months = $6,000 a year\nWages = $8/hour * 12 hours * 6 days * 50 weeks = $28,800 ~= $30,000\nTotal fixed costs: $30,000 + $6,000 = $36,000\n\nWe can also make assumptions about utilities and insurance.\n3. Profits\nProfits = Revenues – Costs = $175,000 * 50% profit margin – $36,000 = $52,500\nAssume a 30% tax rate:\n\n Profits after tax = $52,500 * (1 – 30%) = $36,750 ~= $36,000\n\n4. Valuation\nIf we assume that the coffee shop will be in operation for 5 more years and we use a 10% WACC (weighted average cost of capital), then its net present value (NPV) would be:\nNPV = $36,000 + $36,000/1.1 + $36,000/1.1^2 + $36,000/1.1^3 + $36,000/1.1^4 = $150,000\nConclusion\nAs long as the sales would be consistent for the rest of the 5 years, it would be profitable to buy the coffee shop. However, further analysis should be done on the management experience and the competition to ensure that sales would be consistent.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new business; market sizing.\nConsulting Firm: Strategic Decisions Group (SDG) first round summer internship job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: Education & Training Services.\nCase Interview Question #00642: Our client is Mexican business magnate, investor and philanthropist Mr. Carlos Slim. Mr. Slim has been ranked by Forbes as one of the richest persons in the world since 2010. His extensive holdings in a considerable number of Mexican companies through his conglomerate, Grupo Carso, SA de CV, have amassed interests in the fields of communications, technology, retailing, education and finance.\nIn Mexico, banks prefer not to lend money to not-for-profit institutions like hospitals and schools because if one of these institutions defaults the bank worries that it will be seen as the one responsible for liquidating their assets. We have been approached by Mexican billionaire Mr. Carlos Slim. He is evaluating whether an opportunity exists to start a bank that would lend money to various universities in Mexico. Specifically, there are three questions that Mr. Slim wants us to solve for him:\n\nIs there an opportunity to lend money to universities?\nIf an opportunity exists, how big is it?\nHow should he structure the bank?\n\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate if requested)\nMexico has a population of approximately 110 million as of 2011. Population distribution based on age group is:\n\n 0-15 years old: 20 million\n 15-30 years old: 25 million\n 30-45 years old: 25 million\n 45-60 years old: 20 million\n 60-75 years old: 20 million\n\nPopulation growth: close to 1% (use 1% for the sake of simplicity)\nTotal number of universities in Mexico: 500\nRecommended Approach:\nThe purpose of this case is to test the interviewee’s ability to determine whether it makes sense for the client to open a bank that serves universities. In particular, the interviewee should recognize that he/she needs to gather the necessary information to determine the market opportunity for such a bank. The interviewee should ask questions to gather the necessary information to determine the market size.\nPossible Answer:\nInterviewer: So, given the facts of the case, how would you consider going about analyzing this question for the client Mr. Slim?\nCandidate: I’d like to understand a few things to evaluate this decision.\n\nFirst, I’d like to understand the size of the market to see whether there is an opportunity or not.\nNext I would like to analyze who are the competitors, if any. In particular, I am interested in the competitors because they may decide to offer similar loans to institutions, like universities.\nFinally, I would like to know what the university can leverage from its own operations to develop this idea, etc.\n\nInterviewer: That seems like a good starting point. Let’s start by analyzing the market. How would you do that?\nCandidate: OK, I will start by analyzing in Mexico how many people go to university per year. If the population grows at about 1% per year, this means that next year there could be more people attending universities than space available. I would use a guesstimate of the percent of population enrolled in universities to calculate the number of students currently enrolled across Mexico. For simplicity’s sake I will assume that all potential students attend universities in Mexico, excluding the percent that attends school abroad.\n\n\n\nAge range\nPopulation\n% Enrolled in University (guesstimate)\nEnrolled In University\n\n\n0-15 years old\n20 million\n0%\n0\n\n\n15-30 years old\n25 million\n30%\n25 * 30% = 7.5 million\n\n\n30-45 years old\n25 million\n2%\n25 * 2% = 0.5 million\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n8.0 million\n\n\n\nThere are roughly 25 million Mexicans between the ages of 15 and 30, and I would assume that they are evenly distributed. That is, there are about 25 million / 15 = 1.67 million people in each year of age (e.g. 1.67 million people who are 15 years old, 1.67 million people who are 16 years old, and so on until the age of 30). If I assume that 30% of the people between the ages of 15 and 30 go to university, that means we have 25 * 30% = 7.5 million university students between the ages of 15 and 30.\nInterviewer: Those assumptions seem to be very good ones. What else would you need to consider?\nCandidate: OK, I think that I will need to figure out how many schools there are in Mexico and how many students are enrolled in each school.\nInterviewer: Sure, our client has told us that there are 500 universities in Mexico and we can assume there they are all at full capacity.\nCandidate: OK, so 7.5 million divided by 500 means that there are on average 15,000 students at each school. I might think that this seems like a high number. In the United States we have part-time students and full-time students. If this is similar in Mexico, the universities would likely be able to accommodate more students without any investment.\nInterviewer: No, they can’t do that as the law prohibits it.\nCandidate: OK, so if the population grows at 1% per year and there are no new people going to university for other reasons (e.g. better economy) this means that in any given year we will have 7.5 million multiplied by 1% new students. We would have 75,000 incremental students. Given that we know the schools are at full capacity, we would need 75,000 / 15,000 = 5 new schools.\nInterviewer: OK, so now let’s focus on how would you segment the schools in order to think about the credit scoring they may have?\nCandidate: I would segment them based on three factors:\n\nNew school or just new branch to an existing school. I believe that it is less risky to lend to a company that already has a business in place.\nFlow of people to school: it’s much more secure to lend to a school that has plenty of students in each year than to one that has the same number but distributed in a different way (e.g. most of the people finishing their careers and almost nobody in the first or second year).\nGeography: We are speaking in averages. There may be areas with no population growth. There may be an uneven dispersion.\n\nInterviewer: How would you calculate how much money a typical school would need?\nCandidate: There are two different streams of costs we have to consider. On the one side the cost of building a new school – including buying the land, the construction of buildings, etc. – and one the other side the funds needed until the company reaches a state in which it has a positive free cash flow.\nInterviewer: Great. Tell me the number, or at least how to get it.\nCandidate: The better is to rely on our client’s experience. He has a lot of business holdings, so there are some experiences we can leverage there?\nInterviewer: Let’s move on. How would you fund this project?\nCandidate: I will think about a couple different ideas such as:\n\nUnilateral organizations (e.g. World Bank, etc.)\nThe Government as it may need to help some private schools that focus on careers that are not available through public university.\nBanks: They may not be willing to do this on their own but may want to partner with someone that knows about this industry.\n\nInterviewer: OK, fair enough. Our client Mr. Slim is asking you to summarize the situation. What would be your recommendation?\nCandidate: Can I take a moment to recap all the findings?\nInterviewer: Sure.\nCandidate: I will tell the client that it seems to be a pretty interesting opportunity to provide capital to build new schools which would be at least 5 per year given the 1% annual growth in the population.\nInterviewer: Very good. Thank you for your analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new business; quantitative case, math problem.\nConsulting Firm: Siemens Management Consulting first round summer internship job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: freight delivery, shipping services; small business, startups.\nCase Interview Question #00640: The client Zipments is a British startup company based in a small village 300 miles away from Central London. The company provides local businesses and individuals with fast and affordable package delivery and courier service. After receiving fundings from a prominent venture capital firm, the CEO and Founder of Zipments recently has hired your consulting team to help them decide how many delivery trucks to lease.\nThere are three different truck models available, but our client has been told that he will need to have a consistent fleet, meaning they can only lease one model type. So, we will also need to identify what model he should lease for his company. This company provides the local delivery of packages sent to this village through UPS next-day delivery service.\nHow would you suggest approaching the client’s problem?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate if requested)\n1. A quick overview of how the Zipments company operates:\n\n They receive every package at 5pm from UPS\n a bunch of people hired by the company then sort the packages and\n load them on a truck where they are stored overnight\n then they deliver the packages starting at 9am for 10 hours.\n\n2. The startup company Zipments operates five days a week: Monday – Friday\n\n Number of packages delivered per day: 1,000.\n Dimension of package (envelope) is 1 * 1 * 1.\n It takes 8 minutes, on average, to deliver a single package and to be ready for the next one (“assume they deliver one every 8 minutes”).\n\n3. There are three different truck models available for lease:\n\n Truck A costs $150 per day and its dimensions are 3 * 4 * 5.\n Truck B costs $40 per day and its dimensions are 9 * 2 * 1.\n Truck C costs $130 per day and its dimensions are double the size of truck A, or 6 * 8 * 10\n\nDrivers, fuel, etc. are not considered and do not make a material difference to the analysis (for the sake of simplicity). The case will also include additional questions not addressed in the initial scope.\nPossible Answer:\nThis quantitative case tests a candidate’s ability to analyze how many packages must be delivered and to see if the bottleneck is the time or the truck size. Not all information is provided up front to the candidate; he/she should be aware of this and must identify additional data that will allow him/her to solve the case.\nInterviewer: So, how would you go about analyzing this problem?\nCandidate: I’d like to understand a few things to evaluate this decision. First, I would like to start by analyzing the demand. I would like to know how many packages we have to deliver and how long, on average, it would take us to deliver a single package. Then, I would like to analyze the numbers in the context of the three truck models our client can lease.\nInterviewer: OK. We can satisfy a demand of 1,000 packages per day and it takes 8 minutes on average to deliver each one.\nCandidate: So, 8 minutes per package * 1,000 packages / 60 minutes per hour  / 10 hours = 13.3 trucks. So we need at least 14 trucks. I would like to think about the leases we can consider.\nInterviewer: Ok. Let me show you the information we received from the client:\n\n\n\nTruck\nCost per day\nDimensions\n\n\nA\n$150\n3*4*5\n\n\nB\n$40\n9*2*1\n\n\nC\n$130\n6*8*10\n\n\n\nTruck A cost $150 per day and its dimensions (for the packages) are 3*4*5. Oh, by the way, you did not ask about the average size of an envelope, but our client has told us that the average size is 1*1*1.\nCandidate: OK, so when assessing Truck A we multiply 1,000 (total packages for all trucks) by 1*1*1 (average package size) and divide by 3*4*5. We will know how many trucks we would need of the Truck A model. My calculations show 1000/(3*4*5) = 16.6 which would mean we would need 17 of this type of truck. As 17 is more than the time constraint of 14 truck to ensure on-time delivery, we stick with 17.\nSo, this is the result of performing this analysis for each type of truck:\n\n\n\nTruck\nCost per day\nDimensions\n# trucks (rounded)\n# trucks (minimum)\nTotal cost per day\n\n\nA\n$150\n3*4*5\n1000/(3*4*5) = 17\n17\n$150 * 17 = $2,550\n\n\nB\n$40\n9*2*1\n1000/(9*2*1) = 56\n56\n$40 * 56 = $2,240\n\n\nC\n$130\n6*8*10\n1000/(6*8*10) = 3\n14\n$130 * 14 = $1,820\n\n\n\nNow, from a pure financial analysis, I would recommend leasing 14 trucks of the C Model because it will allow our client to minimize the cost while ensuring on-time delivery (customer satisfaction). On the other hand, we also might consider that there would be plenty of room for delivering other things if they can figure out how in the future.\nInterviewer: OK, it seems a good idea. Let’s move on to the next part of the case. Now imagine 6 months have passed and your recommendation was pretty successful. Now the CEO of the Zipments startup want us to investigate any potential risks that he should be assessing/considering.\nCandidate: Can I take a minute to organize my thoughts?\nInterviewer: OK.\nCandidate: So, I would like to go over this problem by analyzing both internal and external factors. Here is a list of the things I would think about:\nInternal\n\n Need for extra drivers (e.g., people get sick) – do we have enough employees\n Unionized drivers may shift labor cost up in the future\n Need to lease more trucks because trucks can break down causing late delivery\n Insurance costs\n Extra fine tickets than forecasted because drivers want to deliver on time\n\nExternal\n\n Only one supplier (UPS) – we are captive to UPS\n Adoption of new technology (e-mail) might reduce the need for sending packages\n Government regulation\n New competition in the city – there are no real barriers to entry, since UPS would likely partner with any carrier who can deliver on customer service metrics at a cheaper cost\n No association with our brand, thus our supplier can switch to our competitors or start its own operation\n\nObviously, I could analyze the sorting operation more to make a more profound (exhaustive) analysis but that was not covered on our initial discussion.\nInterviewer: Don’t go that direction. Let’s think of another scenario. Now we have to investigate sources for profit growth for this startup company with one restriction, we can neither add new truck leases nor change the existing ones.\nCandidate: OK. Let me think about increasing revenues:\n\nExtend hours: the trucks are already paid for the day, if we extend the delivery time after 7pm we can deliver more of UPS or from other companies, even local companies. That would go (impact) directly to profits.\nDifferent packages: we may recommend to UPS to sell different (more robust) packages to some clients and get part of it.\nPick packages: every time we leave a package we make space to pick a package and deliver it to another part of the village or to give it back to UPS to send it to another place.\nGet contract with a new operator: see whether we can deliver stuff to other company who is in the delivery business but does not compete directly with UPS.\nSince we can not add new trucks we can think about utilization of current trucks.\nAdvertisement: are the trucks painted with UPS logos? We can sell advertisement to them or to other companies. Those trucks are all day in the street.\nInsurance: offer insurance of packages to clients.\n\nInterviewer: What else?\nCandidate: We can also think about streamlining operations (reducing costs). I would think about them in terms of fixed and variable costs.\n\nEvaluate the route of each truck to reduce time or usage of gas (fuel)\nImprove technology usage in the sorting and loading packages. May reduce number of people at the factory\nRe-negotiate leasing terms for trucks\nMove warehouse to a cheaper place\n\nInterviewer: OK, we are running out of time, but thank you for the list of business challenges that the client should assess, I am sure that some of these will lead to very interesting discussions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: improve profitability.\nConsulting Firm: Siemens Management Consulting second round summer internship job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: consumer electronics; household goods, home appliances\nCase Interview Question #00639: The client LG Electronics (LSE: LGLD) is a multinational electronics company headquartered in Yeouido-dong, Seoul, South Korea and the flagship subsidiary of the LG Group conglomerate. The company operates its business through five divisions: Mobile Communications, Home Entertainment, Home Appliances, Air Conditioning, and Energy Solutions. For this case, we will focus on only one subsidiary of LG Electronics that produces home applicances.\nThis company is a manufacturer and distributor of high-end refrigerators in India. It operates in the Indian market only. Recently the company CEO has hired Siemens Management Consulting to help them solve a profitability problem. Two years ago the company had a record year in terms of growth. Though they were correct in  understanding the size of the market and how it would grow, their gross profit decreased by approximately 70%. The CEO of the refrigerator company is very worried about the situation. The client has asked us to identify what happened and what can be done to restore profitability. How would you go about this case?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate if requested)\n\n1 billion people in India\nTwo years ago units sales in India were 5 million and last year were 6 million\nThe client’s company builds and sells high-end units only\n\nPossible Answer:\nThis is a typical profitability case question. A good way to go over it is to break down the profit equation into the different concepts, build hypothesis, and test them: Profits = Revenues – Costs.\nCandidate: Can I take a minute to think about this problem?\nInterviewer: Yes.\nCandidate: OK, I would start by breaking down the profitability problem into revenues and costs in order to identify the potential drivers of the drop in profitability.\nInterviewer: Great. Let’s start with the costs.\nCandidate: OK. Given that we know that this market has been growing quickly, I would like to know whether our client has decided to build a new factory to keep up with the growth. If that was the case, depreciation and amortization and interest on debt (if it was paid by issuing debt) could be putting pressure on the profit of the firm.\nInterviewer: You are definitively right in your analysis, but I have to tell you that although they have built a new plant, there is no problem on the cost side. I can tell you that since we have just finished another engagement in which we streamlined all his operations.\nCandidate: So, now I would like to understand a little more about the revenue side of the profit equation. Perhaps I could learn a little more about the market. I’m most interested in having some assumptions to determine the size of the market.\nInterviewer: Sure. What do you want? If you ask for specific information I may have it.\nCandidate: OK, I would like to know the population of India, the number of households and what kind of refrigerators the client produces.\nInterviewer: Currently India’s population is about 1.2 billion. Let’s use 1 billion people for the sake of simplicity. And I am not sure about households, just guess something.\nCandidate: I would say that there might be 5 or 6 people per household, which leads to 200 million households. Based on my experience I will say people change their refrigerator once every 5 to 8 years.\nInterviewer: Sounds reasonable, let’s say 8 years.\nCandidate: If I had the number of units sold in the market last year I would be able to understand how many people actually have refrigerators at home in India. Do we have any information around the percent of households that have a refrigerator?\nInterviewer: Last year refrigerator sales were 6 million units and one year before they were 5 million units.\nCandidate: So we have\n\n\n\nYear\n# sold\nYears between change\nMarket size\n\n\nTwo years ago\n5,000,000\n8\n40,000,000\n\n\nLast year\n6,000,000\n8\n48,000,000\n\n\n\nInterviewer: You are saying that the number of refrigerators for home-use was 40 millions two years ago and 48 millions last year?\nCandidate: Yes. However, I might question whether the 8 million growth of last year could have been in a segment not served by your client.\nInterviewer: How do you know that?\nCandidate: Well, we concluded that there are 200 million households and from our estimation we get that only 48/200 = 24% have a refrigerator. On the other hand you mentioned that the client produces only high-end refrigerators which may signal that the growth is coming from the low income part of the society, for which your product may not be priced at a competitive level or even the product not designed for their needs.\nInterviewer: You are completely right. What we should do?\nCandidate: There are several options. Our client can try to use the extra capacity they have in the new plant to focus on building lower-end refrigerators, leveraging their supplier relationships, dealers, etc. However, we would need to consider how to brand these refrigerators so as to not detract from the quality brand image associated with the higher end of the market.\nThey can think about exporting the extra capacity to other countries like China where their product offering is competitive and there is market for growth, they can start offering financing for this particular segment.\nInterviewer: Fair enough, let’s imagine that the marketing director came last night and proposed to reduce their high-end refrigerator price by 20% to appeal to this segment, which he thinks will increase sales by 30%. Should we support him?\nCandidate: Is that all the information we have?\nInterviewer: Yes.\nCandidate: Let me think. Let’s denote P = Price, C = Cost of goods sold (COGS), Q = Quantity. The general formula to make this decision should be P * Q – C * Q > 0. In this case:\n80%*P * 130%*Q – C * 130%*Q > 0\n104% * PQ – 130% * CQ > 0\nBreak-even point at:\n104% * PQ = 130% * CQ\n104%*P = C*130%\n104% / 130% = C/P\nC/P = 80%\nCOGS of 80% over price does not seem to be completely out of what we would expect in a manufacturing company. I would worry about COGS being just 25%, which will signal that reducing price by 20% is not a good idea to attain 30% more sales.\nInterviewer: Thanks. Let’s wrap it up here. Can you summarize your findings for the CEO?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

It is the largest European manufacturer of wind turbines. The company currently operates manufacturing plants in Denmark, Germany, Italy, Romania, Britain, Spain, Sweden, and Norway, and employs more than 20,000 people globally.\nWind energy is currently growing very rapidly in China and in the US. By the end of year 2012, there will be capacity issues in the US. The client Vestas Wind Systems currently has production capability in the US and would like to enter the US market. The CEO of Vestas has elicited your consulting team to help determine two issues:\n\nWhere to build its manufacturing plant in the US?\nHow many manufacturing plants to build?\n\nThis case only concerns North American Operations. How would you go about helping solve the client’s problem?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate upon request)\n\nImporting wind turbines from Europe to the US or to Asia is impractical because each wind turbine weights 80 tons and there are very high import tariffs that add additional costs.\nThe US manufacturing plant will be online by 2013 and the expected demand for our client’s products is 1,500 units. If prompted this is 40% of the total market size.\nMarket growth for the next 5-8 years is 10% by volume.\nThere are 2 existing US manufacturers (General Electric, United Technologies Corporation) of wind turbines with General Electric being the dominant player. There is no differentiation between the different wind turbine products.\n\nPossible Structure for the solution: use to guide the candidate\n\n\n\nKey Areas\nGuidance for each area (do not read verbatim)\n\n\nPart & Material Supply\n\n\nFactors: infrastructure, labor, tax, competition, etc.\nThe candidate should realize that the competition is competent and seek to understand from where they currently source.\nCompetition sources from the Midwest (heavy auto supply base).\nShipping costs and an integrated supplier network are most important drivers.\n\n\n\n\nManufacturing\n\n\nAssembly is not terribly complex (low tech). Once the different sub-assemblies are in house, the manufacturing is simple mechanical assembly (very little welding or complex process).\nAll Vestas’ engineering design is done in Europe.\nProduct mix – only one type of turbine is currently slated for production in the US.\n\n\n\n\nTransport\n\n\nTransport the finished wind turbines must be by rail to achieve any efficiency.\nNeed to understand where the demand is. Building the plant closer to the areas of heavy demand will reduce transportation costs.\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nCustomers will be required to perform their own installation.\nOur client Vestas provides nominal support when required but installation is not difficult.\n\n\n\n\nService\n\n\nOur client Vestas is interested primarily in making and selling wind turbines.\nRoutine maintenance can be performed fairly easily by any trained technician. There are numerous independent contractors that are licensed to repair the wind turbines (fragmented market, low barrier to entry – unattractive market)\n\n\n\n\n\nPossible Answer:\nWe first need to understand the demand for wind turbines and the market share that our client Vestas Wind Systems can achieve. Being a growing market I would also want to assess the market growth rate. This will help us understand if we need additional capacity.\nThen I would continue by assessing if we actually need a manufacturing plant in the US. Maybe we can import wind turbines from other locations at cheaper cost that opening a new plant.\nIn order to try to suggest a location for the plant we need to understand some of the factors that will influence this new location:\n\nWhere the supply will be coming form, taking into account infrastructure, labor, taxes, competition, shipping costs, etc.\nWhere the customers are located\nWhat level of service we need to provide to these customers\nIs it possible to outsource manufacturing\nWhere the manufacturing costs are cheapest\n\nThe last component that cannot be ignored is competition. We need to know how segmented the market is and how the competition is doing.\nTaking into account that China is the second fastest growing market for wind energy, I would also like to assess the possibility of exporting wind turbines to China.\nInterviewer Notes: (not to be given to candidate)\n1. US Market Share of Wind Energy by Region (Figure 1)\n\nThe candidate should attempt to understand how demand is distributed and rationalize the manufacturing location with the Midwest supply base.\nThe candidate should also recognize that the plant site must be located near the supply base, but tend towards the est to be closer to demand.\nSupply base is the region that contains the majority of plants that would supply the constituent parts for the wind turbine assembly.\n\n2. Economies of Scale\nThe candidate should immediately ask how economies of scale affect the production costs of each wind turbine. Chart to be given only upon request: Figure 2. Relative effect of plant scale on costs (Cost Per Unit vs. Annual Plant Capacity)\n\nOther Additional Information to be given upon request:\n\nA 1,500 units plant would cost $40 million dollars investment ($30 million being the building). Each additional 500 units in capacity will increase the costs by $15 million.\nIf 2 plants were built, the additional operation costs would be $15 million per year. The transportation savings would be $7 million per year.\nNote that we cannot build a plant with a lower than 1,500 units capacity.\n\nCalculation of Future Demand Growth:\nFuture Demand Projection\n\n\n\nYear\nClient’s share**\nMarket*\n\n\n2013\n1,500\n3,750\n\n\n2014\n1,650\n4,125\n\n\n2015\n1,815\n4,538\n\n\n2016\n1,997\n4,991\n\n\n2017\n2,196\n5,490\n\n\n2018\n2,416\n6,039\n\n\n2019\n2,657\n6,643\n\n\n2020\n2,923\n7,308\n\n\n\n* based on 10% market size growth\n** based on a constant market share of 40%\nFor 3,000 units capacity (the capacity that the client will need to have by year 2020 with a 10% increase in the market size and same market share of 40%):\n\nIf only one plant built:\nCost = $40 + $15 * 3 = $85 million\nNote that the capacity does not have to be added from the beginning and the high capacity will decrease the cost per unit\nIf 2 plants built:\nCost = $40 * 2 + ($15 – $7) * 8 years= $144 million\n\nA good candidate will make a Final Recommendation:\nWith all these information my recommendation is for them to build one plant that should be located near but to the southwest of the Midwest supply base. I suggest only one plant because the costs associated with building and operating 2 plants are much higher than for only one plant. However this plant needs to be sized to accommodate the future growth (approximately 100% increase by year 2020 given no increase in market share). Even in this case, the costs are a lot higher for having two plants over one plant.\nThere are some other risk associated with this decision that were not taken into account here, like competition. We would need to assess the competitive response and the effect it will have on the market share.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: operations strategy, supply chain optimization; new product.\nConsulting Firm: Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) first round summer internship job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: aerospace & defense; airlines.\nCase Interview Question #00624: Our client Airbus SAS is an aircraft manufacturing subsidiary of EADS (European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company, Euronext: EAD), an European aerospace and defense company. Based in Blagnac, France, a suburb of Toulouse, and with significant activity across Europe, Airbus produces approximately half of the world’s jet airliners.\nThe A380 is a new double-deck, wide-body, four-engine jet airliner manufactured by the Airbus company. It is the world’s largest passenger airliner which is able to hold up approximately 800-900 people. For instance, the Airbus A380-800 provides seating for up to 853 people in all-economy class configurations, and the future version A380-900 will have a seating capacity of approximately 900 passengers in economy-only configuration.\nOriginally designed to challenge Boeing Company (NYSE: BA)’s monopoly in the large-aircraft market, the Airbus A380 made its initial flight on 27 April 2005 and entered initial commercial service in October 2007 with Singapore Airlines. Parts for the A380 airplane are manufactured in multiple sites across Europe. The client Airbus has provided us the following information on site production:\n\nCockpits (flight deck, the area usually near the front of an aircraft from which a pilot controls the aircraft) are produced in Northern Spain\nThe fuselage (an aircraft’s main body section that holds crew and passengers or cargo) is produced in Northern Germany\nWings are produced in Northern England\nLanding Gears/Interior are produced in Southern France\n\nThe client Airbus has asked us to determine where it is most economical to assemble the A380 airplane. How would you go about the case?\nSuggested Approach:\nThis is an operations strategy case with a major focus on supply chain optimization. It involves the application of processes and tools to ensure the optimal operation of a manufacturing and distribution supply chain. This includes the optimal placement of inventory within the supply chain, minimizing operating costs, including manufacturing costs, transportation costs, and distribution costs. The candidate should form a structured approach to investigate the components that make up assembly, including costs and capabilities.\nPossible Solution:\nInterviewer: So, how would you determine the most economical site to assemble the A380?\nCandidate: Well, I would like to look into the specific costs incurred from the A380 assembly process and also determine the capabilities for assembling the planes across different locations (labor skill and supply, etc).\nInterviewer: OK, I like your approach. Let’s focus on costs for now.\nCandidate: Great. I assume that the major costs of assembly would be transportation, labor, and PP&E (property, plant and equipment). Also, I would think that there would be tax incentives to assembling in one country versus another.\nInterviewer: Good. Let’s focus on transportation and labor for now, as these are the most significant cost drivers. What are some of the areas that you might analyze for potential assembly locations?\nCandidate: I would look at the existing sites where our client manufactures parts, as well as other areas in the region that may have low cost propositions, such as Eastern European countries that may have cheaper labor costs than Western Europe.\nInterviewer: Let’s take France as one location since it is the mid-point of the four manufacturing locations and compare it to the Czech Republic where labor is significantly less expensive than Western Europe.\nCandidate: Well, the location in France would incur less cost because the client would already have the landing gears and interior at the facility, and would have to transport the other three parts over a shorter distance. However, the labor costs in France would likely be significantly higher than those in the Czech Republic. Do we have any information about transportation and labor costs in each of these areas?\nInterviewer: Well, we have determined that labor accounts for about 70% of the total costs of assembly and transportation accounts for the other 30%. Disregard the other costs such as real estate, etc.\nCandidate: Great. Since labor accounts for 70% of the cost, let’s start there. Do we have any details about how much labor costs in the Czech Republic relative to France?\nInterviewer: Labor in France is 1.5 times higher than labor in the Czech Republic. What do you think that total transportation costs would be in France relative to the Czech Republic?\nCandidate: Since these parts are so large, I would assume that a major part of transportation is actually packing and loading the pieces on a large truck.\nInterviewer: You’re right. In fact, the marginal cost of each extra mile transported is close to zero. The most significant cost incurred is labor costs associated with the loading of parts for transportation.\nCandidate: I would assume that the landing gears and interior are fairly small and wouldn’t incur as large expenses for loading/unloading compared to the wings or the fuselage.\nInterviewer: You’re right. In fact, the interior and the gears are the easiest to pack of all the four parts and the fuselage is the hardest (most expensive). What would you recommend to our client Airbus?\nCandidate: Well, I would recommend they assemble the A380 airplane in the Czech Republic. Since labor accounts for 70% of the total cost, and the labor in Czech Republic is about 33% less expensive than France, the client would save a significant amount of money, assuming that the skill level is constant across the two locations.\nAdditionally, the transportation costs would not be lower in France since the majority of transportation expense is incurred by loading/unloading the parts and the interior/gears are the easiest to pack. It might be worthwhile to analyze Germany as a potential assembly location because the fuselage represents a significant portion of our transportation costs. The transportation savings may balance out the higher cost of labor in Germany (as compared to Eastern Europe).\nInterviewer: Very good. One last question – our client Airbus knows the demand for A380 jumbo jet will be 100 airplanes per year and they are trying to determine how large a new assembly facility they should build. How would you go about figuring this out?\nAdditional Information: (Candidate should ask for this data)\n\nIt takes 9 months to assemble one A380 plane\nOne A380 airplane requires a space of about 300 feet by 300 feet\n\nCandidate: Well, we know that it takes 9 months or 0.75 of a year to produce one A380 airplane, so we need space to produce 75 planes in the facility (100 * 0.75 = 75). Also, one plane requires 300 * 300 = 90,000 square foot of space. So the total assembly facility would need to be 75 planes * 90,000 sq. ft. per plane = 6.75 million sq. ft.\nInterviewer: Excellent. Let’s wrap it up here. (The interviewee will now be asked to summarize high level findings and make a recommendation to the client Airbus regarding where it should produce and assemble A380 airplanes and the requirements for this assembly facility and operation).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: operations strategy, supply chain optimization.\nConsulting Firm: A.T. Kearney first round summer internship interview.\nIndustry Coverage: retail.\nCase Interview Question #00625: Trader Joe’s is a privately held chain of specialty grocery stores headquartered in Monrovia, California. As of February 2012, Trader Joe’s had a total of more than 360 stores. Approximately half of its stores are in California, with the heaviest concentration in Southern California, but the company also has store locations in 30 other states and Washington, D.C. The Trader Joe’ chain has offices in both Monrovia, California and Boston, Massachusetts.\nDescribing itself as “your neighborhood grocery store” or “your unique grocery store”, Trader Joe’s stores sell mostly private label staple foods, organic foods, and specialty products. Unlike typical grocery stores, which may carry 50,000 items (or SKUs), Trader Joe’s stocks about 4,000 items, 80% of which bear one of its own brand names.\nYou are a consultant working with A.T. Kearney. The other day you were on the golf course with billionaire businessman Mr. Theo Albrecht, who owns the Trader Joe’s chain. Mr. Albrecht posed a question that you found very interesting. His question was, why should he continue to centralize his company’s sourcing rather than split it to procurement and distribution at the individual store level. How would you best assess the question?\nPossible Solution:\nThis is a pure conceptual “supply chain optimization” case in which the candidate will have to come up with a number of reasons to go one way or the other. Be creative in the way you think about it, the case is open ended, but look for guidance from the interviewer if you start to go too far.\nCandidate: May I take some time to think about how to go over this problem?\nInterviewer: Sure, take your time…..So, why should he centralize sourcing and distribution?\nCandidate: In order to come with an answer I would like to go over the pros and cons of centralizing and then weigh them in order to come with an answer.\nInterviewer: Fine with me.\nCandidate:\nPros\n\nAbility to “squeeze” suppliers by aggregating demand\nFlexibility to change what to deliver to individual stores based on daily or weekly demand changes\nEconomies of scale in warehouse size, operation, etc.\nReduce cost of warehouse by having it in a low cost area and not in the store, which I assume is a high cost area\nLocal people (at the store level) are not trained to negotiate. Having them at the store level is an extra cost\n\nCons\n\nLocal people can understand better the necessities (e.g.: because of format, size, place) for some niche categories\nIf distributed directly to the store the cost of distribution is paid by the supplier\nThere may be some products that are not bought at the centralized (headquarter) level because of limited size order. Managing at the store level make it viable.\n\nInterviewer: All good reasons, but say you have talked to Mr. Albrecht about many of those things and he keeps telling you that there may be something else. What could it be?\nCandidate: So, we have covered most things and we are still not finding the reason?\nInterviewer: Yes.\nCandidate: Looking at the ideas that I put in the pros vs. cons comparison, it could be similar to the notion of some products not being bought at the headquarter because of some quantities asked for an individual store. What if the supplier refuses to ship to individual stores because of limited volume? He may not have the trucks to do so in such a small volume or he may be unwilling to do so because is not profitable to do in that way.\nInterviewer: You got to the point. This was one of the cases I worked on. After a couple of hours in the golf course with my friend I actually came to the same conclusion, which later he validated with his team as the main reason. You did a great job. Thank you for your time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: pricing & valuation; new product.\nConsulting Firm: FTI Consulting first round summer internship job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: healthcare: pharmaceutical, biotech, life sciences.\nCase Interview Question #00626: Our client Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. (NYSE: VRX, TSX: VRX) is a Canadian pharmaceutical company with activities spanning the drug discovery pipeline from target identification through clinical trials and commercialization. Headquartered in Laval, Quebec, the company’s focus is on neurology, dermatology and infectious disease with several drugs in late stage clinical trials.\nValeant’s first drug has just been approved by Health Canada, the equivalent to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is a new treatment for asthma. The client Valeant Pharmaceuticals has hired FTI Consulting to help them assess what is the right price for this new treatment and they will also need FTI Consulting’s help with completing an application to the Canadian government for price approval. The second step is necessary because, as you may know, Canada’s government subsidizes healthcare costs and we will discuss this in greater detail later in the case.\nHow would you go about this case?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate if requested)\nThe candidate should consider what additional information will be necessary to address this case and ask for the data as they see fit.\n\nResearch and Development (R&D) costs for this new asthma drug are estimated to be $5 billion.\nBeyond R&D, marketing is the largest cost for a new pharmaceutical. The interviewer, however, will ask the interviewee to assume that marketing costs are $0 at this stage and there are no variable costs.\nThere are three segments to the asthma market:\n\n Basic – 2% of the population – have a periodic asthma attack, use 1 inhaler per month\n Serious – 2% of the population – use 1 inhaler per week\n Acute – 1% of the population – use 1 inhaler per week, but attack sometimes results in hospitalization or even death.\n\n\nThe client Valeant Pharmaceuticals’ new treatment is classified as preventative. It is a pill that must be taken every day.\nRegular inhalers cost $10 each. This is the common treatment for asthma.\nAcute patients that result in hospitalization spend on average 1 night/year in the hospital at $1,000 and the rate of death is 1%.\n\nPossible Solution:\nInterviewer: First, let’s discuss the possible ways of framing the client’s first question – how should it price this new asthma drug?\nCandidate: Well, for pricing there are three different methods I can think of:\nCost based pricing – set the drug price at cost and add a percentage markup\nValue based pricing – set it at what customers are willing to pay\nDetermine Minimum and Maximum prices\nInterviewer: Great, now, can you go through the steps to solve this problem and provide a price to the client?\nCandidate: OK, so let’s try cost based pricing first. I would assume that the company has both fixed costs and variable costs. Have we gathered any information from the client about its cost structure?\nInterviewer: Well, what do you think would be its largest costs?\nCandidate: Given what I know about the pharmaceutical industry and the extensive R&D for drugs, I would guess Research and Development.\nInterviewer: Good, R&D costs are $5 billion. What would you guess are some other key categories of costs?\nCandidate: Marketing is usually a big cost.\nInterviewer: Right. For this case, let’s assume marketing is $0 and there are no variable costs. (Where possible, the candidate could have tried to anticipate this chain of questions and suggested, without being asked, the key categories of costs that might be relevant)\nCandidate: Next, I would want to size the Canadian market for this new asthma drug, assuming that we will only sell it in Canada. To do this, let’s say the population of Canada is approximately 30 million people. We would now need to estimate the percentage of the population that is asthmatics?\nInterviewer: You’re right. There are 3 segments to this market:\n\nBasic – 2% of the population – have a periodic asthma attack, use 1 inhaler/month.\nSerious – 2% of the population – use 1 inhaler/week.\nAcute – 1% of the population – use 1 inhaler/week, but attack sometimes results in hospitalization or even death.\n\nAlso, the client’s new treatment is preventative. It is a pill that must be taken every day.\nCandidate: OK, so let’s assume every segment will use this new drug. 30 million * 5% = 1.5 million people. However, I would expect that there would be some barriers to switching and not all potential users will switch from inhalers.\nInterviewer: OK, so now how do you set the price?\nCandidate: I want to determine the price to break-even. For a pharmaceutical company, I think 5 years is acceptable.\n\nTo break even in 5 years: 1.5 million * Total Revenue = $5 billion (R&D)\nTotal Revenue = $5 billion / 1.5 million = $3,300\nUse 350 days per year for simplicity, one pill every day over 5 years = 350 * 5 = 1,750 pills\n$3,300 / 1,750 pills = approximately $2/pill\n\nInterviewer: So, do you think this price should be the minimum or the maximum?\nCandidate: This is the minimum because it is the break-even price.\nInterviewer: OK, now let’s consider the second half of the case. As I mentioned, the Canadian government subsidized medical costs, let’s for the sake of this case say that it pays back its citizens for medical treatments. How do you determine how to set the price so that the government will agree to pay it?\nCandidate: Assuming that the Canadian government is paying for the current treatment, I would want to know their current spend and determine what the difference is between that and the new drug. Do you know how much the government is currently paying asthma patients for their inhalers?\nInterviewer: The cost of inhalers is $10 each. Also, acute patients that result in hospitalization spend on average 1 night/year in the hospital at $1,000 and the rate of death is 1%.\nCandidate: So I want to determine how much the government is currently spending on inhalers.\n\nBasic: 30 million * 2% = 600,000 people, 1 inhaler per month, 600,000 * $10 * 12 = $72 million total\nSerious: 30 million * 2% = 600,000 people, 1 inhaler per week, 600,000 * $10 * 52 = $312 million total\nAcute: 30 million * 1% = 300,000 people, 1 inhaler per week, 300,000 * $10 * 52 = $156 million total\n\nTotal government is spending on inhalers: $72 + $312 + $156 = $540 million a year.\nNow I want to determine how much the government is spending on hospitalizations.\n$1,000 per night * 1 night/year * 300,000 people = $300 million/year\nTotal government spend = $540 million + $300 million = $840 million\nOver five years: $840 million * 5 = $4.2 billion\nSo with the new drug, we calculated the break-even at five years to cover $5 billion in R&D. With inhalers, in five years, the government is spending $4.2 billion.\nInterviewer: Good, so with this information, summarize for me the minimum and maximum price.\nThe candidate should now summarize results to the interviewer and state what you think the minimum and maximum prices should be. Make sure to note that the new pill is a preventative measure, as opposed to the current method of using inhalers as treatment. A good summary will be structured and go back through the steps used in solving the case. At this point you can also bring in other parameters that may not have been discussed in the case such as the price on-patent versus off-patent, or the potential larger international market for this drug.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

It is the world’s sixth largest airline measured by passengers carried, and Asia’s largest airline in terms of both fleet size and passengers carried. China Southern Airlines is one of China’s “Big Three” airlines, alongside Air China and China Eastern Airlines. From its main hubs at Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport and Beijing Capital International Airport, the airline flies to 121 destinations.\nThe client already operates two daily flights from Guangzhou, China to Sydney, Australia, offering connections to Perth, Sydney. The CEO of China Southern Airlines has hired your consulting firm Bain to evaluate a new direct flight between Guangzhou and Perth. Should they create this new route from Guangzhou to Perth?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate if requested)\n1. Market\n\n At this point there is no other airline flying from Guangzhou to Perth, and there is only one competitor Qantas Airways flying from Guangzhou to Sydney. Sydney to Perth is a domestic route with one competitor.\n The market grows with GDP.\n 15% of passengers from Guangzhou to Sydney (or return) have Perth as the original or final destination\n China Southern Airlines’ current load factor in Guangzhou to Sydney flight is 80%\n Ticket price to fly from Guangzhou to Sydney or Guangzhou to Perth is $600 one way\n\n2. Flight distance\n\n Guangzhou – Sydney = 4,800 miles\n Guangzhou – Perth = 3,800 miles\n Sydney – Perth = 2,350 miles\n\n3. Aircraft type\n\n Airbus 319 (120 seats) has a maximum fly range of 4,000 miles\n Airbus 320 (165 seats) has a maximum fly range of 6,000 miles\n Airbus 330 (240 seats) has a maximum fly range of 7,000 miles\n\n4. Costs\n\n Airbus 319 (120 seats) has a fixed cost of $41,000\n Airbus 320 (165 seats) has a fixed cost of $62,000\n\nPossible Answer:\nInterviewer: So, how would you go about analyzing this case?\nCandidate: (Summarize the case and work on a framework) This case requires us to estimate the potential market size of route Guangzhou-Perth, the growth opportunity, the competition as well as our client’s resources. Also, any legal or governmental issue should be discussed.\nInterviewer: OK. How would you estimate the market size (demand) for the Guangzhou-Perth route? What do you need to know? I have been working with this client for a long time and might have the needed information.\nCandidate: Although we could estimate the size of the market, it might be more reasonable to look at the current information the client company has about the indirect route. I would believe many passengers already fly from Perth to Guangzhou by connecting flights in Sydney, right?\nInterviewer: Correct.\nCandidate: So I would like to find out the number of flights per day, the number of passengers per flight and the percent of these passengers that actually have Perth as the origin or destination.\nInterviewer: Very well thought. It is a smart decision to start more conservative. Our client China Southern Airlines currently flies twice a day from Guangzhou to Sydney and back. It currently operates Airbus 320 in this route, with 80% load factor. 15% of the passengers have Perth as the origin or destination. I can also tell you some aircraft limitations:\n\nAirbus 319 (120 seats) has a maximum fly range of 4,000 miles\nAirbus 320 (165 seats) has a maximum fly range of 6,000 miles\nAirbus 330 (240 seats) has a maximum fly range of 7,000 miles\n\nCandidate: This gives us 165 * 80% = 132 passengers per flight or 132 * 2 = 264 passengers per day (one way), of which 15% or 40 have Perth as the origin (and final destination). We should have in mind that if the client offers the new Guangzhou-Perth direct flight, it will reduce the load factor of the Guangzhou-Sydney route from 80% to 68%.\nAside from our own cannibalization, I would expect that by offering this new route our client China Southern Airlines will be able to take customers from its competitors, right? Actually, does the client have any competition on its current routes?\nInterviewer: There is only one competitor flying from Guangzhou to Sydney, but this competitor has a code-share agreement with a domestic airline that flies from Sydney to Perth. From Guangzhou to Sydney the competitor flies an A330 (240 seats) daily with the same 80% load factor. Also, 15% of its passengers have Perth as the origin or final destination.\nCandidate: This gives us an additional 240 * 80% * 15% = 30 passengers/day. Before we conclude that our client will be able to steal these customers from the competition, let’s analyze the pricing points. Do you have any information of prices?\nInterviewer: Both our client and the competitor charge $600 per one way from Guangzhou to Sydney or Guangzhou to Perth.\nCandidate: It is interesting to see that the passenger pays the same fare to fly from Guangzhou to Sydney (4,800 miles) and from Guangzhou to Perth (4,800 + 2,350 = 7,150 miles). So basically we have the same price and potentially a faster trip. Unless we find any competitive advantage other than travel time, we could assume our client is able to steal all the Guangzhou-Perth customers from the competitor.\nI would also imagine that by entering into this route our client would have first-mover advantage and the competitor would not enter this route if they didn’t think that it could steal share from our client.\nInterviewer: This makes sense. Basically you have estimated a conservative demand. What else would you analyze?\nCandidate: We know the potential demand; although there is an expected growth in the industry let’s see whether this route would be currently profitable. What do we know about the cost structure?\nInterviewer: The total fixed cost of operating A319 and A320 are $41,000 per flight and $62,000 per flight respectively. There are some variable costs, but they are marginal.\nCandidate: Basically for route Guangzhou-Sydney the client must use an A320, but A319 is an option for route Guangzhou-Perth. Let’s analyze the daily revenue, cost, and profit for each route:\nRevenues from Guangzhou to Sydney: (165 * 80% * 85%) * $600 = $67,320\nCost for Guangzhou to Sydney: $62,000 (A320)\nProfit: $67,320 – $62,000 = $5,320\nProfit margin: $5,320 / $67,320 ~= 8%\nRevenues from Guangzhou to Perth: (40 + 30) * $600 = $42,000\nCost for Guangzhou to Perth: $41,000 (A319)\nProfit: $42,000 – $41,000 = $1,000\nProfit margin” $1,000 / $42,000 ~= 2.4%\nI am assuming the client could use the A320 for the main Guangzhou to Sydney route and A319 for the new Guangzhou to Perth route. As we can see, the former route will remain profitable (8%) and the new route will give a 2.4% margin.\nInterviewer: So, what is your conclusion?\nCandidate: Taking into consideration that a 2.4% margin is not a very bad number for the airline industry and that our assumption does not take into consideration an additional demand generated by the new faster route from Guangzhou to Perth, the client should at least launch a trial of this new route. The former route, from Guangzhou to Sydney, will remain profitable.\nInterviwer: Very good. Thank you.\nNote:\nThis is a typical Bain style case. The interviewee should feel free to bring in their understanding of the airline industry as they see fit. This was a real case that the interviewer (a manager at Bain & Company) had worked on during his time at Bain. The interviewee should take some time to structure his/her thoughts before discussing the case.\nThe interviewer was expecting the interviewee to structure a framework, which would look at the big picture that any MBAs should have in mind about the airline industry. A strong candidate would have to arrive into final numbers as well as in a final conclusion.\nSome important elements are:\n\nFirst player in the market\nCannibalization and complementary business\nDiscuss trade-offs\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Headquartered in Parsippany, New Jersey, the company currently operates more than 6,800 franchised and company-owned locations throughout the US, including 2,800 located in Wal-Mart stores nationwide, and more than 400 Sears stores in the United States.\nAs a large tax preparer, the client makes the most part of their revenues between January and April tax season. They have been growing rapidly through franchise model for the last 15 to 20 years. The CEO of Jackson Hewitt Tax Service is concerned with the growth of the business in the recent years and wants us to investigate ways to stimulate growth through distribution footprint and same store sales.\nQuestion #1: What are the key areas to investigate?\nPossible Answer:\nA good answer will include the followings:\n\nRevenues: we need to investigate where the revenues are coming from; what type of products or services the client is offering\nCosts: what are the main buckets of costs and the value of them\nOperation mode: how do they operate the stores\nCompetition: operating model; market share\nCustomers: segments of customers and their needs\n\nNote: The interviewer or case giver should provide the following additional information to the interviewee. There is no need to wait for the interviewee to ask for the data; this “growth” case is about testing the candidate’s ability to handle a large amount of data.\n1. Operation mode: Franchising practices\n\n The client works by franchising territories. Currently there are 5,000 territories in US and the client Jackson Hewitt Tax Service is present in two thirds of them. The rest are considered not to be important.\n They have on average 2 stores per territory.\n Their current contract do not allow them to impose a minimum number of stores per territory to their franchisees.\n\n2. Revenues\nThe client’s revenues in this case come from two parts:\n\n $25,000 per territory franchise fee\n 15% of the store revenues\n\nThe client offers two types of products & services:\n\n Tax return preparation (state and federal tax)\n Refund anticipation loan (because government gives money back after 4-6 weeks)\n\nRevenues come from two different services:\n\n Tax return preparation: two thirds\n Refund anticipation loan: one third\n\nRevenues are 20% higher in the stores located in Wal-Mart supercenters\n3. Market & Competition\n\n The tax preparation market is very fragmented\n Client’s market share: 4%, No. #3 player in the market\n The number one competitor H&R Block has a triple market share vs. our client Jackson Hewitt\n Major competition liket H&R Block is operating on a corporate model (they own their stores)\n\n4. Customers\n\n The client’s number of current customers: 3.7 million\n 40% of every year’s customers do not come back the next year\n The customer of our client is having an annual income of about $30K – $35K\n The main competitor H&R Block’s customer is making $40K – $45K\n 60% of the US population (tax payers) is using tax preparation service, 40% do their own tax.\n\nQuestion #2: How can they increase their distribution footprint?\nPossible Solution:\n\nChange the franchising contracts as to impose a certain number of stores\nImplement a field sales force to cover part of the territories not in the vicinity of the current stores\nStart online operations\nStart opening stores in other mass merchandisers\nOpen stores in the other territories where not present\nBuy some of the competitors’ stores\nIncentivize franchisees to open more stores in their territories\n\nQuestion #3: How can they increase the same store sales?\nPossible Solution:\n\nStart selling packages of both services (Tax preparation & Refund anticipation loan)\nIncentivize customers to recommend the services to their friends, co-workers, etc.\nStart selling the services remotely\nTry to attract the other customer segment not currently present in our client’s stores\nTrain the franchisees on how to increase their business revenues\nAdvertise the services\nStart offering new services, e.g. tax school, tax education, selling tax software products\nInvestigate the causes of the lost customers every year and try to overcome the issue; offer an incentive to come back the next year\nImplement a field sales force attached to each store\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new product; operations strategy, supply chain optimization.\nConsulting Firm: Siemens Management Consulting first round summer internship job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: industrial equipment.\nCase Interview Question #00634: The client Cummins Inc. (NYSE: CMI) is a Fortune 500 corporation that designs, builds, distributes and services engines and related technologies. Headquartered in Columbus, Indiana, United States, Cummins sells in approximately 190 countries and territories through  a network of company owned and independent distributors and dealers. The company manufactures and markets a complete line of diesel and natural gas-powered engines for on-highway and off-highway use. Its markets include heavy and medium-duty truck, bus, recreational vehicle (RV), light-duty automotive and a number of industrial uses.\nRecently, Cummins has designed a new diesel engine with significant new technology and significant new content. It will meet all federal guidelines for at least 10 years. The client has spent significant research and development (R&D) money on this new engine and expects to be able to charge a premium price to recoup the investment. However, the client’s largest customer, representing 60% of all sales, has been complaining about the quality of the new diesel engine.\nOur preliminary research has shown that although our client Cummins promised their customers in terms of soot emissions less than 3,000 ppm, but they are currently seeing 20,000 ppm (1 ppm = 1 parts per million). What is wrong and what should the client do to rectify the situation?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate upon request)\n1. Product Design\nThe design process was unchanged for this new diesel engine. All testing was done the same as with historical products. However, the FMEA analysis (Failure, Modes, and Effects Analysis, used to identify and assess the ramifications of possible product defects) was skimped on. The significant new technological components of the diesel engine were developed according to the client’s standard process.\n2. Manufacturing\nCummins’ manufacturing plant uses a highly skilled and educated workforce. There is no learning curve associated with the assembly of this new product.\n3. Service\nThe client Cummins utilizes field technicians at the customer site. They are the ones reporting the warranty data to the client. They are all well educated on the product.\n4. Sub-assembly procurement\nTraditionally, the client Cummins used few suppliers who delivered large sub-assemblies. Now, in an effort to save costs, they have sourced many more suppliers to get the best price for each component and are choosing to do more of the assembly themselves. However, all of these suppliers are delivering products that meet the specifications delivered by engineering.\n5. Defect Details: See the chart below detailing the frequency of top warranty issues (Figure 1).\n\n6. Customers\nCustomers are concerned mostly regarding the quality of emissions.\nPossible Answer:\nInterviewer: So, how would you go about this case?\nCandidate: OK, so in order to identify the problem we need to assess all the stages that the new product is going through from the design to the moment it is ready to be sold to the customers.\nWe first need to understand what is changed in the design vs. the last model and if the new design is meeting the customer requirements.\nThen we need to look at the manufacturing process in terms of technology used, labor, if there is something that was needed to be changed and was not.\nWe also need to investigate the parts supply for the product and understand if anything changed in regards to the components that we are using for the new engine.\nLast but not least I would like to see the main symptoms that customers claimed and compare them with the previous engine.\nInterviewer: Great. (provide chart and additional information)\nCandidate: From the information provided it seems that there is nothing wrong with the new technology.\nInterviewer: All right, so where do you think the problem comes from?\nCandidate: I believe that one major change that the company made is in the base of suppliers, going from a limited number of suppliers to a bigger number of suppliers. Is the fact that they have more suppliers and are assembling the components in house a cause of the claims that we see in the warranty claim chart?\nInterviewer: Yes. You are right. Although each supplier is delivering to specification, there are tolerances in these specifications.\nSince the client is accustomed to specifying sub-assemblies, the tolerances were not tight enough for all of the individual components. Therefore, the stack-up of tolerances causes the parts to have poor fit resulting in leaks and lost parts.\nCandidate: OK. So the root cause for the problems is the stack-up of tolerances.\nNote: the interviewer needs to lead the candidate to identify this problem which is the stack-up of tolerances; all the other information given initially is a red herring meant to throw the interviewee off; after the interviewee has identified the problem, no matter how much help he/she gets, they need to come up with a list of recommendations and their risks on how to solve the problem.\nInterviewer: So, what do you recommend the client Cummins to do now?\nCandidate: The company can reduce its warranty claims by increasing tolerances on procured parts, increasing end product testing, or revising procurement agreement to order sub-assemblies.\nThe first opportunity is more expensive but we could look at ways to minimize costs. The second will increase manufacturing time but would definitely decrease our warranty claims. The third option is more expensive but we could perform a cost-benefit analysis between the 1st and the 3rd options.\nInterviewer: Great! Thank you for your analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: add capacity; investment.\nConsulting Firm: Boston Consulting Group (BCG) second round summer internship job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: mining & metals production; conglomerate.\nCase Interview Question #00637: Our client The 3M Company (NYSE: MMM), formerly known as the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, is a United States multinational conglomerate corporation based in Maplewood, Minnesota, United States. With over 84,000 employees, they produce more than 55,000 products, including adhesives, abrasives, laminates, passive fire protection, dental products, electronic materials, medical products, car care products, electronic circuits and optical films.\nThe 3M Company has operations in more than 60 countries globally, with major investments in South America, India and China. One of these investments is a mining operation in Brazil. At this mining operation, our client 3M produces only one kind of steel, an alloy made by combining iron and other elements such as carbon. Steel is considered to be an international commodity product and has hundreds of applications. In Brazil, there are only two other producers of this particular kind of steel. \nThe CEO of 3M has hired BCG to help identify new opportunities for this business as well as understand the market dynamics. He wants to know whether he should divest the mining business or invest in an additional facility. This afternoon, the BCG team is going to meet with the CEO to discuss our initial hypotheses. We have been provided the following information to assist us:\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate upfront)\n\n\n\nLocal Players\nPlant capacity (tons)\nCost/ton\nLocal sales\nExport sales\n\n\nClient 3M (A)\n600,000\n$450\n600,000\n-\n\n\nCompetitor B\n4,500,000\n$420\n2,800,000\n1,200,000\n\n\nCompetitor C\n3,200,000\n$420\n2,000,000\n700,000\n\n\n\n\nThe world-wide production (supply) of this particular steel product is estimated to be 100,000,000 tons per year. Furthermore, it is known that demand for this steel product is greater than current supply. As a commodity, the international price (export price) is $450/ton and the local price is $600/ton.\nAn efficient plant should have a 1,000,000 ton capacity (but, not all plants are operating efficiently). However, from this information the interviewee should be able to assume that therefore competitors B and C are operating more than one plant each.\nMarket grows with GDP.\nThere is a strong demand for this steel product internationally.\nThe competitors are probably located away from the coast, adding transportation costs.\n\nRecommended Approach:\nThis is a typical BCG style case. BCG often\n\n uses real life cases,\n presents available data upfront in a table during the case interview, and\n drives the interview to be a conversation between the interviewer and the interviewee.\n\nTherefore, be sure to engage the interviewer as you approach the case.\nThe interviewer was expecting the interviewee to first provide a structure/framework, which would look at the big picture and then start hypothesizing. A strong candidate would:\n\n Discuss market dynamics (local and international and supply/demand).\n Discuss the expected competitive response to any action, e.g., a price war.\n Summarize all findings in a presentation format.\n\nPossible Solution:\nInterviewer: So, how would you go about this case?\nCandidate: (Summarize the case and work on a framework) In this case it is important to look at the competition (specifically, understand the different cost structure of the 3 producers A, B, C), estimate the market demand and discuss the international trade environment. We should also discuss the specifics of a metal commercialization.\nInterviewer: OK. Where should we start?\nCandidate: Clearly, our client is running on full capacity, but its competitors appear to have some idle capacity. Furthermore, I note from the data provided that the competitors’ cost structures allow them to sell in the international market while our client does not currently export any of the products. Our client would experience zero margin if it was to export since the international price is given at $450 which is equal to our client’s cost of production. Nevertheless, the local price is considerably higher than the international price, so the producers would rather sell as much as possible in the local market. Given this information, I would hypothesize that there is not enough demand in the local market.\nCompetitors would prefer to sell in the local market ($600/ton) instead of export ($450/ton)\nCompetitors are running with idle capacity, but we know that demand exceeds current supply\nInterviewer: That is correct. But what about the international market?\nCandidate: This is a good point. You did mention that there is a strong demand for this steel product worldwide. Now we have to find out why the competitors are not selling their full capacity. We can think of many possible reasons, such as geographical distance, transaction costs, transportation costs, export taxes, etc.\nInterviewer: They all make sense, but as we see competitors are able to export some metal, right?\nCandidate: Competitors might have operations abroad so it makes easier to export to their international facilities. Or they might produce part of their capacity close to harbors. Considering that the international price is much lower than the local one, I would expect some barriers for international trade.\nInterviewer: That is correct, Brazil does have some taxes for foreign products and producers struggle with transaction costs. Let’s look at the cost structure. Why do you think there is a difference in costs?\nCandidate: I could consider geographic location, technology, economies of scale, supply chain synergies, etc.\nInterviewer: You mentioned some important elements. Our client has only one location and the competitors have multiple plants, each in the countryside. Our client was the first player in this market, having built its facilities 10 years earlier than its competitors. The industry has realized that a plant must have a minimum of 1,000,000 ton capacity in order to be efficient.\nCandidate: But our client is still making a lot of money, right?\nInterviewer: Yes, enough to convince the CEO to invest in a new production facility. This would be a $400 million investment in year 0 for a capacity of 1,000,000 tons with a cost of $420/ton. How would you evaluate this investment if this new production would be traded in the international market? Would you recommend this investment?\nCandidate: Basically the margin will be $30/ton ($450 – $420) * 1,000,000 equal to $30 million per year. By using a 10% discount rate this investment will generate only $30 million / 10% = $300 million in total. The $400 million investment would not be worth it.\nInterviewer: That is true. So, are you going to advise the CEO of 3M not to make the investment?\nCandidate: I would advise him against it unless he is willing to engage in a price war.\nInterviewer: OK. What would be the minimum price he could go to turn this investment profitable?\nCandidate: We should be cautious because a lower price would impact the current profitability.\nThe current margin is ($600 – $450) * 600,000 = $90 million.\nFor instance, if we drop the price to $513/ton,\n\n we would be losing ($600 – $513) * 600,000 = $52.2 million from the current 600,000 ton production,\n but generating ($513 – $420) * 1,000,000 = $93 million from the new production,\n or a net gain of $93 million – $52.2 million = $40.8 million.\n\nWith the 10% discount the minimum profit required from the new plant would be $400 million * 10% = $40 million. Therefore, the minimum price would be $513/ton.\nInterviewer: But if you drop the price to $513/ton, what would the competitors’ reaction be? Would they also increase production? Remember, they have idle capacity and you don’t.\nCandidate: That is correct, but the competitor has a lot more to lose with a price reduction. In our client’s case we found out that it would lose money as the margin of the current production drops. However, the client only sells 600,000 tons right now while the competitors sell 4,800,000 tons combined. They would probably reduce their production to avoid a higher price reduction.\nInterviewer: Really? So you are recommending our client to invest $800 million in a 2,000,000 tons capacity plant?\nCandidate: I haven’t done the math but I guess this would be too risky. I would recommend our client to invest the $400 million and see how the market reacts.\nInterviewer: That is a fair recommendation; after all they will be playing a game with no real expected result. Great, can you summarize your findings for the client?\nThe candidate should now summarize the findings from this discussion for the client, highlighting the approach and key recommendations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: private equity, investment; market sizing.\nConsulting Firm: Analysis Group first round summer internship job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: startups.\nCase Interview Question #00635: The client Austin Ventures (AV) is a private equity firm focused on venture capital and growth equity investments in business services and supply chain, financial services, new media, Internet, and information services companies. Based in Austin, Texas and founded in 1984, AV has raised approximately $3.9 billion since inception across ten private equity funds.\nRecently, the CEO and co-founder of a start-up has asked Austin Ventures to invest in his company. The start-up, based in Houston, Texas, makes high-end dish plate sets for the Mexican market. The CEO has mentioned that he is going to use the investment from Austin Ventures to purchase a new manufacturing machine that he expects will allow him to double production. Should AV invest in his venture?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate if requested)\n\n114 million people live in Mexico. Assume 100 million for the sake of simplicity.\nMexico population growth can be approximated to be 1% per annum.\nIncome distribution: 5% of population top, 45% middle class, 50% bottom.\n\nRecommended approach:\nRather than jumping directly to analyze in depth the market, the competition and/or the start-up company’s capabilities, it is recommended that you use a dialogue to seek out more information. When mentioning the themes you would like to cover, explain your reasoning behind each one.\nPossible Solution:\nInterviewer: So, should the client Austin Ventures invest or not?\nCandidate: OK, I would like to analyze three key areas that I expect will help me understand whether this is a good opportunity or not. I believe it is important to first analyze the market, focusing on its size, growth potential and trends in terms of product design, then understand who are the startup company’s key competitors and finally understand what this company can leverage from its existing operations once the new machine is in place.\nInterviewer: Good idea. Let’s focus on the market for a moment. How would you go about sizing it?\nCandidate: There are a number of ways to do so. We can do some market research and talk to your potential partner to get some information. Alternatively, we can visit some of the store or chains that sell that kind of product to build a market size from the bottoms up. Finally, we can estimate that number based on the population, etc.\nInterviewer: OK, let’s do the estimation based on the population. In Mexico there are 100 million people. What else do you need?\nCandidate: Do you have the income distribution pyramid of Mexico? I believe that income will play a role because households with higher incomes may purchase higherend dishes or may purchase different quantities than households at the other end of the income distribution. I would also like to get a sense of the replacement rate, if not given I can estimate. And, whether there are any key substitutes that I can expect in the market in the next few years, to ensure that my estimates are fair.\nInterviewer: Assume income distribution is 5% of population top, 45% middle class and 50% at the bottom. And, you can assume a 15% per year replacement rate.\nCandidate: OK. Let me quickly use these numbers to analyze the size of the market. I will calculate first “the stock”, which is the size of the market given by the replacement of dishes. Then I will calculate “the flow”, which is the size of the new market.\n\n\n\nItem\nQuantity\n\n\nPopulation\n100 million\n\n\n# of people per household\n4\n\n\nHouseholds\n100 million / 4 = 25 million\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome\n# of households\n# of different Sets\nTotal # of sets\nTotal # of sets (replaced)\n\n\nHigh\n25 million * 5% = 1.25 million\n3\n3,750,000\n3,750,000 * 15% = 562,500\n\n\nMedium\n25 million * 45% = 11.25 million\n2\n22,500,000\n22,500,000 * 15% = 3,375,000\n\n\nLow\n25 million * 50% = 12.5 million\n1\n12,500,000\n12,500,000 * 15% = 1,875,000\n\n\n\nInterviewer: But, are you sure that we can address the whole market?\nCandidate: No, in fact this was only to calculate the full market size. I still wanted to ask you which part of the market this startup company targets, is it within one income class?\nInterviewer: OK, they target the medium segment, which by your calculations is of about 3.4 million sets per year, among medium income households.\nCandidate: Great. However, I would still want to understand the projected market growth. If the population growth at 1% per year we can assume that there are about 250,000 (25 millions * 1%) new houses per year, which 45% are of medium segment and they have to equip themselves with 2 sets. So there is an extra 225,000 more dish sets demanded per year and a replacement rate of 15% on these new dishes. So, the market size is approximately 3,375,000 + 225,000 = 3.6 millions sets per year.\nInterviewer: On the ballpark, my estimation was that it was around 4 million.\nCandidate: Anyway, we are still missing other segments on the markets such as restaurants, hotels, offices, etc.\nInterviewer: (interrupts) Don’t worry about that. Let’s continue with this.\nCandidate: OK, so now, we have to think whether it is convenient for the client to invest. To do so I would like to do a break-even analysis of buying the machine and figure out the amount of sets that we have to sell.\n[The interviewer interrupts again, since time is running low. Remember to practice good time management in interviews and take clues from the interviewer]\nInterviewer: Assume that we have already done so and we figure out that the start-up company will have to produce at full capacity (150,000 sets per year). We don’t have much time. What would your recommendation be?\nCandidate: So, given that the startup was asking for the money to double production it means that their production will go from 150,000 to 300,000. As this estimate represents less than 10% of the available market (3.6 million), his proposal at first glance seems feasible.\nHowever, I would want to know the company’s current market share versus those of competitors in this segment. If a competitor already had 70% of the market, I might be more cautious about entering into this venture. Furthermore, if I had more time I would focus on what can be leverage from the current cost structure to assure it is a profitable proposition.\nInterviewer: Good. Let’s stop here for now.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Cisco designs, manufactures, and sells telecommunications infrastructure and networking equipment. The company’s current portfolio of products and services is focused upon three market segments – Enterprise and Service Provider, Small Business and the Home.\nThe management of Cisco have hired us to help determine if they have any excess manufacturing capacity.

How would you go about this case?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate if requested)\nThe interviewer does not offer the necessary data and so the interviewee should ask directed questions to extract the following data.\nThe client Cisco Systems currently has plants in both Minnesota and Mexico, close to the Texas border. The plants manufacture similar products and the facilities are about the same size. The company expanded capacity by replicating their first plant (using it as a template for others).\n\nEach plant operates an 8am – 5pm shift \nIndustry wide demand is flat or declining\nThe client Cisco has a relatively high market share of 80%\nCustomers are mostly phone companies and there are very high switching costs\nOur client recently acquired a competitor and there are very few players in the market right now.\nThe client is not highly concerned about new entrants because the industry growth is flat or declining, this is not an attractive market.\n\nPossible Solution:\nThe candidate should formulate a logical structure (internal vs. external factors, supply/demand, etc.) and then determine if the client has excess capacity or not.\nCandidate: I would start by looking into the company’s manufacturing process to determine if they are experiencing low utilization rates compared to the overall capacity of production.\nInterviewer: The company operates an 8am – 5pm shift and is running at fairly close to 100% utilization rate. However, they have considered shifting to multiple shifts in each plant and running a 22-hour workday. What do you think the overall demand capacity looks like in this particular industry?\nCandidate: I would assume that it is either flat or declining because the US telecommunication market is relatively saturated, with little new customer growth.\nInterviewer: Yes, that’s correct.\nCandidate: Ok, well, I would now like to investigate the overall market and determine where our client sits in the industry. Do we have any information about their market share?\nInterviewer: They have a relatively high market share of 80%.\nCandidate: Who are they supplying the products to? Consumers, business customers, or phone companies?\nInterviewer: They are a telecommunication infrastructure manufacturer, so their direct clients are the phone companies.\nCandidate: Does our client have any reason to believe that the market share could change dramatically? What are the switching costs in this industry?\nInterviewer: There are very high switching costs in the industry. Also, our client recently acquired a competitor so they are not anticipating any big declines in market share. There are also only a few competitors in the industry with little threat of new entrants due to the flat or declining growth.\nCandidate: Given the overall macro trends in this industry as well as their specific manufacturing set-up, I believe that our client does have excess capacity?\nInterviewer: Why?\nCandidate: Well, the industry is declining and there is less demand for these products over time. Also, opportunities exist to streamline their manufacturing operations with more shifts per plant across less overall plants.\nInterviewer: OK. What should they do?\nCandidate: They could close some existing plants, or they could generate revenues from manufacturing products for competitors (or for companies with similar products).\nInterviewer: Good. Looking at the first option, how would you determine which plants to close?\nCandidate: I would look at the overall cost per unit at each plant and determine which would result in the most efficient overall location. Costs could be classified into major subsets such as labor, distribution (from Mexico vs. Minnesota). I would also want to know if quality of product differs across any of the plants. Finally, it would be valuable to analyze whether our client could change their plant size and configuration to generate further efficiencies.\nInterviewer: Good. Quality is fairly consistent across all of the plants and they are not looking into plant reconfiguration at this point. Labor costs are the most significant contribution to cost per unit. Given that, what do you recommend?\nCandidate: I recommend our client closes the Minnesota plants and increases overall utilization of the plants in Mexico by adding shifts.\nInterviewer: What are the major risks/concerns of this recommendation?\nCandidate:\n\nNegative PR resulting from closing US plants\nScalability issues, e.g. can the Mexican plants quickly increase capacity?\nQuality issues stemming from increased production\nReliance on one location/region for all manufacturing\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: business competition; improve profitability.\nConsulting Firm: Roland Berger Strategy Consultants first round summer internship job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: publishing, mass media & communications.\nCase Interview Question #00638: Our client The Hearst Corporation is an American mass media group based in the Hearst Tower, Manhattan in New York City, New York, United States. As a major media conglomerate, the company’s holdings now include a wide variety of media, with radio stations, magazines and newspapers throughout the US.\nHearst is one of the largest diversified communications companies in the world. Its major interests include 15 daily and 38 weekly newspapers, more than 300 magazines around the world, 29 television stations through Hearst Television Inc., as well as business publishing, Internet businesses, television production, newspaper features distribution and real estate.\nHearst Corporation has five major newspapers in five important metropolitan areas. Its oldest newspaper, Seattle Post-Intelligencer (popularly known as the Seattle P-I, the Post-Intelligencer, or simply the P-I), circulates in the Seattle, Washington metropolitan area. After 50 years of great profitability and steady market, early this year Seattle Post-Intelligencer saw a strong decrease in both market share and price.\nThe CEO of The Hearst Corporation has hired our consulting firm to help understand the new market dynamics and determine what strategy should be taken next. The CEO is also expecting us to provide advice on whether he should increase prices for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. How would you go about addressing this question?\nSuggested Approach:\nThis is a typical profitability and business competition case for which one single framework won’t be enough. The interviewer was expecting you to look at the big picture and then start thinking about the profitability issue – both cost and revenue – and asking for specific information. A strong candidate would have to arrive at the following set of conclusions:\n\nThe new competitor targets a total different market from our client; this signals that there is an additional market that our client could consider exploring.\nThe new sales price is below the cost per paper; however, our client should look at the potential for advertising revenues. These should subsidize the uncovered cost of each paper.\n\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate if requested)\n\nMarket Share: for over 50 years The Seattle Post-Intelligencer newspaper had split the market (50-50) with a strong, but independent local newspaper The Seattle Times. The two are well recognized for their news quality.\nEarlier this year, another newspaper entered the market, building a 50% market share in less than nine months and leaving the two former newspapers (The Seattle Post-Intelligencer, The Seattle Times) with 25% market share each.\nAlthough the two major newspapers had dropped their prices to match the new entrant’s, this has not been enough to recapture the loss in market share. The new competitor is recognized as providing lower quality news than the former two players.\nNewspapers generate revenues from sales of papers as well as from advertisements.\nThere is a high fixed cost to operating a newspaper, which might be classified as sunk cost.\nCurrently none of the players offer subscriptions.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore\n\n\nAfter\n\n\n\n\nClient\nOld Competitor\nClient\nOld Competitor\nNew Competitor\n\n\nPrice\n$1\n$1\n$0.50\n$0.50\n$0.50\n\n\nDaily Sales Volume (units)\n2,000\n2,000\n2,500\n2,500\n5,000\n\n\nMarket Share\n50%\n50%\n25%\n25%\n50%\n\n\nDaily Ads ($)\n$2,000\n$2,000\n$2,000\n$2,000\n$0\n\n\nPages/day\n40\n40\n40\n40\n20\n\n\nCost/page ($)\n$0.01\n$0.01\n$0.01\n$0.01\n$0.01\n\n\nDelivery Cost (% of price)\n40%\n40%\n40%\n40%\n40%\n\n\n\nPossible Solution:\nInterviewer: So, how would you go about this case?\nCandidate: I’d like to understand a few things first in order to evaluate this market, especially what, if anything, has changed from last year.\n\n To this end, first I’d like to explore the current market demand for newspapers in Seattle.\n Then, I’d like to understand the competitive landscape.\n Third, I’d like to discuss any changes to our client’s management or internal processes.\n Finally, since we’re dealing with a profitability issue here, I’d like to explore both the revenue and the cost side of the business.\n\nInterviewer: That was a long list of things. Where should we start?\nCandidate: You said that there had been a decline in our client’s market share, so let’s take a look at the competitive landscape. How has the market share of its competitors changed?\nInterviewer: For over 50 years The Seattle Post-Intelligencer has split the market with a strong but independent local newspaper called The Seattle Times. The two are well recognized by their news quality.\nCandidate: Do they still split the market?\nInterviewer: Early this year, another newspaper entered the market, capturing 50% of the market in less than nine months and leaving the two former newspapers with 25% market share each. Why do you think that this happened, what factors are at play?\nCandidate: The new competitor must be offering either a better product or a lower price point. What do we know about the sales volumes and prices?\nInterviewer: These are the numbers. What do you think?\n\n\n\n\nBefore\n\n\nAfter\n\n\n\n\nClient\nOld Competitor\nClient\nOld Competitor\nNew Competitor\n\n\nPrice\n$1\n$1\n$0.50\n$0.50\n$0.50\n\n\nDaily Sales Volume (units)\n2,000\n2,000\n2,500\n2,500\n5,000\n\n\n\nCandidate: Interesting, actually our client The Seattle Post-Intelligencer and the former competitor The Seattle Times have increased sales volume with the entrance of a new competitor. I would imagine the new competitor is offering a different product or targeting a different market niche.\nInterviewer: That is correct. Although our client The Seattle Post-Intelligencer has dropped its price to match the new entrant’s – and the other major competitor The Seattle Times is always following it – this has not been enough to recapture the loss in market share. The new entrant is recognized for offering a lower quality newspaper. So, how would you explain that?\n(The Candidate should have noted the change in price and identified that this may be why there has been an increase in demand)\nCandidate: Well, there are some reasons that I can think of that might explain this phenomenon:\n\nAfter the two major newspapers dropped their prices to match the lower price of the new entrant, some of their readers could afford purchasing the two papers.\nAlternatively, potential newspaper readers who could not afford the $1 newspaper can now purchase newspapers at 50 cents.\nThe new competitor captured a new market niche, one that demands lower quality news.\n\nSales revenue was 2,000 * $1 = $2,000, but now it is 2,500 * $0.5 = $1,250. This represents only 1,250 / 2,000 = 62.5% of previous sales, or a 37.5% decline in newspaper sales. I don’t think that a newspaper would have such a high profit margin as to cover this decline, let’s look at Profits = Revenue – Cost. To do this I need to understand the per newspaper costs.\nInterviewer: OK, here is the data we have.\n\n\n\n\nBefore\n\n\nAfter\n\n\n\n\nClient\nOld Competitor\nClient\nOld Competitor\nNew Competitor\n\n\nPages/day\n40\n40\n40\n40\n20\n\n\nCost/page ($)\n$0.01\n$0.01\n$0.01\n$0.01\n$0.01\n\n\nDelivery Cost* (% of price)\n40%\n40%\n40%\n40%\n40%\n\n\n\n* There is a cartel for distribution\nCandidate: So after the new competitor entered the market, our client has $0.01 * 40 + 40% * $0.50 = $0.60/paper in costs, which is greater than the sales price of 50 cents. The new competitor, on the other hand, has 20 * $0.01 + 40% * $0.50 = $0.40/paper in costs, with a $0.10 margin over the variable cost per newspaper. Are there any fixed costs we should be considering or are these considered to be sunk costs? I would expect some heavy costs in this side.\nInterviewer: Yes there are, but they are sunk. However, I can tell you that our client The Seattle Post-Intelligencer is still making a profit, despite the numbers that you just calculated. How would you explain that?\nCandidate: Besides newspaper sales, I would expect that a newspaper generates revenues from advertisements and online. We should also consider the balance between subscribers and newsstand sales. Do you have any information?\nInterviewer: Yes and no. Actually neither our client nor its two competitors offer subscriptions. They do not have online news either. Let me give you the daily ad revenues. Any thoughts?\n\n\n\n\nBefore\n\n\nAfter\n\n\n\n\nClient\nOld Competitor\nClient\nOld Competitor\nNew Competitor\n\n\nDaily Ads ($)\n$2,000\n$2,000\n$2,000\n$2,000\n$0\n\n\n\nCandidate: Clearly the new competitor has not impacted the two former players’ advertisement revenue. It has also not been able to generate any revenue with ads. How come? I also would want to consider that with the expanded customer base, why there has not been also an increase in advertising, since I would imagine advertisers pay per reader.\nInterviewer: Usually companies split their budget of ads among the different means of communication that reach out to their target customers. So?\nCandidate: We can conclude that the new competitor has created a new market segment.\nInterviewer: That is correct. So, let’s say you will have a meeting with the CEO in five minutes, what would you recommend him to do? What will be your strategy?\nCandidate: I will tell him that he should raise the price of the newspaer, perhaps back to $1. Some reasons are:\n\nThe new competitor is not a direct competitor; it has created a new market niche of people who cannot afford to pay $1 and reads a totally different kind/quality of news.\nA price of $0.50 is not feasible in the long run for any of the players due to the high fixed cost.\nAs our client already mitigates the high fixed cost, the CEO should think about creating a new product (newspaper) focused on this new market niche. The new product should be totally independent and oriented to this market. In the worst case scenario they would make money out of printing (5,000 * $0.10) but could certainly convince its advertisers to direct part of their budgets to the new product.\n\nInterviewer: Excellent! I think you did a great job. Thank you.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: pricing & valuation; economics & finance.\nConsulting Firm: Schlumberger Business Consulting (SBC) 1st round job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: containers; freight delivery, shipping services; oil, gas & petroleum industry.\nCase Interview Questions #00410: Your client is the wealthy investor Warren Buffett, Chairman and CEO of Omaha, Nebraska-based multinational conglomerate holding company Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A, BRK.B). Buffett has inherited an oil tanker from a distant relative. He would like to sell the oil tanker, but knowing nothing of the oil transportation business, he needs a better understanding of what it is worth. How would you help him value the oil tanker?\nAdditional Information: (to be provided to candidate if asked)\nThere are 3 sizes of oil tankers in the market: Large, Medium, and Small. Ships are otherwise identical. The number of ships in the 3 categories as well as their capacity and cost are listed in the table below.\n\n\nSize\nSmall\nMedium\nLarge\n\n\nCapacity\n50,000 bbl\n100,000 bbl\n200,000 bbl\n\n\nCost (of one trip)\n$50,000\n$75,000\n$100,000\n\n\nNumber\n35\n15\n10\n\n\nYour client Warren Buffett’s ship is medium-sized.\nDemand in the oil tanker industry is flat, at 3,000,000 Barrel (bbl) per year.\nAssume that ships last forever (no depreciation). A used ship costs exactly the same as a new one.\nEach ship is independently owned and operated. Each ship is capable of exactly one trip per year.\nPossible Solution:\n\nThe interviewer told me (the interviewee) that discounted cash flow (DCF) tends to be the only method MBAs use in valuation cases. Therefore, it is important to first point out that you have thought broadly about the question before launching into the numbers: “There are 3 or 4 different ways to value the ship. One would be to discount the expected future cash flows. Another would be to attach an established industry multiple to sales or earnings. Another would be to use comparable deals, e.g. cargo ships in another industry, to establish such a multiple. Another would be to take the price of a new tanker and depreciate it to the proper degree. Depending on what we find, one method may be more useful than the others.”\nThe key is to recognize that this is an industry with excess capacity. An annual demand of 3,000,000 bbl supports all 10 large ships, 10 of the 15 medium ships, and none of the 35 small ships. Market clearing price will be set at $0.75 per barrel, the marginal cost of the medium ship. That makes yearly profits for the client’s medium ship = $75,000 – $75,000 = 0. In that case, the client’s oil tanker is worth nothing.\nHow can the client fix this? If a medium ship is truly worth $0 (or at least close to $0), the best move would be to buy out the excess capacity: i.e. buy 5 more medium ships. In this scenario, the client could scrap the extra five ships, and having removed excess capacity could raise prices to ~ $0.99 per barrel, or any amount less than the $1.00 per barrel offered by the small ships.\nSo, what’s the client’s ship worth now? It would make yearly profits of $99,000 – $75,000 = $24,000. Assuming stable demand (which is the case here), this cash flow could be discounted as a perpetuity, assuming a reasonable interest rate (say 5%). In that case the value could be estimated at $24,000 / 5% = $480,000.\nInterviewee’s Comments:\nThis pricing & valuation case is less about deriving a numerical answer than it is about showing that you can think broadly about the interplay between market conditions and value.\nThe candidate should recognize the cyclical nature of the oil & gas industry. CAPACITY is the central issue to consider. The client’s purchase of excess capacity is essentially a call option on the industry, a bet that demand will remain constant or perhaps increase. Also, the candidate should know the risks and rewards of this strategy.\nIn a commodity market where there is excess capacity and where competitors have varying marginal cost (MC), the market clearing price will likely be set at MC of the middle cost competitor, such that capacity matches demand as closely as possible. Removing excess capacity raises the market clearing price (assuming demand is constant).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, Bank of America is a multinational banking and financial services corporation, and is the second largest bank holding company in the United States by assets, and the fourth largest bank in the U.S. by market capitalization as of 2011.\nThe GC&SBB is the largest division in the company, and deals primarily with consumer banking and credit card issuance. Recently, the division head of Bank of America’s credit card business is considering launching a new cash-back reward credit card called “BankAmericard Cash Rewards”. The goal is to significantly grow their credit card business. You have been hired to advise them on rolling out this new product.\nQuestion #1: Is this new cash-back reward credit card a good idea?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to you only if asked)\nBank of America credit card business has two main revenue sources: merchant fee and interest earned on customer’s unpaid balance.\n\n The bank receives 1% of the transactions from merchants.\n The credit card has an interest rate of 12.99% APR (Annual Percentage Rate).\n There is no annual fee for the credit card.\n\nCash back Rewards\n\nCustomers earn a fixed percentage for different categories of purchase charged to the credit card.\nDetailed cash-back percentage of the reward program is shown in Figure 1.\nThere is no expiration on earned cash back rewards.\n\nAverage customer is expected to carry a balance of $1,000 on the card and have transactions worth $5,000 a year.\nAverage customer spending break-down is shown in Figure 2.\nPossible Answer:\nThis “new product” type of case is a simple math problem in which the candidate will have to evaluate the cost and benefit of the cash-back reward credit card. The calculation is best performed on an individual account basis.\nCost: cash back paid per year\n$5000 * 25% * 5% + $5000 * 15% * 3% + $5000 * 60% * 1% = $115\nBenefit: merchant fee and interest earned per year\n$5000 * 1% + $1000 * 12.99% = $180\nSo, it looks like the new cash-back reward credit card will be a profitable product, if there is no other cost involved.\nQuestion #2: Bank of America currently has 5 million regular credit card accounts with no cash-back rewards. For these accounts, customers carry a balance of $800 on the card and make transactions worth $4,000 a year on average. Should Bank of America allow the regular credit card to be converted to the new cash-back card?\nPossible Answer:\nFor the regular credit card, Bank of America earns merchant fee and interest, but does not pay any cash back. Net revenue = $4000 * 1% + $800 * 12.99% = $144.\nFrom Question #1, we already determined the net revenue for a cash-back credit card = $180 – $115 = $65.\nTherefore, they should not allow regular account to be converted to cash-back account.\nQuestion #3: Six months after Bank of America rolls out the cash-back reward credit card, they haven’t seen the expected growth in terms of the number of new account opened. The marketing department comes up with a promotion idea: For the first 50,000 new cash-back reward credit card accounts, customers can get a $100 cash back bonus after they make $500 in purchase within 90 days of account opening. How many new credit card accounts does Bank of America need in order to break even?\nPossible Answer:\nAssume that all the 50,000 new card members will be able to make $500 in purchase within 90 days and earn the $100 bonus.\nTo break even, set revenues – costs = $65 * X – 50,000 * $100 = 0, solve the equation X = 77,000.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Estimate the Numbers You Need and Check Them\nWhen estimating numbers, there are always at least three methods to consider:\n\nEstimations based on simple facts (e.g., the stadium probably holds 50,000 fans and is 95 percent full).\nDirect gathering of the data (e.g., contacting the stadium to ask the average attendance).\nEmpirical ways to test, either exhaustively or through sampling (e.g., posting counters at points of entry/exit).\n\nPossible Solution:\nFirst, we need to know how many people are at the game. The candidate should consider the fact that this is a Saturday game against the New York Mets and that it’s the seventh inning stretch. Several methods may be used to derive this number:\n\nCall the stadium, Major League Baseball or the Chicago Cubs organization for attendance on Saturday games and also perhaps games against the Mets.\nEither estimate what percentage of the attendance remains after the seventh inning stretch and/or ask stadium officials if they can help to provide this number.\n\nSecond, we need to know how many one dollar bills are in peoples pockets’ and/or personal carrying units.\n\nEstimate: How many one dollar bills do people carry on average?\nEmpirical Tests: Hire someone to sample people and ask how many one dollar bills they are carrying (how would you obtain a representative sample?).\n\nThird, we need to know how many one dollar bills are in cash registers in the various concession stands. How many concession stands? How many registers per concession stands? How many one dollar bills per register?\n\nEstimate: Estimate the number of concession stands and registers per concession stand (Should they be segmented into large and small concession stands?)\nDirect gathering: Call stadium for the number of concessions stands. Call concessions stands for number of registers.\nEmpirical tests: Sample the concession stands requesting how many one dollar bills they have at the end of the seventh inning stretch.\n\nSimilar techniques can be used to determine the other categories.\n\nNote: This case is very similar to the “How Many Pennies Are in a Shopping Mall” case. You may want to check out the solution to that case too.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: add capacity, growth; operations strategy.\nConsulting Firm: Mars & Co full-time first round job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: government & public sector.\nCase Interview Question #00616: Your client is the current Mayor of the City of Baltimore, Ms. Stephanie Rawlings-Blake. Baltimore is the largest city in the U.S. state of Maryland and the 24th largest city in the country. It is located in the central area of the state along the tidal portion of the Patapsco River, an arm of the Chesapeake Bay. The City of Baltimore has a population of 600,000 as of 2012. Over the past several years, the city has experienced a population decline which has negatively impacted the economy. In year 2000, the city population was 650,000.\nWhen the mayor ran for re-election her political platform was based on economic growth, so the recent population decline is an issue that is of great concern for her. The mayor has hired your consulting firm Mars & Co to understand what she can do to revitalize Baltimore. How can you help her?\nSuggested Approach:\nThere’s no real framework to use here for this operations strategy case. The key is to be structured throughout, to prioritize your thoughts, and to be sure to be able to understand the interdependencies of the population growth and the city’s unemployment rate.\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate if requested)\n\nPopulation of Baltimore (2012): 600,000\nCurrent unemployment rate: 8%\nThe mayor’s goal is to increase population growth by 5%\nCompanies in Baltimore employ 500 people on average\n\nPossible Solution:\nInterviewer: First question is, in general what could have caused a declining population?\nCandidate: Well, the most obvious reason would be jobs or employment. But, it could also be quality of life issues directly related to city services, like crime, schools, roads, and so forth. It could also be quality of life issues related to other issues, like culture. Finally, it could be cost of living issues for the residents.\nInterviewer: Great. Let’s say the mayor has done some preliminary research and the major reason people are leaving is because of lack of employment opportunities. What reasons can you think of for why companies are not hiring in Baltimore or even leaving Baltimore?\nCandidate: I think one reason would be financial. Perhaps the tax rates in Baltimore are too high, or property costs are too high, or labor costs are too high. Another reason would be around talent. It might be that the companies can’t find the kind of skilled labor pool they need. A third reason could be around location – it could be that as commerce changes Baltimore is no longer in a convenient location for companies to conduct their business.\nInterviewer: OK, so how can the mayor drive business growth and create opportunities to increase population?\nCandidate: Well, first, let’s approach the business growth. The mayor could identify what all the problems are that companies have and define strategies to address them.\n\n For example, if companies are leaving Baltimore because of financial issues then the mayor can consider lowering the tax rate or give tax incentives or offer property tax benefits. She can also perhaps offer labor subsidies to entice companies to come back to Baltimore.\n If the reason is around talent, then the mayor can implement a training program to give the labor pool the skills needed to be attractive to potential employers.\n If location is an issue for companies, the mayor can consider implementing a transportation subsidy or offer transportation services to help them conduct their business.\n\nOn the second issue of creating opportunities for population growth, I would think about it in terms of cost of living and quality of life.\n\n On the cost of living side, the mayor can consider reducing tax rates, property tax rates, and other issues that make the cost of living more expensive in Baltimore.\n On the quality of life side, the mayor can address issues like transportation (making it easier to get around), improving the environment, creating more outdoor recreation spaces, creating more cultural attractions.\nAlso, the mayor can also create a promotional campaign to attract more people to the city.\n\nInterviewer: Shifting gears, how many employers would the mayor need to attract in order to increase the city population growth by 5% and decrease unemployment rate by 3%?\nCandidate: Well, the current population is 600,000. What is the current unemployment rate and how many employees does one company employ?\nInterviewer: On average one company employs 500 people and the current unemployment rate is 8%.\nCandidate: And the unemployment rate affects only people who can be employed?\nInterviewer: Yes, that’s correct.\nCandidate: So the current population is 600,000 and assuming the average life span is 80 years, we can segment the population like this: 0-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-80. I’ll make the assumption that the working age population is from 20-60. Assuming an even distribution then we have 300,000 of employable people.\nInterviewer: That sounds reasonable.\nCandidate: OK, so currently the unemployment rate is 8% which means that there are 300,000 * 8% = 24,000 unemployed people, and 300,000 * 92% = 276,000 people are employed.\nWe want to reduce the unemployment rate to 5%. Assume that the population growth is evenly distributed across all age segments, then the new population of employable people would be (1 + 5%) * the current employable population of 300,000 = 300,000 * (1 + 5%) = 315,000 people. Therefore, the number of people that are employed under the new unemployment rate of 5% would be: 315,000 * 95% = 299,250 = ~300,000\nSo, the mayor would have to help create jobs for 300,000 – 276,000 = 24,000 people.\nYou mentioned that each company employs 500 people on average, so 24,000/500 = 48. The city will need to attract 48 new companies to accommodate the 3% decrease in unemployment rate and 5% increase in population.\nInterviewer: Good. So what can the mayor do to attract businesses to the city?\nCandidate: The mayor can consider lowering the tax rate or give tax incentives or offer property tax benefits. She can also perhaps offer labor subsidies to entice companies to come back to Baltimore. If the reason is around talent, then the mayor can implement a training program to give the labor pool the skills needed to be attractive to potential employers. If location is an issue for companies, the mayor can consider implementing a transportation subsidy or offer transportation services to help them conduct their business.\nInterviewer: Let’s say that I am the mayor and you have to summarize your recommendation for me, what would you say?\nCandidate: (Summarize the case and give the recommendation)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: operations strategy.\nConsulting Firm: Mars & Co second round summer internship interview.\nIndustry Coverage: Food & Beverages.\nCase Interview Question #00615: Richmond Foods is the leading ice cream manufacturer in the United Kingdom. Headquartered at Leeming Bar, North Yorkshire, England, the company controls more than a third of the UK’s take home ice cream market. It supplies ice cream to many of the UK’s leading supermarkets, grocery stores, and restaurants.\nIn May 2006, Richmond Foods announced that it was to be taken over by Oaktree Investments, an American Investment Company, who will unite Roncadin, the biggest German own-brand label ice cream manufacturer, and Richmond, to make the largest ice cream manufacturer in Europe. The new company is now known as R&R Ice Cream.\nNow R&R Ice Cream is the European market leader with a share of 31% of the overall ice cream market. The client, the CEO of R&R Ice Cream, is concerned because its ice cream sales are more seasonal than those of competitors, even though overall profits are excellent. How would you help the CEO to reduce sales seasonality?\nSuggested Approach:\nA good possible framework is to look at the 3C’s: Company, Customer, Competitors\n\nCompany\n\n Product mix: characteristics, seasonality, how perishable it is, etc.\n Operations: is the manufacturing capacity used continuously or seasonally throughout the year? can we use the capacity to produce less seasonal products than ice creams?\n\n\n\nCustomer\n\n Segments, trends, characteristics in terms of seasonality\n\n\nCompetitors\n\n How do they differ from the client with regards to the two previous points: Company and Customer\n\n\n\nIt is important that the candidate recognizes that there are two ways to reduce seasonality here:\n\n Modify the seasonality of sales themselves\n Modify the production or the products to come to a less seasonal use of capacity.\n\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate if requested)\n1. Products\n\n Ice creams, sorbets\n Very perishable products (by nature and regulation)\n Very extensive to store\n\n2. Operations\n\n The client’s pduction follows seasonal sales pattern (too expensive to store)\n The production line could be used to produce other types of items.\n 90% of the production costs are fixed.\n\n3. Customers: 3 main types of customers\n\n Ice cream stores: highly seasonal\n Retail / supermarkets: moderately seasonal\n Restaurants: almost not seasonal\n\n4. Market situation\n\n\n\nChannel\nOverall market split\nClient’s market share on this channel\nContribution to its overall market share\n\n\nRetail / Supermarket\n40%\n40%\n16%\n\n\nRestaurants\n30%\n10%\n3%\n\n\nIce cream stores\n30%\n40%\n12%\n\n\nTotal\n100%\n\n31%\n\n\n\nPossible Solution:\nInterviewer: How would you go about approaching this problem?\nCandidate: (The candidate should come up with a framework. See the 3C’s framework in the “Suggested Approach” section above.)\nInterviewer: Good points. Where do you want to start?\nCandidate: Let’s talk about the operations first. The demand for ice cream is by nature seasonal. Does the client currently produce ice cream continuously or seasonally throughout the year?\nInterviewer: There are peaks in production to match demand. Why do you ask?\nCandidate: Considering that 90% of the current costs are fixed, it might be less expensive to smooth production over the year. The capacity would not need to be as high since there would not be peaks anymore, therefore the fixed costs would be reduced. However, this would involve storage of ice cream during the months of low demand.\nInterviewer: This is an interesting thought. However, our ice cream is too perishable to be stored for more than 2 weeks.\nCandidate: Maybe we could modify our products by adding preservatives and stabilizers.\nInterviewer: Not a bad idea. However, regulations prevent us from doing this.\nCandidate: OK. It seems that production of our ice cream will remain seasonal then. To maximize the use of capacity and reduce our fixed costs burden, could the plants be used to manufacture other types of products during non-peaks periods?\nInterviewer: This would be a possibility, but we have not explored it in details. What else would you need to know?\nCandidate: We discussed the possibility to reduce the seasonality of operations. Now, I would like to talk about reducing the seasonality of sales. Who are our current customers?\nInterviewer: Who do you think they might be?\nCandidate: As a customer, I can buy ice cream at supermarkets, ice cream stores/chains, and restaurants. Do we sell to all of these channels?\nInterviewer: Yes, they are all our customers. Which do you think has the most seasonal demand?\nCandidate: Ice cream stores would definitely be the most seasonal. Supermarkets would be less seasonal because people still eat ice cream at home during winter watching TV, even though they buy less than during summer. Finally, I would say that restaurants are the least seasonal because they always have ice creams on their menu and add it with apple pies, chocolate tarts, etc. Does it seem reasonable?\nInterviewer: Yes, it makes sense.\nCandidate: How do we split our sales to these channels? And how does it compare to our competitors?\nInterviewer: Let me give you the following data. We miss some client information here. Could you please calculate what’s left for me?\n\n\n\nChannel\nOverall market split\nClient’s market share on this channel\nContribution to its overall market share\n\n\nRetail / Supermarket\n40%\n40%\n16%\n\n\nRestaurants\n30%\n?\n?\n\n\nIce cream stores\n30%\n40%\n12%\n\n\n\nCandidate: You mentioned initially that the total market share of the client is 31%. Since retail/supermarket and ice cream stores contribute to 16% and 12%, restaurants must contribute to the rest (31% – 16% – 12% = 3%). Therefore, the client’s market share on restaurants channel must be 10% (3% / 30% = 10%)\nInterviewer: Good. Based on everything we discussed, what would you recommend the client do to address its seasonality concern?\nCandidate: Firstly, I would recommend targeting more strongly the restaurants, as their demand is less seasonal and the client is relatively weakly positioned there compared to competitors. Secondly, I would recommend looking at products we could manufacture in the current plants during non-peak times of the year, so as to optimize the use of the fixed cost capacities.\nInterviewer: Great. Thank you.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: human capital, HR, organizational behavior; merger and acquisition (M&A).\nConsulting Firm: Monitor Group second round job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: healthcare: hospital & medical.\nCase Interview Question #00614: Synthes Holding AG (formerly Synthes Stratec, SIX: SYST) is a multinational medical device company based in Solothurn, Switzerland. It is the world’s largest maker of implants to mend bone fractures, and also produces surgical power tools and advanced biomaterials. The company’s shares are listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange and the firm is a constituent of the Swiss Market Index (SMI), Switzerland’s blue-chip stock market index.\nDePuy is a franchise of orthopaedic and neurosurgery companies. Acquired by American medical devices and pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) in 1998, its companies form part of the Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices & Diagnostics group. DePuy develops and markets products under the Codman, DePuy Mitek, DePuy Orthopaedics and DePuy Spine brands.\nOn April 27, 2011, DePuy and Synthes agreed to a merger deal. The merger will create the world’s largest orthopedic corporation DePuy Synthes. A combined DePuy-Synthes unit could potentially be worth USD $46 billion. For this case, they need your assistance on the human capital side to make sure that the merger is successful. How would you go about this case? What are some of the issues you would focus on?\nSuggested Approach:\nCase structure is really important here in this “Human Capital/Organizational Behavior” and “Merger & Acquisition” case. Make sure the candidate touch on all points highlighted below and explain why each point is important. \n\nProject Plan\nLeadership Alignment\nOrganization Re-design\nTalent retention\nCommunication\nCulture\nSynergies\n\nPossible Solution:\nInterviewer: So, what are the elements that we should focus on?\nCandidate: Well, I think we should look at the following elements:\n\nProject Plan\nLeadership Alignment\nOrganization Re-design\nTalent retention\nCommunication\nCulture\nSynergies\n\nInterviewer: Great. Let’s go through each item individually. What are the elements of a project plan?\nCandidate: The project plan would have\n\n a list of prioritized business needs,\n ideas on how those actions would be completed,\n set timelines and milestones.\n\nInterviewer : Good. Now, let’s turn to leadership alignment. Why is it important to align the leadership?\nCandidate: A successful merger cannot depend on momentum coming just from the very top. It has to come from many levels in the organization. To ensure this we need to work with the leadership to identify key stake holders.\nInterviewer : How would you go about aligning the leadership?\nCandidate: We will\n\nHave merger teams on either side who are working on the integration, this should include key influencers and stakeholders\nGet buy-in from key influencers and stakeholders throughout the organization\nInclude these teams in our plans and incorporate their inputs, get their perspective into the project plan. This will give them a sense of ownership, and help in keeping the momentum going leading to a successful integration\nBe clear to these teams that\n\n The merger is going to happen\n identify what are the ways the merger is going to affect them\n what are the conflicts they may face\n what kind of resources do then need\n what are the critical things that they are working on that might affect the merger.\n\n\n\nInterviewer: Good. Now what about organizational re-design?\nCandidate: There is an overall business strategy that’s driving the change in the first place. We need to create an effective organization that matches the broad business strategy so that the business objectives can be achieved.\n\nThe main incentive here is to create a new organization or re-organize so that it is aligned with the business strategy that is driving the change in the first place\nIdentify the requirements of the new organization and compare it to the inventory of existing capabilities\nTake inputs from all levels to do this\nIdentify the talent base that we have available, their competency and find the top performers\nIf there are gaps, recruit from outside if necessary\n\nInterviewer: Good. Now, let’s look at the challenges. Why is talent management important?\nCandidate: There is an insecure environment. Talented people are highly marketable. Don’t give them a chance to consider leaving. Convince them that they will be valued in the new organization.\nInterviewer: How could we do that?\nCandidate: Look look at 2 aspects – one is talent retention during the transition period and other is talent management for the new entity.\nTransition\n\n When there is change/merger/re-organization, there’s always uncertainty\n The most talented people are the ones most likely to leave for other, more secure places\n To prevent this you should reach out early to them and make sure that you explain the change to them\n Work with HR to implement retention strategies focused on your top employees.\n\nPost-Merger Talent Management\n\n Common performance management systems – what metrics to evaluate, how do you do annual reviews, is there mid term reviews, etc.\n Harmonize compensation plans, benefit plans, pension plans\n Create global talent management programs – how do you reward high performers, mentoring programs, rotation, etc.\n\nInterviewer: Good. Now, what can you tell me about communication?\nCandidate: Communication is key to ensure morale and productivity remain high. There are 2 different types of communication: internal communication and external communication.\nInternal Communication\n\n Times of transition create all sorts of rumors through the organization\n These rumors can worsen the problem of talent retention and cultural clash\n Best way to tackle this is to communicate early and communicate often\n Keep communicating the progress of the reorganization, the reason for it, the final objective and how the transition is coming along\n If necessary, repeat the same message over and over even if there is nothing new to report\n And make room for 2-way communication so top leadership is aware of the rumors and emotions floating around at the lower levels and can address them squarely\n Remember that any empty communication space will be occupied by rumor and speculation, so don’t allow it.\n\nExternal Communication\n\n Present unified face to the external world\n Keep our business partners, our customers, our suppliers apprised of the developments\n Have press conferences\n Press releases\n Interviews\n Public event sponsorship\n\nInterviewer: Good. Now, what can you tell me about the culture?\nCandidate: Culture is deep rooted and there is no way to change them quickly. It’s something that happens over time.\n\nCulture is the most difficult challenge to manage – it’s usually very deep-rooted and intangible, so don’t try to change it overnight\nFocus on areas where cultural fit is most important, such as the areas in which the two merged entities directly communicate\nIn these areas, try and build a new culture by creating a new brand or identity for the merged entity\nHighlight the importance of cultural issues to business value so that you get buyin from management.\n\nInterviewer: Great. Now what can you tell me about cost synergies?\nCandidate: There may be cost synergies that we need to look into which may involve lay-offs which could be another challenge that the organization will face.\nNote: The candidate should not insist that we need to cut people, etc. Remember, this is a human capital case and not cost reduction. He/she must be sensitive to the issue.\nInterviewer: Good. What other decisions are there to make?\nCandidate: I would also think of the following:\n\nWhich companies processes to adopt\nBuild a shared services platform\nEnterprise wide HR system\nNew IT system\nHarmonize compensation plans, benefit plans, pension plans\nCreate global talent management programs\n\nInterviewer: Very good. I think you have done a wonderful job. Do you have any questions for me?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: private equity, investment.\nConsulting Firm: Arthur D. Little first round summer internship job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: airlines; startups.\nCase Interview Question #00617: Our client Apax Partners is a global private equity and venture capital firm headquartered in London, United Kingdom. The firm, including its various predecessors, have raised approximately USD $35 billion dating back to 1969. As of 2012, Apax had invested in more than 360 companies in all stages of development, representing a broad range of industries.\nRecently, Apax Partners is looking at investing in a start-up low cost airline carrier focused on the route from New York City to London. Specifically the start-up airlines company is looking to play on JetBlue (NASDAQ: JBLU)’s presence at John F. Kennedy (JFK) International Airport and EasyJet (LSE: EZJ)’s presence in London Stansted Airport. Currently there are only large players in this market, no low cost carriers for that route. The question is, should Apax Partners invest in the start-up airlines company?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate if requested)\n1. Numbers of flights between NYC and London\n\n Currently there are 40 flights between New York City and London every day\n On average there are about 300 seats per flight\n NYC-London flights are 90% full\n\n2. Market segmentation\n\n 70% of passengers are price sensitive.\n\n3. Costs to the airline per ticket (this is the same for the entire airlines market)\n\n Planes – $180\n Fuel – $180\n Labor – $60\n Other – $60\n\nCompetitor ticket price – $450\n4. The start-up airlines company is in negotiations to procure a plane and has already negotiated space in terminals in both JFK and Stansted.\nPossible Answer:\nInterviewer: How would you go about answering this case question?\nInterviewee: To answer this question I would look at several factors. First I would look at the potential for revenue. I would try to size the market and understand if there is a sizable enough market for a new player, and I would examine the price of competitors to understand if given the current market size what level of revenue can we expect. Next, I would look at the costs of this endeavor and determine whether at ths revenue level this business is profitable.\nInterviewer: Good, let’s start with sizing the market. How would you go about this?\nInterviewee: I would look at all current flights between New York City and London and look at the breakdown of business versus economy class tickets sold.\nInterviewer: How many flights do you think fly between New York and London per day?\nInterviewee: Well, there are about four US carriers and another two or three British carriers flying between NYC and London. And I would guess that they each fly about seven or eight flights per day. So, somewhere between 42 and 56.\nInterviewer: Well, that’s close. Let’s say that there are about 40 flights per day.\nInterviewee: Then I would look at the number of seats per airplane and the percentage of those seats that are full.\nInterviewer: Good, let’s say that on average a plane can carry 300 people and is 90% full.\nInterviewee: So, if there are 40 flights with 300 people per flight and 90% full, we have a market of 40 * 300 * 90% = 10,800, or about 11,000.\nInterviewer: Good, now as you mentioned earlier, what percentage of passengers do you think are price sensitive vs. not price sensitive?\nInterviewee: I would guess that the majority of passengers are price sensitive, so I would say around 70/30.\nInterviewer: OK, so what is your total potential market?\nInterviewee: Well, we are looking at 70% of 11,000, or 7,700 per day.\nInterviewer: Good, now let’s move to the costs side. What costs would need to be considered?\nInterviewee: There are many costs such as airplanes, fuel, terminal space within JFK and Stansted as well as labor including everything from pilots to administrative staff, marketing and then various other costs such as food and/or amenities aboard the planes.\nInterviewer: Let’s say that their costs are as follows (calculated on a per flight ticket basis): airplane costs $180, fuel costs $180, labor costs $60, and all other costs are $60.\nInterviewee: Thus the total cost per ticket to this airline = $180 + $180 + $60 + $60 or $480. Do we know what the current airlines charge for their tickets?\nInterviewer: Yes, they charge $450 per ticket.\nInterviewee: And do we know what their costs look like?\nInterviewer: You can assume that the $480 per ticket is the same for the entire airlines market’s costs per ticket.\nInterviewee: So the competitors are selling their tickets at a loss?\nInterviewer: That is correct, what might be some reasons for this?\nInterviewee: The competitors are all large airlines, they probably have a very diversified system of routes and can thus afford to lose money on their route from New York to London if they make is up on shorter routes. They may also have a large disparity in the rates they charge both using business class as well as last minute or peak time reservations to make up for their losses on other routes.\nInterviewer: So, if this start-up carrier could reduce their costs to $350, would you recommend that they enter the market?\nInterviewee: Well, if they enter the market and undercut the major players, their competitors would simply reduce their rates and it would become a price war. And, since their competitors are more diversified and have established brand, they will probably fare better under such circumstances.\nInterviewer: OK, what would you tell our client Apax Partners?\nInterviewee: Well, especially since our client is a private equity firm and is looking to get in and get out of projects within a few years, I would recommend against investing in this start-up company. The returns are small if any, and with such high start up costs it is a very risky venture.\nInterviewer: Good. Thank you.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: estimate, guesstimate.\nConsulting Firm: Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) first round full-time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: small business.\nCase Interview Question #00618: It’s noon, a professional thief in downtown Manhattan has to decide which one of the three stores is the most convenient (meaning profitable) for him to rob: a bakery, a flower shop, or a luxury chandelier store. Assume that the thief won’t be caught, which store should he choose?  What factors should he consider in making the decision?\nSuggested Approach:\nEssentially this is an estimation or guesstimate case. The interviewee should immediately focus on estimating cash-on-hand and sales per day because the robber cannot re-sell goods. The thief should determine which shop has more cash, which is probably the one with more sales and less use of credit cards and checks. Good candidates should be able to solve this case with two different methods:\n\n Estimate daily sales number from average price of goods sold and estimated daily sales volume\n Estimate daily sales number from monthly net income and estimated profit margin of each shop\n\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate if requested)\nThe most important factors are as follow:\n1. Cash delivery:\n\n All three shops deliver their cash to the bank every night.\n There are no differences in the alarm systems for the three shops. This case is about cash flow and not about thieving techniques.\n\n2. Forms of payment:\n\n Bakery customers only pay with cash and don’t use credit card\n Flower shop customers pay using either credit card or cash\n Chandelier buyers pay only using credit card or check\n\n3. The three stores are all family owned:\n\n The three families have the same life style, and probably have the same net incomes from their business.\n\nPossible Answer:\nInterviewer: So, if you were this thief, what would you do?\nCandidate: Honestly, I have never thought about this problem. Can I take a second to understand they key aspects of the case?\nInterviewer: Sure, take your time. The police are not around.\nCandidate: Can the robber resell the items he steals?\nInterviewer: No.\nCandidate: Then, I think the thief should robber the shop with more cash on hand.\nInterviewer: That is probably true, how would you estimate the cash on hand for each shop?\nCandidate: The cash comes from the customers of the shop who paid cash and not using credit card or check.\nInterviewer: OK, so what would you do?\nCandidate: I want first to analyze the sales for each store and then I will estimate the percentage of customers paying cash for each store.\nInterviewer: That sounds like a good starting point.\nCandidate: Sales are volume * price. Do we have any information about the number of customers for the three stores? What about the average prices?\nInterviewer: Actually we know this:\n\n\n\nShop\nTraffic\nPrice\n\n\nChandelier store\n4 customers per day\n$500 average price\n\n\nFlower shop\n32 customers per day\n$15 – $25 average price\n\n\nBakery\n2 assistants, 10 customers per hour per assistant, store opens at 6am\n$2 per item\n\n\n\nCandidate: Perfect. Let’s calculate the number of customers for each shop. Assuming that the stores have been open for half day so far (because it’s noon), and that the distribution of customers is uniform during the day, we can say that:\n\nChandeliers store: 2 customer\nFlower shop: 16 customers\nBakery: 10 customers/hour/assistant * 6 hours * 2 assistants = 120 customers\n\nWith these assumptions we can finally calculate revenues:\n\n\n\nShop\nTraffic\nPrice\nRevenues\n\n\nChandelier store\n2 customers\n$500 average price\n$500 * 2 = $1000\n\n\nFlower shop\n16 customers\n$15 – $25 average price\n$20 * 16 = $320\n\n\nBakery\n120 customers\n$2 per item\n$2 * 120 = $240\n\n\n\nInterviewer: That sounds reasonable. So should he rob the luxury chandelier store?\nCandidate: Most likely not. The chandelier store sells expensive products and probably 100% of the customers don’t pay with cash. I would exclude the chandelier store also because there is too much risk that with only 2 expected customer nothing has been sold so far.\nInterviewer: What about the other two stores?\nCandidate: I assume that all the bakery customers pay by cash since it is only $2 per item. Some of the flower store customers pay by cash and the remaining would likely use debit or credit card. Is that correct?\nInterviewer: Yes, that is correct. What percentage of customers of the florist should use cash so that it would be more convenient to robber the florist?\nCandidate: Since the bakery has $240 and the flower shop has $320, we need at least $240 / $320 = 75% of the florist customers paying by cash.\nInterviewer: Do you think this is possible?\nCandidate: No, I would rather think that the percentage is 50%-50%. If I were the thief I will visit the bakery.\nInterviewer: Very good. I want you to analyze the same problem from a different perspective. Let’s assume that the thief knows neither the number of customers in the shops nor the average prices. How could he estimate the cash on hand of each store?\nCandidate: What information does the thief have? Does he know the income of the owners of the store?\nInterviewer: Let’s assume that all the three stores are family owned. The three families have the same life style and most presumably have the same net income from the stores. Where should the thief go?\nCandidate: Since the three families have the same income, we can assume that the bakery has more sales.\nInterviewer: Why?\nCandidate: Because profit margins are much lower for bakery stores than for luxury chandeliers stores and flower stores.\nIf we assume that all three family earns, for example, $5,000 per month net income and that profit margins are:\n\n\n\nShop\nIncome/month\nProfit Margins\nSales/month\n\n\nChandelier store\n$5,000\n50%\n$5,000 / 50% = $10,000\n\n\nFlower shop\n$5,000\n20%\n$5,000 / 20% = $25,000\n\n\nBakery\n$5,000\n5%\n$5,000 / 5% = $100,000\n\n\n\nSince the thief cares more about day sales and cash-on-hand, under these assumptions, I would still visit the bakery.\nInterviewer: Very good. Thank you for your analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: estimate, guesstimate.\nConsulting Firm: Katzenbach Partners (now Booz & Company) first round job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: government & public sector.\nCase Interview Question #00609: Houston is the fourth largest city in the United States (after New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago), and the largest city in the state of Texas. Houston is the seat of Harris County and the economic center of the Houston–Sugar Land–Baytown metropolitan area, the fifth largest metropolitan area in  the U.S. with over 6 million people.\nOur client is the Houston Police Department (HPD), the primary law enforcement agency serving the City of Houston, Texas and some surrounding areas. According to the HPD’s website, the mission of the Houston Police Department is to enhance the quality of life in the City of Houston by working cooperatively with the public and within the framework of the U.S. Constitution to enforce the laws, preserve the peace, reduce fear and provide for a safe environment.\nThe Houston Police Department has hired Katzenbach Partners to determine how many Police Officers they will need next year. How would you go about estimating that number?\nSuggested Approach:\nThis estimation case should be structured in four parts, each focused on one question. The interviewer should start giving out the first question and should pass on to the second question only after the candidate has finished addressing the first question. For questions 1, 2 and 4, the interviewer should request the ideas to be put in groups.\nThe fours steps of the case are as follow:\n\nWhat are the things you should analyze in order to help our client HPD estimate the number of police officers needed next year? Please organize your ideas in different groups\nWhere would you find the information to analyze the issues just mentioned? What sources of information would you search?\nQuantitative analysis\nWhat would you recommend the HPD do to improve its efficiency?\n\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate if requested)\nNote: Not to be given until the third question\n\nHouston City Population: 2 million in 2000, grew 20% between 2000 and 2007, expected to be 2.5 million in 2012\nCity Area: 4200 squared miles in 2000, 4400 squared miles in 2007 and expected to grow to 4480 squared miles by 2012\nOfficer per 100,000 inhabitants in Houston: 220 in 2000; 200 in 2007\nBenchmark officers per 100,000 inhabitants: 240 for the City of Los Angeles\n\nPossible Solution:\nInterviewer: So how would you start approaching the problem? What are the things you would analyze to determine how many officers the Houston Police Department will need?\nCandidate: OK, I will start by analyzing the area of the city and the population. I would also like to have more information on the current crime rate, the types of jobs the policemen are performing, the hours per week they work, holidays they have. In addition I would look at the quantity of Police Offices there are in the city, if there are any special occasions in which they need more resources.\nInterviewer: Those are great ideas. Could you put them in different groups so we are sure we don’t forget anything?\nCandidate: Sure, so I will have three groups:\n\nGeography and other statistical information\n\n Area of the city\n Population\n Crime rate\n Number of Police Offices\n\n\nLabor information\n\n Hours per week\n Days off\n Holidays\n Job types (such as administrative, traffic control, crime prevention, etc)\n\n\nOther specific information\n\n Special events planned\n Contingency events\n\n\n\nInterviewer: Good, is there any other thing you consider important in order to assess the number of police officers needed?\nCandidate: Yes, we should do some benchmark analysis with other cities similar to Houston. That will actually be another group of our analysis:\nBenchmark Analysis\n\n What is the crime rate in other cities like New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago?\n How many police officers do they have?\n What type of jobs do their police officers perform?\n How has the number of police officers evolved during the past years?\n How has the crime rate change during the past years?\n\nInterviewer: Excellent, I think we are ready to move on to another question: What sources of information would you consider in order to analyze the ideas you just mentioned? Please link each item with where you will find that information.\nCandidate: OK,\n1. Geography and other statistical information\n\n Area of the city: Local city government and HPD statistics\n Population: Local city government and PD statistics\n Crime rate: HPD statistics\n Number of Police Offices: HPD statistics\n\nAt the HPD I will ask the Administrative Chief or Chief of Police.\n2. Labor information\n\n Hours per week\n Days off\n Holidays\n Job types\n\nOur source will be the head of HR or Staffer of each department.\n3. Special events:\n\n Special events planned\n Contingency events\n\nAgain here we need to have inside information from someone with a High rank, Chief of Police for example\n4. Benchmark Analysis\nAll this information could be obtained from other Police Department at other cities like New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago. They should be collaborative as they are not competition.\nIn all cases we should conduct interviews with the people mentioned in order to obtain the information needed for our analysis. In addition we could interview some people living in the city to obtain their perception of the Houston Police Department and their perception of the city’s security.\nInterviewer: Ok, let’s move on. We actually were able to obtain some information that you wanted to analyze. In year 2000 the population of the city was 2 million inhabitants, in 2007 (seven years later) the population grew by 20% (total in the seven years) and it is expected to be 2,500,000 in year 2012. Area of the city was 4200 squared miles in 2000, 4400 in 2007 and is estimated to grow to 4080 squared miles by 2012. Finally, the number of Police Officers per 100,000 inhabitants were 220 in 2000 and 200 in 2007. What are your initial thoughts in these figures?\nCandidate: It is obvious that the number of officers per 100,000 inhabitants has grown less than the population of the city.\nInterviewer: Yes, can you calculate the number of officers?\nCandidate: Sure. (set up a data table to calculate the number of officers)\n\n\nYear\n 2000\n 2007\n 2012\n\n\nPopulation\n 2,000,000\n 2,400,000\n 2,500,000\n\n\nArea (squared miles) \n4,200 \n4,400 \n4,480\n\n\nOfficer per 100,000 inhabitants \n220 \n200 \n???\n\n\nNumber of Police Officers \n220 * 2,000,000 / 100,000 = 4,400 \n200 * 2,400,000 / 100,000 = 4,800 \n???\n\n\nInterviewer: Perfect, now, using the city of Los Angeles as a benchmark, they have 240 officers per 100,000 inhabitants right now. How many police officers in Houston would that ratio gives us?\nCandidate: 240 * 2,500,000 / 100,000 = 6,000\nInterviewer: Yes, what do you think of this number?\nCandidate: I think it is actually too high. From 2000 to 2007, we increased our force from 4,400 to 4,800, or about 9% in 7 years. If we needed 6,000 police officers in 2012, we would be increasing our force by 25% in only 5 years, when the population has been growing only 4% during the same time period.\nIn addition, maybe Los Angeles has added many officers in order to decrease their crime rate that was actually very high. Another reason could be that LA is a city with a large geographic area and people may be more spread out than in Houston.\nInterviewer: You are right, it is too much. What would your estimate be then?\nCandidate: I would use the ratio they had in 2000 (220 officers per 100,000 inhabitants). That will give me a total of 220 * 2,500,000 / 100,000 = 5,500 officers.\nInterviewer: OK, now let’s imagine the Houston Police Department doesn’t have the resources to increase the number of police officers it currently has. What ideas would you give the HPD in order to increase their efficiency and improve their service?\nCandidate: I would divide my ideas in three groups: Operations, Citizen work and Focus.\n\nOperations\n\n analyze procedures\n assess work load for each division\n rebuild teams if necessary\n\n\nCitizens work\n\n train and educate population in working with the police in making the city more secure\n organize seminars and workshops in the neighborhoods to assess needs\n\n\nFocus\n\n analyze crime rate in different neighborhood in order to focus and maximize resources\n assess city needs and focus resources in priority issues\n\n\n\nInterviewer: Any other idea?\nCandidate: Yes, they should also focus on training their staff in order to make them more efficient. Also, they should assess strengths and weaknesses of the officers for each job. Finally, they should analyze current technology and determine possible improvements in administrative issues that could be solved with investment in information technology (IT).\nInterviewer: Perfect, thank you!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new product.\nConsulting Firm: IMS Health Consulting Group first round job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: healthcare: pharmaceutical, biotech, life sciences.\nCase Interview Question #00611: Our client Glaxo Smith Kline plc (LSE: GSK, NYSE: GSK) is a multinational pharmaceutical, biotechnology and consumer healthcare company headquartered in London, United Kingdom (UK). It is the world’s fourth largest pharmaceutical company measured by 2009 prescription drug sales (after  Pfizer, Novartis, and Sanofi). GSK has a portfolio of products for major disease areas including asthma, cancer, virus control, infections, mental health, diabetes, and digestive conditions.\nGSK has an existing drug brand-named Requip that has been on the market for several years. Requip was first approved by the United States FDA (Food and Drug Administration) for treatment of Parkinson’s disease in 1997. Parkinson’s disease is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system. Early in the course of the disease, the most obvious symptoms are movement related; these include shaking, rigidity, slowness of movement and difficulty with walking and gait.\nOne of the side effects for Parkinson’s disease is RLS or Restless Legs Syndrome. This is a neurological disorder characterized by an irresistible urge to move one’s body to stop uncomfortable or odd sensations. It most commonly affects the legs, but can affect the arms, torso, and even phantom limbs. GSK’s existing drug Requip is often used to treat patients with RLS. The client GSK wants to understand whether it would be profitable to roll out a new drug specifically targeting RLS and has asked IMS Health Consulting Group to evaluate this idea. How would you go about this case?\nPossible Solution:\nInterviewer: So, how do you want to structure this case?\nCandidate: (I first structured my thoughts on paper. I divided the sheet of paper into two sections – the Costs and Benefits  of rolling out a new drug specifically targeting RLS)\n\nCosts:\n\n FDA approval process\n Manufacturing Costs\n Marketing Costs\n\n\nBenefits:\n\n Market Size\n Competition\n Our Market Share\n Pricing – Economic Value to Customer (EVC), Cost-Based Pricing, and Competitive Pricing\n\n\n\nInterviewer: What information do you want?.\nCandidate: Let’s start with the cost side. Do we have any information on that?\nInterviewer: Well, we know that the client GSK is already on phase 2 of the new drug trial. They have feedback on the new drug – it has great efficacy and very low side effects. They estimate that this new drug can be rolled out in one year. Other than this information, I do not have any cost numbers and costs are not important.\nCandidate: So, let’s look at the benefits. Do we know anything about competition?\nInterviewer: This is an emerging market with no official competition, though like our existing drug Requip, there are other general Parkinson’s disease drugs that are being used to treat RLS. In the Parkinson’s drug competitive spectrum, however, we are positioned in the following way\nMarket Share\n\n Client GSK – #1 in market share: 30%\n Company #2 in market share: 25%\n Companies #3 – #10 in market share: 45%\n\nCandidate: Given that we have existing competition, what about any emerging competition on the horizon?\nInterviewer: The client GSK is expecting new competition in year 2012/2013 and that this competition will have a new drug for RLS that has twice the efficacy of the client’s drug. Can you size up the U.S. market for this new RLS drug so we can better assess the benefits before delving further into the competition?\nCandidate: OK. The size of the US population is 300 million. Do we know what percentage of the population has RLS?\nInterviewer: 0.13%\nCandidate: Then, let’s say the total market is roughly 400,000 people. But how many people with RLS actually seek treatment?\nInterviewer: Only about 30% knew or sought treatment for RLS.\nCandidate: That leaves us with a market size of 120,000 people. Now let’s get a dollar amount for the market size. Do we already have an established price and dosage for the RLS medication?\nInterviewer: The RLS medication had to be taken twice a day and that each pill cost 5$.\nCandidate: Then the revenue per day is 120,000 * 10$ = $1,200,0000 per day.\nInterviewer: Can you calculate this annually?\nCandidate: Well, there are 365 days in a year.\nInterviewer: Stop. As with most medication, the patient does not take the medication every day of the year but would take it about half of the year, those days when they felt the symptoms were particularly strong.\nCandidate: Well, then it would be 150 days, so we get $1,200,0000 * 150 = $180 million annually.\nInterviewer: What about the marketing plan for this new RLS drug?\nCandidate: Well, let’s look at all of the participants of the supply chain and their interests:\nThe client GSK —> Health care provider —> Physician —> Pharmacist —> Patient\nThe client deals with manufacturing and marketing – their interest is profit.\nHealth Care Provider will determine whether the EVC (Economic Value to Customer) is substantial and the price low enough to authorize the physicians to prescribe the durg – their interest is low costs.\nPhysician will prescribe according to EVC – their interest is efficacy.\nPharmacist has no direct impact on the drug other than being the middle man.\nPatient, depending on whether informed or not, may or may not ask for the drug, they often trust the Physician with respect to efficacy, they usually listen to the Health Care Provider with respect to price.\nGiven those participants, the best marketing approach would be to target the Physician because the price at 5$ a dose, 2 times a day was already pretty low and would probably appease the Health Care Provider. Also, since this is the only FDA approved drug of its kind, the Physician could encourage the Health Care Provider to accept this on their list of approved drugs. Marketing approaches to reach the Physician could include:\n\nPublications\nFree Samples\nBundled Products (with the other Parkinson’s drug)\n\nInterviewer: How should we advise the client GSK to price the drug if they are questioning their 5$ a dose price?\nCandidate: We could take three approaches to pricing the drug\nCompetition based pricing – in this case as there is no direct competition, we would look at the prices of the substitutes for the client’s new drug – the Requip drugs that were currently used to treat RLS despite not being FDA approved for that use.\nEVC (Economic Value to Customer) based pricing – in this case the value of this drug to the customer is that it is designed specifically for RLS and therefore can be used more accurately to treat RLS than the other substitute drugs. I estimate the EVC price to be high given this background.\nCost based pricing – in other words how much does the drug cost to manufacture – plus the client may want to pad number to try and make back the R&D costs put into developing this drug.\nInterviewer: Good. Thanks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: increase sales.\nConsulting Firm: Capgemini Consulting second round summer internship interview.\nIndustry Coverage: tobacco & alcohol.\nCase Interview Question #00610: Our client Campari Group (Gruppo Campari, BIT: CPR) is a multinational producer of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages headquartered in Milan, Italy. As one of the multi-billion dollar liquor distributors, the Campari Group holds a portfolio of over 40 brands marketed and distributed in more than 190 countries. The group’s operations are split into three segments: spirits, wines and soft drinks. Total revenues were approximately €1.2 billion in year 2010.\nCampari Group is the sixth biggest player worldwide in the branded spirits category, operating principally in the U.S., Italy, Brazil, and in continental Europe. Recently, the CEO of Campari Group has hired you as a consultant to determine why its whiskey brand is not growing. How would you go about it? What recommendations would you give to the CEO in order to grow whiskey sales?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate if requested)\n1. Competition and Market Share\n\n\n\nMarket Segment\nHigh end\nMedium\nLow end\n\n\nGrowth this year\n14%\n-6%\n8%\n\n\nCompetitors\n10 in total, 5 new\n2 in total, including the client\n4 in total\n\n\n\nOur client Campari Group is in the medium segment.\n2. Customer segmentation and trends\nOur client Campari Group’s customers are as follows (give all this information at once):\n\n70% are male 40-55 years old\n\n They like taste and brand\n Usually they enjoy a drink after work\n They are into the tradition and brand\n They drink whisky straight or on the rocks\n\n\n30% are younger male or female 21-35 years old\n\n They are bar and club crowd\n They enjoy mixed drinks\n\n\n\n3. Product\n\nOur client the Campari Group has recently increased their whisky price from $22 to $24 a bottle.\nOther competitors in the medium range are priced at $22 a bottle on average.\nDistillers have changed the ingredients to save $0.50 per bottle on COGS (Cost of goods sold) but have not changed the taste.\n\nPossible Solution:\nThe key to this case is to understand the customer preferences are shifting away from the medium range into either the high end or the low end. The high end provides the 70% male segment with the refined taste and distinguished image and taste that they are attracted to. The low end provides the 30% “bar crowd” a cheap whisky to imbibe. The rise in price has driven many of the client’s customers away and the company needs to reconsider its pricing strategy and branding strategy.\nInterviewer: So, how would you approach this case?\nCandidate: Well, I’d start externally: What has happened with the competition and the customers? In terms of the competition, I would look at changes in market share, any new competition, the market segmentation, and market growth. Regarding segmentation, I would also look at the customers, what do they want? Finally, I would look internally and look at our product, marketing, and pricing.\nInterviewer: Great. Where do you want to start?\nCandidate: Well, what do we know about the market? How is it broken up?\nInterviewer: Well, there is a high end, medium range and low end of the market. The high end has 10 competitors, the medium end has 2 including the client Campari Group, and the low end has 4.\nCandidate: Okay, and how is each market growing?\nInterviewer: The high end market is growing at 14% a year, the low end is growing at 8%, and the medium range is contracting at 6%.\nCandidate: Well, I can see a problem already. We’re in a segment of the market that’s contracting. Has market share changed or have there been any new products introduced?\nInterviewer: No.\nCandidate: Then, let’s look at customers. What do we know about our whiskey drinkers?\nInterviewer: Our client basically has two types of whiskey drinkers:\n\n70% are male 40-55 years old\n\n They like taste and brand\n Usually they enjoy a drink after work\n They are into the tradition and brand\n They drink whiskey straight or on the rocks\n\n\n30% are younger male or female 21-35 years old\n\n They are bar and club crowd\n They enjoy mixed whiskey drinks\n\n\n\nCandidate: That’s interesting. We must be rather traditional brand if we have such an older following. Let’s turn internally. What do we know about our product? Have we changed price, marketing, or the product recently?\nInterviewer: Our marketing has been consistent. The distillers recently changed ingredients to save 0.50$ per bottle, but that hasn’t effected the taste. Also, we have recently raised the price from $22 to $24 a bottle.\nCandidate: That’s interesting. What is our competition priced at?\nInterviewer: The competition at the mid-range part of the market is at $22 per bottle on average.\nCandidate: Well, that’s interesting. Do we know if this price change affected the younger crowd?\nInterviewer: What do you think?\nCandidate: I would assume this would affect them because they drink our product mixed, and there’s probably little discernible difference to them. They probably have less brand loyalty as well.\nInterviewer: Good. Now what would you recommend to our client?\nCandidate: Well, it seems that we’ve learned a few things:\n\nYounger, bar crowd customers are more price sensitive\nBut 70% of our customers have great brand loyalty and would like migrate to the higher end market\nThe 30% bar crowd are moving to the lower end market because they drink whiskey mixed\n\nBased on the analysis, I would give the following recommendations:\n\nThe client should try to enter the higher end premium market to recapture their customers and grow market share\nThe client could also consider entering the low end market with a brand extension\n\nInterviewer: Great! Thank you.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: increase sales/revenue.\nConsulting Firm: Arthur D. Little first round job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: automotive, motor vehicles.\nCase Interview Question #00612: Our client Ducati Motor Holding S.p.A. is a leading Italian company that designs and manufactures motorcycles. Headquartered in Bologna, Italy, Ducati is owned by Audi (FWB: NSU) through its Italian subsidiary Lamborghini. The company produces high end luxury motorbikes which they sell globally. Ducati is best known for high performance motorcycles characterized by large capacity four-stroke, V-twin engines, featuring a desmodromic valve design.\nDucati Motor has 150 motorbike stores. 50 stores are single brand (they only sell Ducati brand motorcycles) and the remaining 100 stores are multi-brand (they sell between 3 and 8 different brands of motorbikes). Multi-brand stores have similar sales and income figures, while single brand stores are either huge success or on the verge of bankruptcy. A single brand Ducati store in Italy did so badly that the owner killed himself after bankruptcy.\nThe CEO of Ducati Motor hired Arthur D. Little because he wants to identify the major reasons of this diversity among single brand stores and find a way to decrease the number of under-performing single brand store. How would you go about helping him? What would you suggest to Ducati’s CEO?\nSuggested Approach:\nAn outstanding candidate will list all the major possible differences between single-brand and multi-brand store and then will ask questions in order to focus on the most important ones. After identifying the most important differences the candidate should suggest any reasonable recommendation to identify opportunities for single brand stores.\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate if requested)\nThe main factors are cross-selling and customer brand recognition.\nBrand recognition\n\n Ducati has not yet established customer loyalties in most of the countries where it sells.\n In US for example, there is not yet customer captivity for Ducati bikers (Ducatisti). A customer captivity is when a business has “captured” their customers. and the customers have high costs in switching to an alternative product or service provider, or simply because the customers have developed a strong “habit” in buying the product or service.\n\nCross-selling\n\n Ducati does not risk loosing a loyal customer when they shop at a multi-brand stores\n There are several loyal customers who discovered Ducati trough multi-brand store and then remained loyal\n The best single brand store can be found near competitor stores or in region where multi-brand stores are present, especially near multi-brand stores selling several brands (7 or 8 )\n\nPossible Solution:\nInterviewer: So, tell me how would you structure this problem?\nCandidate: Our client asked us to identify the main reasons for such a disparity between their single brand and multi-brand stores and give a suggestion once they found key issues. It is an interesting and complex case. May I take a second to structure a proper analysis?\nInterviewer: Sure.\nCandidate: OK, these are the aspects I want to analyze:\n\nGeography: Are under-performing single brand stores located in particular areas (urban/suburban) or particular countries (EU/USA/Asia)?\nCustomers: Did Ducati target the right customers in each area they are positioning a new single brand store?\nManagers: Is the Ducati relationship with single brand managers different from multi-brand store managers?\nStores: Is there any major difference between single brand and multi-brand stores in terms of client mix?\n\nInterviewer: The distribution of under-performing single brand stores is uniform among cities, suburban areas and different countries.\nDucati has a clear value proposition and the customers’ analysis is well structured. Ducati treat multi-brand and single brand store managers in the same way. Once a new store manager (either single brand or multi-brand) decides to open a new store, he or she asks Ducati to supply its motorbikes; Ducati decides to accept or not this new distributor considering strategic/location factors. No further consideration is made based on the nature of the store (multi-brand versus single brand).\nYour fourth point is the most important one. What do you think is the major difference between multi-brand stores and single brand stores? How do you imagine these two kinds of stores?\nCandidate: Let me think a little bit. I think that the major differences between multi-brand and single brand stores are:\n\nSize: single brand stores are smaller than multi-brand stores\nCustomers: single brand stores attract mostly Ducati enthusiast or curious customers, while multi-brand stores attract every kind of customers who are thinking about buying a new motorbike\nManagers and Operations: a single brand manager is most likely an enthusiast Ducati user but not necessary a good motorbike seller, while a multi-brand manager is most likely to be an experienced manager and motorbike seller\nTraffic: obviously multi-brand stores attract way more customers than single brand stores. Most likely, the more brands they sell the bigger is the traffic.\n\nInterviewer: Very good. These are main differences. We initially thought from ice creams, high-end motorbike sales are uncorrelated from store traffic. Evidence showed the opposite. Surprisingly, we have noticed that single brand store with higher traffic are most likely to perform better. Do you think you can analyze the possible reasons?\nCandidate: Yes. I think is probably a problem of brand recognition. Most likely potential loyal customers in some regions are not aware of the experience of riding a Ducati. Probably they have never seen one.\nInterviewer: That is possible. How would you identify one or more indicators to analyze single brand stores traffic without actually visit them?\nCandidate: I would look to the single brand stores located in area where enthusiasm for motorbikes is higher. I think that the best way is to look at competitors and multi-brand stores’ locations. May I ask whether or not there is any geographic correlation between the distribution of performing single brand stores and multi-brand stores? Are they in the same areas? Are top single brand stores located near competitors’?\nInterviewer: I think we are close to the solution of the problem. Yes, you are right. We have analyzed the distribution of the best single brand stores and they are located close to competitors’ or multi-brand stores. We have also noticed that the bigger the multi-brand store the higher is the performance of single brand store. What can you infer from that?\nCandidate: I think that cross-selling and traffic are the best way to increase brand recognition and eventually single brand store’s performances.\nInterviewer: That makes sense. So, what would you suggest to Ducati’s CEO?\nCandidate: I would suggest Ducati locates all the areas in which there is a major distribution of multi-brand stores and competitors stores. Ducati should invest in creating new single brand stores and showrooms in these areas so to leverage the brand recognition created by the multi-brand stores and increase sales.\nInterviewer: Very good. We appreciate your analysis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: human capital, organizational behavior.\nConsulting Firm: IMS Health Consulting Group second round full time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: healthcare: pharmaceutical, biotech, life sciences.\nCase Interview Question #00613: Our client Forest Laboratories Inc. (NYSE: FRX) is a large pharmaceutical company headquartered in New York City, United States. The company’s research and development (R & D) spending has grown rapidly in recent years, and as of 2011, approached a billion US dollars a year, which put Forest Laboratories on the list of the top 100 global corporations in R & D spending.\nOur direct contact person in this case is the Head of the R & D department of a Forest Laboratories. He wants us to advise him on how to improve the productivity in the R & D department. How would you go about analyzing the case? What recommendations would you give to the Head of R & D?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate if requested)\nThe following facts are to be disclosed during the course of the case.\n\nThere are basically several steps leading from the discovery of the molecule to the launch of a drug: Discovery -> Preclinical studies -> Phase 1 -> Phase 2 -> Phase 3 -> Approval & Launch\nIt normally takes about 10 years to discover a drug and get it approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\nThe drugs are usually patent protected for 15 – 20 years.\n\nPossible Solution:\nCandidate: I’m not so familiar with the drug discovery and the FDA approval process. Can you tell me a bit more?\nInterviewer: Sure. There are basically several steps leading from the discovery of the molecule to the launch of a drug. It normally takes about 10 years to discover a drug and get it approved by the United States FDA.\n\nDiscovery: discovery of the drug molecule\nPreclinical studies: researchers test the drug on Animals\nPhase 1 clinical trial: researchers test the drug in a small group of people (20-80) for the first time to evaluate its safety, determine a safe dosage range, and identify side effects.\nPhase 2 clinical trial: the drug is tested in a larger group of people (100-300) to see if it is effective and to further evaluate its safety\nPhase 3 clinical trial: the drug is given to large groups of people (1,000-3,000) to confirm its effectiveness, monitor side effects, compare it to commonly used treatments, and collect information that will allow it to be used safely.\nApproval & Launch\n\nSo, how would you measure the productivity of the R & D department?\nCandidate: I would look at the success of the R & D department in terms of the drugs discovered.\nInterviewer: If you had to measure the productivity in terms of a formula that you could present to the shareholders, what would that be?\nCandidate: The formula would look like this:\n(NPV of future cashflows of successful drugs – R&D cost of all drugs) / R&D cost of all drugs\nInterviewer: What are the big drivers to increase the productivity?\nCandidate: Let’s look at each aspect of the formula that we have written:\n1. NPV of future cashflows of successful drugs\nThe big drivers of the NPV of the future cashflows are as follows:\n\nQuality of the compound\n\n Quality of the drug compound is the most important factor that influences the cash flows. Say Lipitor (a drug used for lowering blood cholesterol) for instance – it’s the highest quality compound that’s out there in the market and its capturing record revenues year after year. It’s important to ensure that sufficient tests have been done during the test phase to ensure that there are no side effects to the drugs.\n\n\nLength of research\n\n As it takes around 10 years to discover a new drug, reducing the length of time taken will increase the patent time thus maximizing our return.\n\n\nMarketing & Sales promotion efforts\n\n While this aspect is beyond the hands of our client, it is an important element of the future cashflows. The sales and marketing team are responsible to build awareness and demand for the product.\n\n\n\n2. R & D cost of all drugs\nThe 2nd part of the formula is the cost of developing the drugs. It’s important to minimize the cost of research to have the maximum productivity. That can be done in the following manner:\n\nStrict controls and parameters at each stage of the research & development\n\n No drug which has a likelihood of failing the current stage should be passed to the next stage. This ensures that costs of failure are kept to the minimum. If the controls are not strict, then a lot more money would be spent on patient testing and the drugs end up getting rejected in the later stages. This not only wastes money but also valuable time which could have been spent on another drug.\n\n\nQuality scientists\n\n In order to control the costs of R & D and make it more productive, we need high quality scientists and researchers.\n\n\nAcquire compounds developed successfully up to certain stages\n\n Due to the length of time a complete in-house drug discovery takes, it might be worthwhile to explore outside and either acquire or obtain partnerships with other companies for promising drugs. This diversifies the risk as well as may yield a good return.\n\n\n\nInterviewer: Any other ways to increase productivity? What about the R & D organization?\nCandidate: We need to keep the scientists sufficiently motivated as it’s a very long process before their drug is successful. We need to ensure that they do not move organizations quickly leading to loss of critical talent.\nInterviewer: What is the biggest challenge that the R & D Head faces today?\nCandidate: The biggest challenge the R & D Head faces today is on evaluation of scientist teams. What kind of measurable metrics to set and how to evaluate the scientist against it.\nInterviewer: What is the biggest mistake that an R & D Head could make?\nCandidate: The biggest mistake an R & D Head could make is to measure the scientists based on the number of drugs they pass from one stage to the next. This will motivate them to pass certain drugs which maybe borderline or even not fit to be passed to the next stage. This increases the R & D costs significantly and as mentioned before wastes time that could have been spent on other products.\nTheir incentive structure should be based on compliance, how strictly they have adhered to the guidelines. Any product that fails at a later stage and where the cause can be directly attributed to a prior stage should impact their performance.\nInterviewer: Great! Now let’s summarize the case and make a recommendation to the client’s R & D Head.\nCandidate: We have seen the different stages of drug discovery and know that it takes about 10 years to discover a new drug. We have also looked at the drivers of productivity which are mainly the future cashflows from successful drugs and R & D investment in all drugs. In order to increase the productivity I would recommend that we take steps to\n\nShorten the length of research so that we get maximum patent protection time to maximize our returns.\nEstablish strict guidelines at each stage of the R & D process to ensure that failures are discovered more quickly.\nChange the incentive structure of the scientists so that the metrics for evaluating them is compliance driven and not based on the number of drugs passed to the next stage.\n\nInterviewer: Excellent! Thank you.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: add capacity.\nConsulting Firm: Capgemini Consulting second round job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: paper products.\nCase Interview Question #00605: The client Domtar Corporation (TSX: UFS, NYSE: UFS) is an integrated producer of uncoated freesheet paper. With its head office in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, its operations center is in Fort Mill, South Carolina, USA. The company designs, manufactures, markets and distributes a wide range of  business, commercial printing, publication as well as technical and specialty papers.\nRight now, Domtar Corporation is the second largest paper manufacturer in the US market, after International Paper Company (NYSE: IP). The management of Domtar believe that if they increase their production capacity by 50,000 tons a year, they can become the number 1 player in the market (their goal) in both revenue and volume. The client would like you to advise them whether or not they should increase capacity by 50,000 tons/year. What would you recommend?\nNote:\nThis “increasing capacity” case is about testing how well the candidate can engage the interviewer in intellectual discussion of key facts/strategic issues. The case assumes that the candidate has already made the second round and that the partner doing the interview is more interested in getting to know how the candidate thinks, builds relationships, and communicates than standard first round cases. So while a hard case solution would be nice, it is not necessary and not the focus of the case.\nSuggested Frameworks\nCost-Benefit Analysis. It helps if the candidate can articulate that the decision comes down to whether the benefits of increasing capacity by 50K tons a year outweigh the costs. It is pretty obvious, but it shows that the individual knows what the problem boils down to.\n\nPotential benefits\n\n incremental revenue\n increased number of customers: untapped population, steal from competitors, and/or expand the market\n better pricing\n better profit margins\n\n\nPotential costs\n\n capital investment\n marketing costs\n business development\n\n\n\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate if asked)\n1. Domtar Corporation’s Customers: newspapers like Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Washington Post, etc. Note to the interviewer: do not volunteer this information, as it is an important question the candidate should ask to understand what type of client Domtar is and what they do.\n2. Industry Demand for paper is completely flat, i.e. no growth or depletion expected.\n3. Paper can be considered a commodity, so Pricing is not a factor. In a commodity market, all competitors have the exact same price, equal quality, aren’t differentiated on service, value-added offerings, reliability, or anything else. Only price matters, and any movement by one company triggers a reaction from all competitors.\n4. Capital Investment to increase capacity\nThe interviewer should probe the candidate about what considerations might be:\n\n build entirely new plant vs. use existing facility?\n cost of new machinery vs. have available machinery\n incremental labor costs\n maybe per-unit production costs decline through economies of scale, thus increasing net margins?\n benefits it might offer to other divisions in the company?\n other?\n\nAfter discussion, the candidate can assume that the capital investment is costless for the sake of simplicity, i.e. the client Domtar has available machinery, factory space, labor, etc. to increase capacity by 50,000 tons. Obviously, though, this would be an important factor.\n5. Competitive Landscape\n\n\n\nCompany rank (by market share)\nCapacity (K tons)\nUnits Sold/Utilization (K tons)\nCost of production/ton ($ USD)\n\n\n1\n300\n300\n$22\n\n\n2 (client Domtar)\n250\n250\n$25\n\n\n3\n200\n200\n$20\n\n\n4\n150\n150\n$30\n\n\n5\n100\n100\n$45\n\n\n6\n50\n20\n$60\n\n\n\n(Note to the interviewer: the interviewer should prepare a separate slide with the above data for purposes of giving this case)\n\nThe total paper industry capacity is 1,050K tons and utilization is 1,020K tons\nUtilization rate for all players is 100%, except for #6 (only 40%)\nMarket clearing price is $60/ton (paper is a commodity, so price taker), so the candidate can quickly calculate margins if desired or just realize that #6 is only breaking even\nThe candidate can also calculate break-even quantity they would need to obtain or break-even cost of investment for project to have positive NPV (net present value)\n\nPossible Answer\nIf the client Domtar adds the 50K tons of capacity and pricing remains constant, there may not be any incremental business attained.\nReducing price significantly will destroy significant value in the market, e.g. if the client lowers their price to $60/ton, everyone will match and assuming per-unit cost.\nIf, after increasing capacity, the client lowers price to $59/ton, everyone else will also lower their price, while presumably company #6 will drop out of the market because they’d be operating at a loss.\n\nThe client would capture all their business (i.e. steal market share from #6), since everyone else is at capacity\nThis makes sense when you consider the micro-economic framework of supply and demand (inelastic demand, supply curve shifts out, price declines, see Figure 1 below)\nThat would then create 20K tons of capacity, i.e. additional revenue, but 30K tons are then still available\n\n\nBonus point would be for the candidate to inquire what else can be done with that available capacity:\n\nFor example, the client can manufacture gift wrapping paper with the same machine, so that might present a worthwhile opportunity\nThe client can also see if it is at all possible to increase market size\nMaybe consider non-US customers\nOther possibility?\n\nThen, ask the candidate how his/her answer might differ if capacity increase weren’t costless – The candidate would need to factor in additional costs vs. incremental revenues using discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis.\nIn summary, the candidate should articulate key assumptions about what the core essence of the problem, how the client should only undertake project if profitable (shouldn’t just strive to be the #1 company in this market, unless offers some meaningful benefits), competitive landscape of commodity environment, and the chain of events that happens if price is decreased\nAgain, the case is more an intellectual discussion of key micro-economic and/or strategic factors as opposed to “such and such” is the “right answer”.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: increase sales/revenue; market entry.\nConsulting Firm: Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) first round job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: household goods & consumer products; cosmetics & beauty products.\nCase Interview Question #00606: Booz Allen Hamilton was recently retained to work with the newly appointed Vice President of International Business at a Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) company. The CPG company, Neutrogena, is headquartered in Los Angeles, California and has 95% of its sales in the US.\nNeutrogena has 3 product lines: skin care, hair care and cosmetics. The majority of its sales and the focus of this case are on its sun care products, like sunscreen or sun tan lotion. Sunscreen (a.k.a. sunblock, sunburn cream or block out) is a lotion, spray, gel or other topical product that absorbs or reflects some of the sun’s ultraviolet (UV) radiation on the skin exposed to sunlight and thus helps protect against sunburn. The company’s total revenues from sun care products was about $1 billion for last year.\nNeutrogena was recently acquired by a large multinational medical devices, pharmaceutical and consumer packaged goods manufacturer Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ). As it has a very broad international presence selling healthcare related consumer products, the new parent company Johnson & Johnson wants to double its international sales in the sun care product division by 2013. Currently Neutrogena’s international sales, only 5% of total annual sales, are seemingly random, with no real vision or strategy behind it. Distribution is in diverse markets.\nWe were hired by the newly appointed VP of International Business at Neutrogena to help our client in determining how best to approach this growth prospect.\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate if requested)\nBelow are the facts given by the interviewer on the international markets for sun care products.\n1. Market sizes and growth rates\n\n US Market: $5 billion, 3% – 4% growth\n EU (Europe): $3 billion, 6% growth\n APAC (Asia/Pacific): $1 billion, 12% growth\n LATAM (Latin America and South America): $1 billion, 12% growth\n\n2. Client’s market share and Competition\n\n Neutrogena has 2 sun care brands (60 SKU’s each) that are number 2 & 3 in the US market, combining to be larger than the #1 player.\n Neutrogena has 1% market share in Europe.\n LATAM is Neutrogena’s largest international market, and Neutrogena has 30% share in Mexico, Chile, and Argentina.\n APAC: Neutrogena is #1 in Australia, sporadic distribution otherwise.\n The top 5 players own 80% share in all markets\n\n3. Customer preferences\n\n US: Customers generally buy distinct sun care brands, for example Coppertone from Merck is the #1 brand\n EU: Loreal, Nivea are market leaders; customers prefer cosmetic brands for sun care\n APAC: Neutrogena currently sells in South Korea, China, India (minimally), customers are fair-skinned and prefer it for beauty benefit\n LATAM: Similar to US customers using it more functionally\n\nSuggested Approach:\nThe dialogue outlined below in the “Possible Answer” section mimics how the interview went, and generally reflects the approach Booz Allen Hamilton took with the client. There are 4 key sections to the case:\n\n Up front structure in approaching the problem (3C’s)\n New data on the market is given – structure a recommended strategy for pursuing specific market opportunities.\n Discuss items pertaining to a go-to-market strategy (4P’s)\n Discuss benefits and challenges of using parent company resources to distribute.\n\nPossible Answer:\nInterviewer: If you were tasked with this project, how would you begin to approach solving the problem of doubling Neutrogena’s international sales in the sun care products by 2010?\n(Note: the candidate should answer with a structured response, like the 3C’s framework shown below)\nCandidate: Well, I would want to structure the approach to look at the different customers and markets for each international opportunities, the competitors in each market, and the relative strengths and weaknesses of Neutrogena and its new parent company Johnson & Johnson in each market. Drilling down further, I would want to look at:\n\nMarkets and Customers:\n\n Overall market dynamics: size, growth, customer segments, geographies (maybe those markets the parent company Johnson & Johnson operates in)\n Customer specifics: demographics, needs & preferences, current product usage / brands\n\n\nCompetitors:\n\n Other companies in each market, respective market shares & growth, product differentiation & branding\n Overlay competitor market share and products with each region\n\n\nCompany:\n\n Think both along the lines of Neutrogena & what parent company Johnson & Johnson can add given its broader scope\n What markets both operate in, existing distribution capabilities, capability & capital available for Neutrogena’s international expansion\n\n\n\nInterviewer: That’s good. Let me tell you that Johnson & Johnson wants any growth to be self funding so no large capital expenditures. Next, let’s look at three different potential regions.\nEU (Europe) is a $3 billion overall market with 6% annual growth. APAC (Asia/Pacific) is a $1 billion market with 12% growth, and LATAM (Latin America and South America) is a $1 billion market with 12% growth.\nNeutrogena has 2 sun care brands (60 SKU’s each) that are number 2 & 3 in the US market, combining to be larger than #1 player. Neutrogena has 1% market share in EU. LATAM is Neutrogena’s largest international market, and Neutrogena has 30% share in Mexico, Chile, and Argentina. In Asia/Pacific Neutrogena is #1 in Australia, but sporadic distribution otherwise.\nCandidate: Well based on this information, it seems that from a growth perspective APAC & LATAM are the most attractive, but EU is the larger market overall. I’d also like to understand whether our 30% shares in Mexico, Chile & Argentina make up a large enough portion of the market such that 12% annual growth with steady market share could make up the $50 million in international sales we want.\nInterviewer: That’s a good observation. We have done that analysis and know that it will get us part of the way but not fully. What else would you need to know?\nCandidate: Can you tell me a bit more about the competition and the customer preferences in each of these regions so that I can recommend a more targeted geographical preference?\nInterviewer: Sure. First, note that in all regions the top 5 players have 80% market share so it’s very concentrated competition.\n\nIn the US, customers generally buy distinct sun care brands, for example Coppertone from Merck is the #1 brand.\nIn Europe, L’Oreal and Nivea are market leaders. European customers prefer cosmetic brands for sun care.\nIn Asia Pacific, Neutrogena currently sells minimally in South Korea, China, India, in places where customers are fair-skinned and prefer sun care products for beauty benefits.\nLatin America/South American customers are similar to US customers using sun care more functionally.\n\nSo, which region do you think we should target?\n(The candidate should make a well-structured recommendation that discusses pros/cons of each region and recommend one of the regions.)\nCandidate: At this point it looks like Latin America and South America are the most attractive markets to expand in given the customer preferences being similar to the US and the market growth. This of course is assuming Mexico, Chile, and Argentina don’t make up most of the market.\nInterviewer: Do you think there are other sizeable markets in that region that we haven’t mentioned?\nCandidate: I assume Brazil is a sizeable market and perhaps Puerto Rico?\nInterviewer: Very good. What about the other markets?\nCandidate: Well, APAC might be good to target given the strong growth prospects, however given that we have little share in most markets it may be tough to gain entry. We would also have to re-brand our products to match consumer preferences. Additionally, Europe is not a good target either given our low share and the mis-match with our brand/product and the customer preferences in the region.\nInterviewer: Very good. We’ve now decided that Latin America would be the best region to target and have identified some priority countries for launch including Brazil, Puerto Rico and Colombia. Thinking about Brazil specifically, what would you want to think about in your go-to-market strategy?\nCandidate: First I would want to think about pricing and how to price. We could do it similar to competitors, via cost-plus, or use a willingness to pay pricing method. I assume here we’d be more likely to price relative to competition.\nNext I would want to think about product placement. What distribution centers (beach shops, grocery stores, etc.) are currently used? Additionally, what kind of shelf placement and in-store displays are available?\nThirdly, thinking about the product itself, do we want to launch with one or both brands, how many of the 120 SKU’s do we target, and will we need to change labels to local languages (Portuguese)?\nFinally, promotion. How do we want to send out the marketing message about our product? I assume since we don’t want to spend much, localized target marketing would be best, for example signs on a beach or point-of-sale marketing.\nInterviewer: Those are all very relevant points. There is however 1 point you may have missed relative to launching in a new country.\nCandidate: Perhaps there are country law and regulations we need to abide by, especially since we are talking about a chemically based product, maybe we need government approval? Also what about tax structure and tariffs, we need to make sure those don’t eat our margins.\nInterviewer: Good. Last question, thinking about the economics of distribution let me tell you a bit about how Neutrogena has been working in some countries, e.g. Mexico.\nAfter manufacture, Neutrogena sells a case of product to distributors for $100. The distributor then owns the rest of the value chain and takes on warehousing, selling with a proprietary sales force, and manages billing and payments with retailers. They then mark-up the case to retailers by 45-50% to, say $150. What would be the benefit of taking this distribution in-house?\nCandidate: Well, first of all, I assume that parent company Johnson & Johnson has much of these capabilities already in house so we can leverage those.\nInterviewer: That’s correct. Actually Johnson & Johnson’s distribution is well established in these international markets and they distribute to the most local levels such as corner grocery stores.\nCandidate: Perfect. So I would assume that we can reduce overall warehousing costs by sharing space with the existing products from Johnson & Johnson. Also, what about the sales force in J&J? Could they take on the sun products or would we need to hire additional sales agents?\nInterviewer: That’s a good observation, actually when J&J acquired another shaving product company two years ago, the sales force learned to sell this very distinct product from medical device products, thus we can assume they can take on sun care products to the same customer set with ease.\nCandidate: Perfect, so then we can see synergies with all components we were outsourcing previously, including billings and payments. We may even be able to cut the margin to retailers and mark-up only 30-40% which in turn can spur more demand and keep our operating margins constant.\nInterviewer: That’s a good observation. In fact retailers are smart and know we would be reducing costs through this and demand lowered prices, though they may reap the benefit and not pass it on to the customer. Excellent observations. Well done! \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Consulting first round summer internship interview.\nIndustry Coverage: transportation.\nCase Interview Question #00607: Our client Peter Pan Bus Lines is a long-distance bus transportation company headquartered in Springfield, Massachusetts, United States. The company operates daily intercity bus service between Boston and New York City. They operate with buses leaving every hour from 7AM to 10PM, inclusive (meaning buses leave at 7AM and 10PM and all other hours in between), from both Boston and NYC.\nThere are 3 questions that you should answer for this case:\n\n What is the minimum number of buses the company needs to operate?\n What are some ways the Peter Pan Bus Lines company can increase profits?\n How would you value the Peter Pan company?\n\nSuggested Approach:\nThis is an analytical case asking the candidate three specific questions to answer in succession. Below is a rough outline for solving each of the three questions.\n1. The candidate should realize that a bus leaves the first shift from NYC & Boston at 7AM and will be able to make the return trip at 11AM. This pattern repeats. So, you only need 4 buses from both locations, for a total of 8 buses.\n2. The interviewer was looking for brainstorming potential solutions here. The candidate should give a list of recommendations to increase profits. The profitability framework “Profits = Revenues – Costs” could be used to guide your discussion.\n3. In valuing the company, the interviewer is looking for the broad approach, not the actual number. The candidate should first walk through a P&L (profit and loss) and then the method for a FCF (free cash flow) valuation.\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate if requested)\nThe following facts are to be disclosed during the course of the case.\n\nIt takes about 4 hours to make a one-way trip from NYC to Boston.\nFor the sake of simplicity, we will assume that the bus can leave right away to make the return trip, meaning passengers loading and unloading time is negligible.\nOne-way ticket costs $15  and there is no round trip packages.\nThere are 40 seats per bus, and assume that every bus is operating at full capacity (no empty seat).\n\nPossible Solution:\nInterviewer: So, how would you approach figuring out the number of buses required?\nCandidate: First I would need to know how long the trip takes between NYC and Boston. I believe it takes roughly 3-4 hours, is this correct?\nInterviewer: Yes, you can assume 4 hours.\nCandidate: What about the time it takes to unload and load passengers and refuel before making the return trip?\nInterviewer: Let’s assume that’s negligible.\nCandidate: OK. So assuming the first bus leaves NYC at 7am, it can return from Boston at 11am, then leaves NYC again at 3pm, and so on. I’ve drawn a diagram (see Figure 1 below) to help outline how this would work. We need 4 buses from each location leaving at 7, 8, 9, and 10am. The 11am bus in each location will be the next trip for the 7am bus that arrives there. Thus we need 8 buses in total.\n\nInterviewer: Good. So now can you brainstorm some ways to increase profits for this bus company?\nCandidate: Yes, but first I want to know a few additional points about the client company. Are we currently operating at full capacity? Additionally what is the competition like?\nInterviewer: Yes, assume all buses are 100% filled. Additionally we are in a highly competitive market and raising prices would be unwise.\nCandidate: OK. So in brainstorming ways to raise profits, profits = revenues – costs, I want to think about ways to increase revenues, reduce costs, or both.\n\nFirst with revenues, we can possibly add additional services such as selling snacks or magazines on the buses or in the terminal.\nWe could also add more departures to the schedule, however I’m not sure people would be interested in taking buses that arrive later than 2AM.\nFinally we can think about an acquisition to boost profits. Potentially with an acquisition we might be in a better position to increase prices because we’ll have more pricing power.\n\nInterviewer: That’s all very good. What about the cost side?\nCandidate: Well, first with the acquisition case I mentioned before we have potential to reduce overall costs given operational synergies such as equipment, repairs, and cost of other services we offer. Besides that, we can look at our buses and potentially upgrade our fleet to more fuel-efficient vehicles, or vehicles that will have a longer useful life or require fewer repairs. We would have to do cost-benefit analysis on such options. Also I would want to review other cost areas such as marketing, labor, and so forth, to see whether we can reduce those.\nInterviewer: That’s good. Now before you tell me how to value the company, starting with revenues can you walk through the major components of the profit and loss statement (P&L) starting with revenues?\nCandidate: Sure, after revenues would be all gross costs including fixed costs & variable costs. Subtracting these costs would give you EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). Now we can use this metric to value the company via comparable multiples if we know of any other recent transactions with bus companies. However, I assume this isn’t common so we will need to proceed further and value the company using free cash flows (FCF).\nInterviewer: Very good observation. How do you get to free cash flows from EBITDA?\nCandidate: Well, first we need the Net Income number. We subtract out any depreciation and amortization to get EBIT. Finally we apply the company’s tax rate to get net income. Now assuming there is no interest expense, we can use net income to get to FCF. If there is interest expense we need to get Net Operating Profit after tax which removes the tax effected interest expense from net income.\nNote: here the interviewer can interject and ask what would make up depreciation and amortization (D&A) – depreciation on buildings and buses, amortization on other potential acquired intangibles like goodwill.\nInterviewer: Very good. Let’s assume no interest expense here and start with Net Income.\nCandidate: OK, so FCF = Net Income – ΔNet Fixed Assets – ΔNet Working Investment.\nThe first term ΔNet Fixed Assets, or change in net fixed assets, is Capital Expenditures (e.g. new buses or real estate we purchased) minus Depreciation on any property, plant and equipment (PP&E).\nThe other term ΔNet Working Investment represents working Current Assets (Necessary cash, Accounts receivable, Inventory, other current assets) – Automatic Sources (Accounts payable, anything accrued, other non-interest bearing liabilities).\nInterviewer: Excellent. Thank you.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Last week, you received a call from Toni, an old friend from college. Toni studied chemistry in school and had gotten a job with multinational household products and consumer goods company Unilever after graduation. When the economy went sour in the late 1990’s, Toni got laid off and began cutting hair at a salon to make ends meet. In 2002, Toni quit the salon to start TIGI Linea Corp., a premium haircare products business. TIGI Linea has been a tremendous success. The company has four major product lines: shampoos, conditioners, color products and styling products. Nearly all retail sales of TIGI Linea products are through high-end salons.\nToni scheduled a lunch with you today  in order to catch up but also to ask about some issues related to his company. After you get a table and chat for a while, Toni says the following: “I think I’m ready to sell TIGI Linea It’s been over ten years and I need a break. The business has been growing since day one and I’m sure it will sell for a nice number, especially in this economy. However, before I talk to anyone, I want to know what I should expect to hear. I want to know what an investor is likely to think of TIGI Linea I also want to know what kinds of things I can do to make TIGI Linea more attractive. I’ve prepared some financials since I knew you’d ask for them.”\nToni hands you a sheet of paper with the following financial data (in million USD) and sits back in his chair.\n\n\n\nYear\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\nCAGR (compound annual growth rate)\n\n\nRevenue\n25\n35\n49\n64\n90\n114\n29%\n\n\nCOGS (cost of goods sold)\n7\n10\n14\n21\n32\n50\n39%\n\n\nGross Margin\n18\n25\n35\n43\n58\n64\n24%\n\n\nSales & Marketing\n2\n3\n4\n6\n9\n13\n37%\n\n\nResearch & Development\n1\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n12%\n\n\nGeneral & Administrative\n7\n10\n14\n19\n24\n28\n26%\n\n\nEBIT (earnings before interest and taxes)\n8\n11\n16\n17\n23\n21\n17%\n\n\n\nThis case has two parts:\n1. Assess TIGI Linea Corp. from the perspective of a potential buyer by commenting on the financial data provided and gathering more information from the interviewer.\n2. Recommend specific ways in which the business could be improved given the information made available.\nPossible Answers:\n1. Business Assessment\nThe obvious problem facing TIGI Linea Corp. is the decline in profitability from year 2009 to 2010. The candidate should quickly point this out and then spend time discussing the causes of this decline. A simple profitability framework is likely to be most useful. Issues for discussion include:\na. Declining Gross Margins: COGS is clearly growing faster than revenue. The reason for the decline is related to a change in TIGI Linea’s sales mix. When requested, the following information may be provided.\n\n\n\n\n\nYear 2005\n\n\n\nYear 2010\n\n\n\n\n\nShampoo\nConditioner\nColor\nStyling\nShampoo\nConditioner\nColor\nStyling\n\n\nGross Margin (million USD)\n70\n75\n60\nN/A\n67\n74\n54\n30\n\n\n% of Sales\n75%\n20%\n5%\n0\n57%\n11%\n4%\n28%\n\n\n\nThe addition of styling products is the most significant reason for the overall decline in gross margin. The candidate should spend some time considering reasons why margins in Styling are so much lower.\nTIGI Linea has not been able to leverage its strong brand in Shampoos and Conditioners since it entered the Styling market in 2006. Consumers believe that TIGI Linea styling products are of above average quality but are inferior to products offered by companies that only offer styling products. TIGI Linea has resorted to discounting in order to get salons to carry its styling products.\nMargins for TIGI Linea’s other products have also declined due to falling prices. It is likely that the line of styling products is having a negative impact on TIGI Linea’s other lines.\nb. Sales & Marketing Expense: Spending on sales and marketing is clearly growing at a faster rate than revenue and has contributed to the decline in EBIT. One reason is that TIGI Linea has spent heavily to promote the Styling line. Another is that TIGI Linea is beginning to saturate the salon market and must now spend more to create new customers.\nc. Low R&D Spending Growth: Spending has not kept pace with revenue growth. There is likely a connection between the lower perceived quality of the styling line and the under-investment in R&D.\n2. Improvement Opportunities\nThe candidate should recommend that TIGI Linea do something about its styling line. If the recommendation is to drop styling, some way of replacing 30% of revenue must be suggested. One solution is to begin selling TIGI Linea products in other channels (i.e. supermarkets, drug stores and/or mass merchandisers.)\nAlternatively, the candidate may suggest that TIGI Linea increase investment in R&D and improve the styling product line. However, altering consumers’ perceptions will be difficult. One solution is to launch a re-branding campaign once changes to the styling products have been made.\nThe candidate should also address the market saturation issue. It seems likely that revenue will not continue to grow at 30% per year unless new channels are tapped or new products are introduced. Given that TIGI Linea has had difficulty with introducing new products, new channels are the most likely the best source of growth.\nIf selling through new channels is recommended, consideration must be given to the following: Would sales in other channels simply divert sales from the salons or would they result in an increase in total sales volume? Would prices remain the same in other channels? What costs must TIGI Linea incur when entering a new sales channel?\n3. Math Problem\nSuppose that TIGI Linea is going to sell its shampoo product line in drug stores. Ask the candidate to write an equation or solve for the average price in drug stores that is required to create 10% growth in current salon-only revenue:\nAverage drug store price * Drug store volume + Post-DS salon volume * Post-DS average salon price = Current salon volume * Current average salon price * (1 + 10%)\nWhat is the required drug store price if:\nCurrent Salon Volume = 100\nCurrent Salon Average Price = $5 per unit\nPost Drug Store Salon Volume = 80\nPost Drug Store Salon Price = $5\nDrug Store Volume = 50\nPossible Answer:\nAverage Drug Store Price * 50 + 80 * $5 = 100 * $5 * (1 + 10%)\nAverage Drug Store Price = $3\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new product; math problem.\nConsulting Firm: Seabury Group first round full-time job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: airlines.\nCase Interview Question #00608: Our client Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) is a large low-cost carrier in the United States headquartered in Dallas, Texas. As of November 2012, Southwest Airlines operates scheduled service to 78 destinations in 39 states. The airlines does not use the more traditional “hub and spoke” flight routing system of most other major airlines, preferring instead the “Point to Point” system. Therefore, it has notably large operations in certain airports.\nRecently the President and CEO of Southwest Airlines has hired Seabury Group to evaluate a promotional campaign for one of its routes, both in terms of the economics and risks involved. The promotion aims to offer full fare passengers a complimentary ticket for one child under the age of 14 on the same flight. Should they implement this promotion? What are some of issues that must be considered?\nSuggested Approach:\nThis case was given by a former Bain consultant, involving the airline industry and it is a typical Bain style case. This was definitively a real case scenario, and the interviewer had clearly had that experience before. The candidate should take the time to structure his/her thoughts before starting discussing the case.\nThe interviewer was expecting the candidate to structure a framework, which would look at the big picture that any MBAs should have in mind about the airline industry. A strong candidate would have to arrive into final numbers as well as in a final conclusion.\nSome important elements of the case were:\n\n Contribution margin (breaking down fixed costs and variable costs)\n Consumer behavior\n Market segmentation\n\nIn this case, the candidate focuses only on the full-fare passengers. The numbers would be different if the candidate focuses on both sets of fares. For simplicity, try to make the candidate focus on the full fares.\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate if requested)\n1. The specific route that Southwest Airlines is planning to launch the promotional campaign is between Chicago Midway International Airport and Las Vegas McCarran International Airport.\n\n Seats available: 1,500,000 per year\n Seats sold: 1,000,000 per year\n\n2. Customer segmentation: Business (50%) and Leisure (50%) passengers\n3. Only two types of tickets:\n\n Full fare ($300 one way)\n Discount fare ($100 one way)\n\n4. Of Business passengers: 100,000 fly discount, 400,000 fly full fare\n5. Marginal cost of $10 per passenger per trip\n6. Percentages of children travelers will be given in the case\nPossible Solution:\nCandidate: (Summarize the case and work on a framework). This case requires us to estimate the financial impact of this promotion – revenue, cost and profit – as well as the risks involved. We want to anticipate any legal or governmental issue and competition response, and evaluate internal constrains, consumer behavior and market demand.\nInterviewer: OK. I have some data available if you need. How would you go about estimating the economics of this promotion?\nCandidate: I will start this analysis by looking at Profit = Revenues – Costs. I will break down Revenues and Costs respectively as Price * Volume and Fixed Cost + Variable Cost.\nLet me start with Revenues first. Although we could estimate the size of the market for this route (to calculate for Volume), it might be more reasonable to look at the current information the company has about this route. What is the current sales load factor of our client’s Chicago-Las Vegas route?\nInterviewer: Our client offers 1,500,000 seats per year, of which only 1,000,000 are usually sold (passengers that have actually flown during the year).\nCandidate: This represents a 66.7% load factor. In terms of pricing, how many different fares does our client sell?\nInterviewer: What do you think?\nCandidate: I can think of First Class, Business, Economy, and Discounted.\nInterviewer: Actually our client Southwest Airlines only has two different price points, Full fare and Discount. Full fare is $300 one way and Discount is $100 one way. Discount fare is usually sold al least 3 weeks in advance of the departure date.\nCandidate: Do we know the share of each?\nInterviewer: Fair enough. 40% of the customers travel with discount tickets.\nCandidate: So I am assuming 400,000 passengers were discount and 600,000 were full fares. Let me estimate the total revenue.\n400,000 discount passengers * $100 fare + 600,000 full-fare passengers * $300 fare = $220,000,000\nInterviewer: Perfect. What would the contribution margin be?\nCandidate: As I said before, I will break down costs into Fixed and Variable Costs. Aircraft leasing, crew, maintenance and airport staff are some of the fixed costs. Variable costs are actually marginal, such as meals and ticketing. Fuel would be primarily fixed but would also change according to the number of passengers.\nInterviewer: What about if I told you that we outsource luggage handling?\nCandidate: Then it would become a variable cost.\nInterviewer: Right. We ran some calculations and found out that the variable cost is $10 per passenger per one-way flight.\nCandidate: So we should then segment the customer base to estimate the economics of the promotion. Before I start doing so, let me discuss the possible outcomes of this promotion:\n\nSome of the current passengers might end up bringing their children for free, without generating any additional revenue.\nBusiness passengers might get upset with the increase in the number of children on board.\nCompetition might start a price war.\nLoss of revenue because current paying passengers (children) might get to travel for free.\nCustomers might get used to the promotion (consumer behavior) which would negatively impact the company in the case of a fare increase or cancellation of this promotion.\n\nInterviewer: Very good points. How would you go about segmenting the customer base then?\nCandidate: I guess we could break it in business and leisure travelers.\nInterviewer: That is correct. Out of the discount tickets, 100,000 are business travelers. Out of the full fare, 400,000 are business travelers.\n\n\n\nType\nBusiness\nLeisure\nTotal\n\n\nFull fare\n400,000\n200,000\n600,000\n\n\nDiscount\n100,000\n300,000\n400,000\n\n\nTotal\n500,000\n500,000\n1,000,000\n\n\n\nCandidate: (Set up data table and run the calculations) So basically on the other end of the 500,000 business travelers, we have 500,000 leisure travelers. We should also estimate the number of passengers that would bring kids along. I believe we should only focus on full fare passengers because with a fare of $300, because even with an additional passenger for free the full fare price would still be higher then purchasing two discount tickets.\nInterviewer: Good point. We ran a marketing research and found out that out of the business travelers, none of the them are currently traveling with children, and only 10% would bring children after the promotion. Out of the leisure passengers, on average 50% of them have children, and 50% of those with children are currently traveling with children. After the promotion, all of the full fare leisure passengers with children would bring children with them.\nCandidate: So, for full fare passengers, the percentage of people who bring children with them are:\n\n\n\nType\nBusiness\nLeisure\n\n\nBefore promotion\n0\n50% * 50% = 25%\n\n\nAfter promotion\n10%\n50% * 100% = 50%\n\n\n\nMost likely after the promotion we will face the following scenario:\n\nWe will lose 50,000 paying children passengers: current full-fare child leisure paying passengers who would be flying for free with their parents = 200,000 * 25% = 50,000\nWe will gain 50,000 new children flying for free with leisure passengers: 200,000 * 50% * 50% = 50,000\nWe will gain 40,000 new children flying for free with business passengers: 400,000 * 10% = 40,000\n\nWhat do we know about new passengers that will be attracted by this promotion?\nInterviewer: The research shows 150,000 new customers attracted by this campaign.\nCandidate: This is equal to an additional 300,000 passengers (150,000 paying customers along with their children). Let’s see the total impact on margin:\n\nTotal demand: 1,000,000 (existing) + 50,000 + 40,000 + 300,000 (new customers) = 1,390,000. This number is still below the total capacity of 1,500,000 passengers per year.\nLosing contributed income: 50,000 * ($300 – $10) = $14,500,000 in contribution margin.\nAdditional cost from non-revenue passengers: (50,000 + 40,000 + 300,000) * $10 = $3,900,000\nAdditional revenue from new passengers: 150,000 * ($300 – $10) = $43,500,000\nNet additional margin = $43,500,000 – $14,500,000 – $3,900,000 = $25,100,000\n\nInterviewer: Are you sure this is your final number?\nCandidate: Absolutely not. As I previously said, we should expect to lose some business passengers which won’t be satisfied with the increase in the number of children on-board.\nInterviewer: Our research shows that 50,000 business passengers won’t fly with Southwest Airlines anymore because of that.\nCandidate: This represents a loss of contribution margin of 50,000 * ($300 – $10) = $14,500,000. But still, our initial number $25,100,000 – $14,500,000 = $10,600,000\nInterviewer: You are right. Before we analyze whether there are other costs that you haven’t considered, what could our client do to minimize this loss of business passengers?\nCandidate: Our client could try to create different lines for boarding, different check-in lines and keep children seated in the back of the airplane.\nInterviewer: I like your idea of different lines for boarding. Any other cost to be considered?\nCandidate: We discussed the $10,600,000 of contribution margin, but we did not discuss overheads and sales expenses.\nInterviewer: Actually this promotion will cost our client $3,000,000 per year.\nCandidate: This leaves $7,600,000 as a net result of this promotion.\nInterviewer: So, what is your conclusion?\nCandidate: I would recommend the promotion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new product.\nConsulting Firm: Huron Consulting Group first round job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: healthcare: hospital & medical.\nCase Interview Question #00599: Our client is Bayer Diabetes Care, a business sub-division within German chemical and pharmaceutical giant Bayer AG (FWB: BAYN)’s pharmaceutical and medical products subgroup Bayer HealthCare. As a worldwide leader in diabetes care product innovation, they make equipment for blood sample test labs. Specifically, their machines are used to test blood samples for their glucose levels, meaning they are used to monitor diabetes. Their machines are very expensive, often costing more that $20K, and they must be operated by professionals. They also make the consumables that go in these machines.\nCurrently, Bayer Diabetes Care has a presence only in Europe. The market for these large blood glucose testing machines is growing very slowly and Bayer Diabetes Care is looking for more growth. Recently, their R&D department has designed patient-operated machines that can do simple blood glucose level tests. These devices are small and portable, are easy to operate, and do not need much in the way of extra consumables.\nBayer Diabetes Care is considering launching this device, called blood glucose meters or Glucometer, in the United Kingdom. They have retained your consulting firm to examine what considerations they should have in this new product launch. How would you advise them?\nSuggested Framework:\nThe first step to solving this “new product launch” case is to establish a framework. Ideally, the candidate would take  into account both internal and external factors, the characteristics of the customers, and the geographical location (why UK).\n\nInternal considerations: capabilities, capital, culture\nExternal considerations: competition, regulation, market trends\nCustomers: market size, segmentation, preferences, payment assistance\nGeographical location: why UK, why not other places, why not other value-added services for their core product?\n\nOnce the candidate gets through the framework in this case, it’s more or less listen and respond so try to think about the implications of what you’re being told and analyzing.\nThis case represents a mix of numbers and detail analysis, then the candidate should pay attention to the need to step back and consider what the numbers are telling you. Take a moment to think about the numbers in context and it should be fine.\nAdditional Information: (to be given to you if asked)\nThe UK market size of this Glucometer product is 108,000 people per year\n\n The population of the UK is about 60 million.\n 20% of that population is over 65 years old.\n Of those over 65 years old, 5% are currently diabetes sufferers.\n Of those under 65, 1% of the population are currently diabetes sufferers.\n 10% of the population buys Glucometer every year\n\nRevenues will be 2.16 million pounds a year in 4 years\n\n Price point on these new Glucometer devices today is 120 pounds.\n The marketing department project that the price will fall by 50% in 4 years (60 pounds)\n Total market size will grow by 33% in terms of people with diabetes (144,000 people)\n In four years the client Bayer Diabetes Care will have acquired a 25% market share (36,000 people)\n\nPossible Answer:\nInterviewer: So, how would you go about this case?\nCandidate: I would look at both internal and external factors, the characteristics of the customers, and why the UK vs. elsewhere.\n\nInternal considerations: capabilities, capital, culture\nExternal considerations: competition, regulation, market trends\nCustomers: market size, segmentation, preferences, payment assistance\nGeographical location: why UK, why not other places, why not other value-added services for their core product?\n\nIs there anywhere in specific you’d like me to start?\nInterviewer: Let’s start with the customers. You said you wanted to think about the market size for this new product. How would you do that? What would you need to know?\nCandidate: Well, I’d need to know the percentage of the UK population with diabetes, the total population, then the percent that could afford this device. I’d need a price as well if you wanted the market size in pounds or euros.\nInterviewer: Let’s just do it in terms of people and add in the pounds later. So the population of the UK is approximately 60 million. 20% of that population is over 65 years old. Of those over 65 years old, 5% are currently diabetes sufferers. Of those under 65, 1% of the population are currently diabetes sufferers.\nCandidate: Through my calculation I get 1.08 million people.\n\n20% of 60 million = 12 million;\n5% * 12 million = 600,000;\n1% * 48 million = 480,000;\n600K + 480K = 1.08 million\n\nInterviewer: Right, now what else do you need to know?\nCandidate: I need to know how many people will buy this device.\nInterviewer: Let’s assume that 10% of the population buys every year. How many people is that?\nCandidate: 108,000\nInterviewer: Does that sound like a lot to you?\nCandidate: Not really. We’re talking about a company that sells machines for over $20K apiece, so without knowing anything about the price of this new product it seems like this is a pretty small total market to be going after.\nInterviewer: Alright, we’ll come back to that. Assume the price point on these machines today is 120 pounds. The marketing department project that the price will fall by 50% in 4 years. Also, in 4 years they assume the total market will grow by 33% in terms of people with diabetes. In addition, in four years we will have acquired a 25% market share. What will our revenues be in 4 years?\nCandidate:\n\n The unit price will fall to 60 pounds (120 pounds * 50% = 60 pounds);\n The number of purchases in a given year will grow to 144,000 (108,000 * 133% = 144,000);\n Our market share is 25%, so there will be 36,000 people buying (144,000 * 25% = 36,000) at 60 pounds per person;\n That brings to a total revenue number of 36,000 * 60 = 2.16 million pounds.\n\nInterviewer: Good. Now how does that number sound to you?\nCandidate: It still sounds a little low for the type of growth I believe the client company is looking for.\nInterviewer: So what are some levers you might pull to increase that number?\nCandidate: There are a number of drivers. First there is the population size – you might want to include other countries or markets to increase the overall field you’re competing in. From market share, you could try to position yourself differently, maybe as the more convenient option or the most trusted one. Or you could try to keep prices high. I’d think the most logical would be to try to hit more people overall.\nInterviewer: You mentioned price. How would you think about pricing this product?\nCandidate: I would think about the value added to consumers in terms of the convenience offered and money saved. If this means they don’t have to go to the physician then they will be saving time and money.\nInterviewer: Do consumers always pay for their trips to the doctor?\nCandidate: No. Often insurance would pay, so they might be willing to do some sort of a copay for devices like this. The devices might also prompt people to keep better tabs on their blood-sugar levels which insurance companies would like a lot. After all, the major cost to insurance companies is the catastrophe, so anything cutting down those chances would probably be a good investment.\nInterviewer: Right. So if you had to summarize what we’ve looked at so far, what would that be?\nCandidate: We’ve looked at the current size of the market in the UK for consumer blood-sugar monitoring devices, as well as the growth potential in four years. There seem to be lots of benefits to the customers and to insurance companies, meaning the product should be accepted if effective. However, it seems that a product launch just in the UK market has limited revenue potential. We would recommend the client to consider including other countries or markets in introducing this new product.\nInterviewer: Excellent!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The client PepsiCo has one major competitor in beverage, the Coca-Cola Company, but no major competitor in their foods portfolio.\n\n The beverage portfolio consists of sodas, bottled waters, juices, teas, health drinks, and new specialty bottled drinks – no alcoholic beverages.\n Their food portfolio consists primarily of snack foods (for example, Frito-Lay and Quaker Oats brands) for throughout the day, i.e., breakfast, lunch, and later.\n The client’s main competitor the Coca-Cola Company is a major beverage company, and the Coca-Cola Company does not have any significant sort of food portfolio.\n\n2. The client PepsiCo’s market share is 17% across the food service market. But within this market, the market share for the client varies in the different segments and sub-segments. There are three primary segments in the food service market:\n\n cafeteria and workplace food service,\n restaurants (which is comprised of fast food, slow fast food / alternative fast food, and other),\n entertainment / theme park venues, and\nmisc.\n\nAmongst these segments, restaurants is definitely the largest, with 70% share of the market.\n3. Within restaurants segment, there are a few sub-segments:\n\n fast food (Wendy’s, Burger King, McDonald’s),\n slow fast food / alternative fast food (Chipotle, Au Bon Pain, California Pizza Kitchen Express, Wolfgang Puck’s, Boston Market, Cosi, etc), and\n Misc. (corner deli, mom and pop, etc.)\n\nThe fast food segment is dominated by our major competitor the Coca-Cola Company, who has a 70% market share in this segment. Slow fast food / alternative fast food is a smaller segment, but it is growing at 30% a year, as a part of a trend of eating healthier.\nPossible Solution:\nThis “growing market share” case is really a 3C’s case. If you use the 3C’s framework, develop questions around them that are relevant to the specific question, and probe the interviewer for new and relevant information, then you can crack the case. This is not a numbers case. Some knowledge of marketing and consumer packaged goods would be helpful. Later in the case, using the 4P’s framework to help think through the questions about how specifically to grow market share would be helpful in generating ideas.\nCandidate: I’d like to make sure that I understand the case. So, our client PepsiCo is a traditional CPG company, with a large beverage and foods portfolio. Can you tell me a bit more about that portfolio? I’m assuming that PepsiCo has sodas and juices? Do they have other types of drinks?\nInterviewer: Sure. PepsiCo’s beverage portfolio consists of carbonated soft drinks (sodas), bottled waters, juices, teas, health drinks, and new specialty bottled drinks, but no alcoholic beverages.\nCandidate: What about their food portfolio? What is that comprised of?\nInterviewer: The food portfolio consists primarily of snack foods for throughout the day (ie, breakfast, lunch, and later), for example, Frito-Lay potato chips, Quaker Oats cereals. That’s one thing that makes us distinctive from our main competitor the Coca-Cola Company- we have both a food and beverage portfolio. Competitor Coca-Cola Company only has beverages.\nCandidate: Interesting. So, they have a pretty comprehensive portfolio. Can I have a minute to structure my thoughts?\nInterviewer: Sure. Take your time.\n(Now the candidate should take a few minutes to structure the case. This will require more than just laying out a framework but also identifying key questions that will help them drive to an answer.)\nCandidate: I would like to know about three main things: (1) customers, (2) our company and capabilities, and (3) the competition and how we can differentiate between them. In those three main categories of information, there are a few key questions that I’d like to answer. This is how I might structure it:\n\nCustomers\n\n Who are the potential customers in the food service market?\n Cafeteria / Workplace food service\n Restaurants: fast food, slow fast food, other?\n Entertainment venues: movie theaters, theme parks\n Other?\n\n\nCompany\n\n What’s in our portfolio?\n Food portfolio\n Beverage portfolio\n Do we have any capabilities that are specific to us?\n\n\nCompetitors\n\n Who are our major competitors?\n What do we have that differentiates us from our competition?\n Where are our competitors strong? Where are we stronger than them? (Market shares?)\n\n\n\nInterviewer: That’s good. What would you like to start with first?\nCandidate: Well, we already talked about our company and portfolio a bit; is there anything else that I should know about our company. Like, do we have any capabilities that our competition doesn’t have?\nInterviewer: Not really.\nCandidate: Well, I’d like to know a little more about customers in the market. I don’t know much about the food service market, but I imagine that there’s a lot of that falls into the group of customers.\nInterviewer: You’re right. You’ve listed a few. Why don’t we discuss those.\nCandidate: Sure. I imagine that food service industry includes things like cafeterias, both at schools and universities. And, I know that the company I worked at before business school had a cafeteria, maybe that as well?\nInterviewer: Yep. What else do you have?\nCandidate: Well, then, there’s movie theaters and theme parks, maybe places like bowling alleys?\nInterviewer: Sure. What else?\nCandidate: Yes, there’s also restaurants. And then, there might be customers that I’m forgetting. Is there anything else?\nInterviewer: Sure, there’s probably some sort of miscellaneous group, but you’ve covered the main ones. So, of those main three, what do you think the sizes of the segments are?\n(The Interviewer is testing the candidate’s business judgment and common sense in asking for the candidate’s sense of the sizes of the segments.)\nCandidate: I think that miscellaneous is pretty small. And then, the entertainment one is also pretty small and stable. But the cafeteria and workplace one, I imagine that that’s a little bigger, and maybe it’s growing. And then, the restaurant one, I bet that’s the largest. Though, I’m not sure how fast it’s growing.\nInterviewer: You’re basically right. The restaurant segment is definitely the largest, it’s about 70% of the food service market.\nCandidate: If I think back to the original question of helping the client PepsiCo grow their market share in the food service segment, I think that I would focus on the restaurant segment. Can you tell me a bit more about that segment of the food service market?\nInterviewer: Well, what do you think about that segment?\n(Part of what the Interviewer is testing here is the candidate’s ability to use common sense to lead the case and see what they can deduce on their own.)\nCandidate: Well, I imagine that restaurants includes a few sub-segments. For a CPG company, high-end restaurants are out. But in the low-end, there’s probably fast food, delis and mom and pop shops, and miscellaneous.\nInterviewer: That’s right. There’s one big, new one that you’re missing. It’s referred to as “slow fast food”. It’s new chains with more made-to-order, healthier food. It’s restaurants like Chipotle, Au Bon Pain, California Pizza Kitchen Express, Wolfgang Puck’s, Boston Market, Cosi, etc. It’s part of people’s need to eat healthier.\nCandidate: Interesting. I imagine that this new segment is growing a lot faster than the other segments. But it’s small. If I think about the original question of the case, if I was going to try to grow market share, I might try to grow it throughout the restaurant segments. However, before I make a recommendation, I’d like to know a bit more about the competition, we haven’t talked much about that.\nInterviewer: You’re right. Well, the competition is pretty fierce in the fast food subsegment. The client has one main competitor the Coca-Cola Company. They only make beverages, and they have a 70% market share in fast food.\nCandidate: Wow. Well, given that, I would focus on the other two segments: this new “slow fast food” segment and the mom and pop segment.\nInterviewer: Great. What would you do to try to focus on them and grow your market share with them?\n(The candidate might want to take a few seconds to think about the answer to this question. It’s kind of the crux of the solution to the case. Since it’s a marketing question: how to grow market share, the 4 P’s come in as a handy framework to use to think through the case.)\n\nPlacement\n\n Are there customers in the restaurant segment that we’re not taking care of right now? New sub-segments?\n\n\nProduct\n\n Can we offer specialty products / tailor-made products to restaurants?\n Can we offer new product packaging that is specific to our restaurant customers?\n\n\nPrice\n\n Should we compete on price? Do we want to compete on price? (Price competition could grow our unit share, but hurt our dollar volume share and our profits overall)\n\n\nPromotion\n\n Can we cross-promote with our restaurant customers?\n Will cross-promotion help grow restaurant customers’ loyalty to us?\n\n\n\nCandidate: Well, there are a few things that we could do to grow our share with these customers. In terms of price, well, we could change our price, but I don’t think that we want to compete on price. That could help us grow our unit volume share, but it might hurt our dollar volume share and definitely would hurt our profits. In terms of placement / distribution, is there any way that we can grow our share by distributing to new customers or new locations?\nInterviewer: Maybe. But we already distribute to a majority of the market. What else could you do to grow market share?\nCandidate: In terms of promotion, maybe the client can create partnerships with certain customers or customer chains and run cross promotion campaigns, like advertising campaigns, or coupons. And in terms of product, maybe they can create customized products for their restaurant customers, like new packaging, or specialty sizes, etc?\nInterviewer: Yep. That’s great. That’s a good way to grow share. But can you just quickly give me some of the pros and cons of specialty or custom products?\n(Here, the Interviewer is testing the candidate’s ability to identify some business risks with new ideas – testing business judgment and risk identification.)\nCandidate: Well, on the pros side, it would build a special relationship with the customer; it might differentiate us from our competition Coca-Cola. On the cons side, our profit margins would definitely decrease on custom products. So, we might grow our share, but not our overall bottom line.\nInterviewer: That’s right. So, is there anything else, other than custom products or any of the ideas that you mentioned—that can help us grow our share in the restaurant segment?\n(Here, the Interviewer is looking for a specific answer. If the candidate doesn’t get it, don’t worry about it. You can still get the job without getting the answer to this one.)\nCandidate: Well, when I think about the information that I got early in the case, the only thing that I have that really differentiates us from our competition is the fact that we have both food and beverage portfolio. Maybe we can leverage the fact that we can distribute food products and beverage products to restaurant customers to grow our market share?\nInterviewer: Yes, that’s right. So, how would you summarize your recommendation?\nCandidate: The client wants to grow their market share in the food service segment. The best way to do that would be to focus on the restaurant segment of the food service market, because that’s the largest part of the market – nearly 70%. Within that, the client should focus on the non-fast food segments, as those segments aren’t dominated by our major competitor and are still up for grabs. And they’re growing faster than the traditional fast food segment. The best ways to grow market share within those sub-segments, without hurting the bottom line, would be to leverage the breadth of our portfolio, having both food and beverage products to offer which our competition does not, and perhaps by making custom products, where it doesn’t hurt our profit margins.\nInterviewer: Very good! You did a great job.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "title": "PE Firm MDP Calls Off Buying Family Owned Pizza Chain",
        "url": "http://www.consultingcase101.com/pe-firm-mdp-calls-off-buying-family-owned-pizza-chain/",
        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: improve profitability; private equity & investment.\nConsulting Firm: PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Advisory final round job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: restaurant & food service.\nCase Interview Question #00601: Madison Dearborn Partners LLC (MDP) is a private equity firm headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, United States. The firm specializes in leveraged buyouts of privately held or publicly traded companies, and recapitalizations of family owned or closely held companies.\nGumby’s Pizza is a family-owned American regional pizza chain based in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The chain runs pizza restaurants primarily in college towns throughout the Midwest region. As of 2011, the Gumby’s Pizza chain has about 50 store locations and an annual revenue of USD $250 million.\nRecently, the family owners of the Gumby’s Pizza  chain Mr. and Mrs. Gumby are retiring and they have put the business up for sale. You have been hired by private equity firm Madison Dearborn Partners to evaluate whether or not they should buy the Gumby’s Pizza chain.\nIn order for MDP to want to buy this chain, they need to be able to double its gross margin in 3 to 5 years. They’re looking for 2 or 3 feasible ideas of how to do that, as they would like to sell the pizza chain to another family owner in 3-5 years. How would you go about helping MDP evaluate the feasibility of their goal?\nSuggested Framwork:\nThis is a PE due diligence as well as profitability case, given that the PE firm is ultimately trying to double the pizza chain’s  gross margin in 3-5 years. Because of that, the framework used should be a typical profitability framework of revenues and costs. Then, the interviewer would need to help focus the candidate on the revenues side of profitability, where the 3C’s should be used to figure out what’s going on in the marketplace. Once the candidate has suggested that they’d like to look at profitability on any specific level: store-level, town-level, customer-level, product-level, the interviewer can start to supply exhibits to drive the case from there.\nNote: on laying out the costs side of the case, while consulting firms like McKinsey or BCG recommend a costs framework of fixed costs vs. variable costs, the interviewer often runs down the major line items on the balance sheet: labor, materials, SG&A (selling, general and administrative expenses), PP&E (property, plant and equipment). So, the candidate might want to consider using that layout to costs—it seems less “business-school formulaic” and more real world, as costs would be derived from financial statements.\nHowever, because costs are not the main thrust of this case, it’s not a big point here (but a plus for the interviewer). Also, it helps if the candidate actually sketches out their framework on a sheet of paper in landscape format. This shows that the candidate is thinking in “slide layout” format, which is what consulting is all about.\nOne way to layout the case:\n\nProfits = Revenues – Costs\nRevenues\n\n Price\n Volume\n\n\nCosts\n\n Fixed Costs\n Variable Costs\n\n\n\nOther way to layout the case:\n\nProfits = Revenues – Costs\nRevenues\n\n Price\n Volume\n\n\nCosts\n\n Raw Materials\n Labor\n PP&E\n SG&A\n\n\n\nAfter laying out the profitability framework, the candidate would need to state a hypothesis about which side, revenues or costs, he/she would like to focus on. It’s early in the case; so, really, just make an educated guess and proceed.\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate: It sounds like the client MDP wants 2-3 ideas on how to double the pizza chain’s profitability, correct?\nInterviewer: Yes, that’s correct.\nCandidate: So, profitability is composed of revenues and costs. On the revenues side, there’re two levers: price and volume. And on the costs side, there’s fixed and variable costs, or depending on what kind of data we have, we could look at major line items on the balance sheet.\nBecause this is a private equity firm client, and they’re looking to double profits in a short time period, I might focus on the costs side of the case, because it is usually easier to realize cost synergies faster than revenue synergies.\nInterviewer: Actually, while that’s a good hunch about PE clients, in this particular case, there really aren’t too many cost synergies to be had. It’d be better to focus on revenue gains. Given that, how might you structure your inquiry?\nNote: While you can use either the 3 C’s or the 4P’s, I think that the 3 C’s work better for this case, because they provide a better overview of the marketplace and work nicely with the upcoming exhibits. But really, either would work, as they’re both marketing / revenue-growth frameworks and that’s the real question being posed here.\nCandidate: I would look at three things, and several key questions in those buckets in order to gain a sense of the market and competitive landscape and how they might be able to grow revenues. The large buckets are the following:\n\n Competitive Landscape\n Customers\n Company\n\nHere’s how I might structure it, and some key questions that I’d like to ask in each bucket:\n3 C’s Framework with Key Questions\n\nCompetitive Landscape\n\n Are there any national chains in this market?\n Are there any regional / local competitors?\n Any new entrants?\n\n\nCustomers\n\n What customer segments exist in the market?\n Students?\n Faculty?\n Others?\n\n\nCompany\n\n How has the pizza chain’s profitability varied over time?\n By store?\n By region?\n By product?\n\n\n\nInterviewer: That’s great. You brought up some interesting things. What kind of hypotheses do you have about the competitive landscape?\n(At this point, the candidate should use their common sense about pizza chain restaurants. The interviewer is mainly trying to test their common sense and see what types of hypotheses the candidate can generate. It’s fine, probably better, for this to be more of a conversation.)\nCandidate: You mentioned that Gumby’s Pizza is a family-owned pizza chain operating in college towns in the Midwest. I imagine that there are national pizza chains that are also in those towns. I bet that those chains make the market pretty price competitive. I also wonder whether there are other local mom and pop pizza restaurants in the towns that make competition even heavier.\nInterviewer: That’s great. We actually have some data on the competition.\n(Note: At this point, the interviewer should give the candidate the two exhibits. The candidate should do a couple of things. First, they should say what data is on each slide. That way, they show that they are thinking out loud, and they are sure to not miss any data on the slides.\nSecond, they should make a summary of what the data on the slides tells them about the key question that they’re trying to answer here: can the client MDP double the pizza chain’s profits by growing the revenues side significantly in the next 3-5 years? And then, the candidate should definitely try to synthesize at the end!)\nExhibit 1: Average Market Share by Customer Segment\n\nExhibit 2: Average Market Share by Consuming Segment\n\nSo, what kind of conclusions would you draw from this?\nCandidate: Well, Exhibit 1 tells me that Gumby’s Pizza has significant market share in the Student customer segment: about 60%. It might be hard to grow it anymore in that segment. However, in the Faculty / Staff and Town Folk segments, there’s lots of room for Gumby’s to grow their share—they’re down at about 30% amongst the faculty crowd and only 5% in the town folk crowd. However, the competitors in those segments look like national chains competitors like Dominos and Papa Gino’s—I imagine that those are pretty tough competitors—particularly on price. I also would want to take into account the size of the segments in prioritizing them and trying to grow revenues in them.\nExhibit 2 shows that we’re the strongest—with about a 40% market share—in the delivery segment of the market. Luckily, that’s the largest segment. The dine-in segment looks like it’s dominated by a couple of the national chains, and it’s pretty small anyway. But the delivery and carry-out segments seem more divided, still up for grabs.\nGiven this new information, if I wanted to grow revenues quickly for the client—I think they have a 3-5 year time frame, I would focus on growing Gumby’s share in the delivery and carry-out segments, and with the faculty / staff and maybe the town folk customer segments.\nInterviewer: That’s great. Is there any other information that you’d like to see in order to make a more refined decision on who you would target and how to grow revenues?\n(Note: This is where the interviewer wants to see the candidate “drilling down” on their data and hypotheses. The interviewer is also looking for the candidate to start synthesizing and tying all the data and case together. It’s always great to refer back to the original question in the case—which was profitability, not revenues.)\nCandidate: Well, the original question of the case was about profitability, not revenues. I might want to understand more about which types of segments are the most profitable before deciding where to grow my revenues. I mean, maybe the carry-out and delivery services have different profit margins—I would want to know profitability by service type, or even by customer type, if that’s different.\nInterviewer: Well, that’s a good idea. Unfortunately, we don’t have exactly the profitability data that you’re looking for, but we have something close to it—Exhibits 3 and 4 have some profitability data that may help you.\n(Now, the interviewer should give the candidate the last two exhibits, and the candidate should go through the same exercise as before, but look to synthesize and wrap up the case.)\nExhibit 3: Revenues by Customer Segment and Product\n\nExhibit 4: Profitability by Product Type\n\nCandidate: Well, Exhibit 3 shows me the product mix by customer segment, and Exhibit 4 shows the profitability by product type. Taken together, these tell me that if I do want to target the faculty / staff and town folk customer segments to grow revenues that I really should do it by trying to get them to buy more of the more profitable products—which are sandwiches and drinks, which have profit margins of 47% and 53%.\nInterviewer: Yep, that’s right. Now how could you do that?\nCandidate: We could offer coupons that encourage drink-buying, or even just mention that you sell drinks when people place an order. You could offer more types of drinks—maybe people would buy more drinks if they carried a wider variety? You could advertise that you have sandwiches—revenues for sandwiches are half that of pizza, they could probably really grow that. Maybe they should change the name to “Gumby’s Pizza and Sandwiches”. Maybe they could pepper the college campus with flyers about sandwiches and drinks—that would help grow the most profitable products amongst the two largest segments—students and faculty / staff.\n(Note: The candidate should say a lot of ideas here—doesn’t matter how great they are, but the interviewer is looking for creativity and brainstorming here.)\nInterviewer: That’s enough ideas. Let’s focus on your drinks idea. Let’s say that Gumby’s Pizza currently sells each drink for $2 per drink on average. Say that they want to double their gross margins through selling drinks. How many drinks would they have to sell to do that?\nCandidate: Well, at the beginning of the case, you said that their annual revenues were $250 Million. It looks like from Exhibit 4 that their gross margins right now are around 40%, is that about right?\nInterviewer: Sure, 40% is about right, just to make it easier.\nCandidate: So, their current profits are 40% of $250 Million, which is about $100 Million. In order to double that, they would need to make $100 Million more in profits on drinks. If the margins on drinks are 53% at $2 per drink, then, that would mean that they would need to sell about 100 million more drinks each year. Right now, they’re selling about 2.5 million drinks (from y-axis of Exhibit 4); so, that seems really ambitious even over a 3-5 year time horizon.\nInterviewer: Right, so what does that tell you?\nCandidate: Well, the initial question in the case was: should the private equity client MDP buy Gumby’s Pizza chain? The key question that we needed to answer was: are there 2-3 feasible ideas that could double the pizza chain’s gross margins in 3-5 years. We looked at growing profitability on the revenues side, and while it looks like there’s room for Gumby’s to grow revenues—and profits—in customer segments like faculty / staff and town folk through highly profitable products like drinks and sandwiches, the growth that would be needed to meet the client’s time horizon and financial target doesn’t seem feasible.\nInterviewer: So?\nCandidate: I would recommend that they do not buy Gumby’s Pizza from the analysis that we did today.\nInterviewer: Great! Thank you.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

We should enter this market and use our extra capacity to meet it.\nGood Answer\nWhile the commercial glass sales are clearly more profitable, our low utilization rate (40% at present) allows us to participate in both the residential and commercial markets concurrently. Selling into the residential market would need establishing some new sales contacts, but our reputation will help us do that quickly.\nIf we produce at our full capacity (80% or above), our total costs will be $3.50 for Type A glass, $5.00 for Type B, and $6.50 for Type C (see the data table below: Projected Cost Structure and Profit of Guardian Industries Residential Glass). At these prices we can competitively match the residential market leader PPG Industries’ pricing and still make a profit. Additionally, this will help our profit margins in our commercial business. What is important to note is that we should not sacrifice any commercial sales for residential sales because the commercial sales are significantly more profitable across all three types of glass.\n4.

Comparison of regular railway and high-speed railway\n\nThe regular railway line distance between Beijing and Shanghai is about 1,320 kilometers or 820 miles.\nDue to low speed and frequent stops, it takes about 12 hours to travel between Beijing and Shanghai by regular railway.\nThe proposed Beijing–Shanghai high-speed railway will be of similar line distance, and will be parallel to the conventional railway.\nDesigned for a maximum speed of 450 kilometer per hour, the high-speed train will take only 3 hours to travel between Beijing and Shanghai.\n\n2. Population\n\n The population of Beijing is 19.5 million as of 2010.\n The population of Shanghai is 23 million as of 2010.\n\n3. Capital requirement of the project\n\n Fixed costs: USD $2.5 billion, this includes the costs of railway infrastructure, railway stations, high-speed trains, and license of technology.\n Variable costs (operational): USD $50,000 per high-speed train per day\n\nPossible Answer:\nTo make a “go” or “no-go” decision, essentially one has to evaluate the projected profitability of the project. The candidate will have to carefully weigh the costs and benefits of the proposed high-speed railway project. The “Profits = Revenues – Costs” framework seems the right way to start with.\n\nProfits = Revenues – Costs\nRevenues\n\n Price\n Volume\n\n\nCosts\n\n Fixed Costs\n Variable Costs\n\n\n\n1. Market Sizing: estimate the passenger volume of the high-speed railway\nWays to determine this:\na. Population of these two cities\nThe candidate should have a general sense of the population of Beijing and Shanghai. But for simplicity, let’s say 20 million people in each city. But not everyone can afford the high-speed train service, since we will probably charge a premium over regular railroad services.\nb. Market size of competitive services\n\nRegular railroad\n\n The curent passenger volume of regular Beijing-Shanghai railways is about 8,000 people each way per day.\n\n\nAirlines\n\n There are 20 flights each way between Beijing and Shanghai every day. Each flight holds on average 150 people.\n\n\n\nSo, who is the high-speed train’s real competition?\n\nIt takes 12 hours to travel between Beijing and Shanghai one way by regular railroad.\nThe flight time between Beijing and Shanghai is 1.5 hours.\nOur high-speed train will take 3 hours to go between Beijing and Shanghai one way.\n\nHowever, with travel time between city and airports, security check, waiting at the airport and everything else, we estimate that our high-speed train will be 1 to 1.5 hour faster than airplanes. Also, if someone is willing to spend 12 hours on a train, they are unlikely to be our target customer!\nTherefore, the real competition comes from air travel.\n2. Pricing: how much should we charge for high-speed train service?\na. Look at our cost to see what margins we need:\n\nFixed costs (infrastructure): USD $2.5 billion\nVariable costs (operational): $50,000 per train each day\n\nb. Look at people’s willingness to pay:\n\n Round trip flights between Beijing and Shanghai cost about RMB 3,000 or USD $500. Can we charge $500 for the high speed train, too?\n\nOne way to determine customer’s willingness to pay is through customer survey.\nBased on our initial study, the number 1 criterion of our target customers (business travelers) is speed, followed by flexibility of the service schedule, i.e. we need to be servicing as frequently as the flights. We also found that we cannot charge more than $500 as corporate clients are unlikely to reimburse a price higher than the flight fare.\n3. Cost-Benefit Analysis  and Breakeven Calculation\nSo, to match the airlines, we need to have at least 20 high-speed train departures each way every day, for instance, say hourly departure between 4am and 11pm.\nGiven our one-way travel time of 3 hours and say, another hour for cleaning, unloading, train inspection, etc., we need at least 4 trains for hourly departure in both Beijing and Shanghai, for a total of 8 trains at least. Given USD $50,000 per high-speed train per day, the total variable costs will be $50,000 * 8 = $400,000 per day.\nIf we are able to capture 100% of the airline market and charge $500 each round trip, we have $500 per round trip * 20 round trips * 150 passengers per round trip = $1.5 million in revenue per day. But is it realistic for us to capture 100% of the airline market?\nAt this stage, the candidate should ask for the penetration rate for similar projects. The interviewer can tell the candidate that the Thai government built a similar high-speed railroad system in Thailand before and their penetration rate was about 30% after three years.\nIf we assume a similar penetration rate for the Beijing–Shanghai high-speed railway, i.e. 30%, then daily revenue will be $1.5 million * 30% = $450,000, which is $50,000 higher than our daily cost of $400,000.\nBreak-even point\nGiven that the project has a fixed costs of USD $2.5 billion for infrastructure, it would take the Chinese Ministry of Railways roughly $2.5 billion / $50,000 per day = 50,000 days, or 50,000 days / 365 days per year ~= 140 years to break even.\n4. Final Recommendation\nNow, ask the candidate to present a summary and recommendation at this point. Based on financial considerations, this project will be profitable eventually, but it will need to take 140 years to breakeven. Whether this is a “go” or “no-go” decision is totally up to the candidate.\nThe candidate should also explore other use of the new railroad, e.g. transportation of perishable goods, express mail, etc. (Note to the interviewer: for this case, we expect passenger fare to be the major source of income.)\nOther interesting points for discussion include:\n\n lower price to increase sales volume\n educate customers or heavy promotion to increase market penetration\n expected growth of the market\n national pride associated with the project, i.e. once completed, the railway will be the world’s longest high-speed line ever constructed in a single phase.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: improve profitability; business competition.\nConsulting Firm: KPMG Advisory final round job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: environment & waste management; industrial equipment.\nCase Interview Question #00594: Our client Federal Signal Corporation (NYSE: FSS) is a global industrial conglomerate with about 2,800 employees and annual revenue of about USD $700 million. Headquartered in Oak Brook, Illinois, Federal Signal designs, develops and deploys solutions intended to protect people, property and the environment under brands such as Federal Signal, Elgin, Vactor, Guzzler, and Jetstream.\nOverall the client company is very profitable. They have engaged KPMG Advisory to examine one of their business subsidiaries that is under-performing. The subsidiary Elgin Sweeper Company manufactures and distributes street sweepers (Zamboni/lawnmower-like machines that a person would ride and which uses two large rotating brushes to sweep up the street as it moves by) and has been doing so for more than  50 years. While never a standout division, until recently it had always been profitable. 4 – 5 years ago, however, Elgin Sweeper Company’s profit margins started to fall and it is currently just above breakeven.\nSenior management of Federal Signal had made a decision 2 years ago that they did not want to invest in new features for their street sweeper product lines and has the approach that they don’t want to invest significant amounts of capital now (unless they can be convinced otherwise).\nKPMG’s task is to analyze the Elgin subsidiary’s performance and recommend to the management of Federal Signal what should be done. Tell me some of the areas you’d consider looking into here knowing that we only have a few weeks to finish this engagement.\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate: That’s a tight timeline, so let’s focus on big areas. Since profits = revenues – costs, can you tell me about recent trends with regard to costs?\nInterviewer: Sure. A quick look at the numbers showed costs have been fairly constant over the past 20 years, only increasing with inflation.\nCandidate: So I’m thinking I’ll then move into revenue. How has that stood up?\nInterviewer: Revenue has fallen steadily over the past 5 years. Why might this be happening?\nCandidate: It might be happening because of trends in the market, changes in customer preferences…\nInterviewer: Since you mention it, who are the customers?\nCandidate: I suppose they would be municipalities, state governments, etc. I don’t see this as being something for individual use.\nInterviewer: Usually not. That’s right, Elgin Sweeper’s customers are mostly state and local governments. So we looked into the customers and they are keeping with past trends, replacing their street sweepers every 4 to 7 years, and the number of municipalities purchasing street sweepers has remained constant. So, what else might be driving revenues down?\nCandidate: Prices could be coming down.\nInterviewer: Prices have actually remained constant.\nCandidate: So how about competition? Have new competitors entered the market or stolen market share?\nInterviewer: There have been no new competitors. The following chart shows what sales have looked like 10 years ago to now. What do you want to know after looking at this?\n\nCandidate: It looks like Competitor B has taken market share from us. I’d like to know what B is doing differently. And for that matter what Competitor C is doing differently so as to be unaffected.\nInterviewer: About 5 years ago, B introduced a new technology that used air vacuums to clean streets instead of the mechanical collecting methods that had always been used in the past. These air machines are more effective at picking up small debris like sand and small litter, and work more quickly and efficiently than the mechanical ones previously offered. Price points are about the same. B still sells mechanical machines, but the drop in our market share was directly related to the new air offering.\nCandidate: So how about Competitor C?\nInterviewer: Well, C makes machines that are far more heavy-duty, it’s really a different type of offering.\nCandidate: So we don’t compete with C in reality?\nInterviewer: No, but we could. Do you think we’d want to?\nCandidate: Not likely without knowing much about the market. They seem to have been stable and have an expertise, so unless we can offer something new to their customers I’d guess they’ll defend their position in a niche market at all costs.\nInterviewer: Good, that’s the conclusion we quickly came to on C. Now, what other information do you need to recommend something for our client?\nCandidate: I need to know if we can replicate the air technology.\nInterviewer: We can, but it will take 2 years and cost $100 million.\nCandidate: Since you said management does not want to make a significant investment, that seems unlikely. So other than that, what trends do we expect from this market going forward?\nInterviewer: What would you think?\nCandidate: I guess the encouraging news is that we’re still selling despite the new technology and the similar price point. So do municipalities and state governments need both?\nInterviewer: Good observation. In fact they do need both. So we broke the country into 7 regions, all of which needed the same amount of street sweepers overall. In the 3 regions in the north, on average there was a 22/8 ratio of mechanical sweepers to air sweepers needed. In the 4 regions in the south, it was 22/18 (these numbers do not include C’s models). For the entire country, what percentage of street sweeper sales were mechanical?\nCandidate: So, (3/7) * (22/30) + (4/7) * (22/40) = 44/70, or roughly 66% (It’s actually 63%).\nInterviewer: Yes. So why would municipalities and state governments need mechanical sweepers if air ones are more efficient, and what does this tell you?\nCandidate: I’d think they’d need mechanical ones to deal with larger, more solid things on their streets. It looks like in the south they can use more air machines which would make sense because they’d have sand and small debris. In the north you might get larger rocks, chunks of ice, etc. This tells me that the market isn’t going to zero, so maybe the company can simply protect the market share that it has, scale back production to the point where the market will be in equilibrium between air sweepers and mechanical sweepers, and keep decent margins going forward.\nInterviewer: Right, so that’s exactly what we recommended. Once we recognized these trends, we also looked for a strategic buyer, and in fact the parent company sold the street sweeper subsidiary to a foreign company that already had air technology developed. That was outside the scope of this case, though – just an interesting follow-up.\nCandidate: Very interesting case!\nNote:\nThe interviewer did not allow time for development of a framework – that isn’t the point of the case. Instead, the interviewer simply starts asking questions and they should be answered as thoughtfully as possible on short notice. Being thoughtful but remaining structured is vital here: sticking to profits = revenues – costs and drilling down on costs and revenues. This is a great case because if you understand basic drivers, it’s completely rational.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: growth; new product.\nConsulting Firm: NERA Economic Consulting first round job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: apparel, clothing & textiles.\nCase Interview Question #00596: Our client Red Wing Shoe Company is an American footwear company based in Red Wing, Minnesota, United States. The company designs and manufactures casual mid-price leather shoes and leather boots for men and women. It is a private company that has been owned by the founder’s family for more than 80 years. In addition to manufacturing footwear under their own brand name, Red Wing Shoes also manufactures shoes under the Irish Setter Boots, Vasque, Carhartt , and Worx brands.\nThe client company currently does all manufacturing at company owned factories in China. The Beckman family, owner of the Red Wing Shoe Company, wants to sell the company in 3 to 5 years, but, before doing so they target to double the EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) to achieve a higher selling price. You have been hired to help achieve this goal. How could the client accomplish this?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate if asked)\n1. Industry Background \n\n Leather shoes and leather boots is a mature market\n The market is very fragmented with many players\n The U.S. retail market for leather shoes and leather boots is about $1 billion in annual sales\n 50% of the retail markup is from wholesale\n The industry has seen 5% growth per year\n\n2. Red Wing Shoe Company\n\n Red Wing Shoes owns 30% of the current U.S. wholesale market\n Their main distribution is major department stores\n The client has a gross margin of 50%\n\nPossible Answer:\nThe interviewer should provide background numbers on the leather shoes and leather boots market. The candidate should do a good job driving through the numbers to find the client company’s current and projected EBIT. Then the candidate should brainstorm options for growing the business. When presented with further information regarding new products, the candidate should describe both positive and negative aspects of launching new products.\nquantitative analyses and qualitative evaluations\nInterviewer: First of all, let me provide you with some facts we have drawn out regarding the market, as well as our client’s operations. Go through the numbers and determine what our clients current EBIT, as well as its projected EBIT is 3 years from now, assuming it makes no changes in its current business model? (presents figures of the “Additional Information” mentioned above)\nCandidate: (processes the numbers, determines the wholesale market size, the client’s market share, the client’s current EBIT, and forecasted EBIT in three years).\n\nThe entire retail market = $1 billion\nWholesale market = 50% = $500 million\nRed Wing Shoes’ market share = 30%, or $500 million * 30% = $150 million\nRed Wing Shoes’ gross margin = 50%\nRed Wing Shoes’ annual profit = $150 million * 50% = $75 million\nIndustry growth rate = 5%\nEBIT in Year 1 = $75 million * (1 + 5%) = $78.75 million\nEBIT in Year 2 = $78.75 million * (1 + 5%) = $82.69 million\nEBIT in Year 3 = $82.69 million * (1 + 5%) = $86.82 million\n\n* Note: Retail and Wholesale are different. Manufactures like the client are often the wholesalers who sell to retailers. Thus retail buyers are direct customers of the client.\nInterviewer: Those numbers look accurate, now let’s talk about growing the EBIT by 100% in 3 years. What alternatives might our client pursue with hopes of achieving this goal?\nCandidate: There are several alternatives the client can pursue. These include:\n1. Extend exsiting product lines, e.g. produce other kinds of shoes\n2. Make private labels for other companies – Many retail companies look for opportunities to grow. One way is by selling footwear. For example, Polo casual shoe division is produced by an outside company.\n3. Become a licensee – similar to private label idea. However, this will create higher profit for our client because licensing fee is usually 5% – 10% of total sales.\n4. Increase distribution channel – internet/online sales, mom and pop shops, boutiques. The industry is extremely fragmented. Use Red Wing Shoes’ long family history and reputation as an advantage.\n5. International expansion – tap into the markets that are similar in fashion taste to the US market, i.e. Canada. China might be a good choice too since our client’s shoes and boots are produced there. In addition, China is a large market.\nInterviewer: Lots of those sound interesting. We actually have already collected some information regarding possible new product launches. Based on this information, what are some of the pros and cons of the following two alternatives, and which would you recommend? (the interviewer presents the table below)\n\n\n\n\nLeather Accessories Market (gloves, purses, wallets, belts etc.)\nHigher-end Shoes (evening shoes, dress shoes)\n\n\nWholesale Market Size\n$500 million\n$200 million\n\n\nGross Margin\n40%\n50%\n\n\nAnnual Growth\n3%\n15%\n\n\nOther Market Info\nHighly fragmented\n3 major brands dominate the market\n\n\n\nCandidate: Based on the provided information, I think the pros and cons break down something like this:\nArguments for Leather Accessories:\n\n Larger wholesale market. Our client is looking for short term growth strategy (3 – 5 years) and this product would give higher profit.\n It is a highly fragmented market thus with our client’s reputable history and existing relationships with buyers, our client can become a dominate player quickly.\n Higher probability of a consumer buying a pair of shoes and purse than two pairs of shoes in one shopping trip.\n In fashion, it is difficult for a low end brand to trade up to a higher end market.\n\nArguments for Higher-end Shoes:\n\n There is no need to invest money on  PP&E (property, plant and equipment). Our client can use current existing facility with minor changes.\n Higher future growth.\n The client can use the same sales force to sell the product.\n The client already has relationships with shoe buyers in department stores.\n Our client is known as a reputable shoe maker. The customers already know and trust our brand and product.\n\nWeighing the two alternatives against each other, I would recommend targeting the X market for reasons A, B, and C (here, which market the candidate actually selects is not as important as the clarity and content of the argument presented).\nInterviewer: Very good!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The company provides a variety of corporate insurance products and services including health, life, dental, vision, and Medicare insurance and health care service plans, and has one of the largest provider networks in California.\nTraditionally the client Blue Shield of California’s growth has been achieved in two ways:\n\n Adding new accounts, i.e. adding more companies as their clients\n A growth within the account, i.e. the companies adding more employees to the corporate insurance program.\n\nThere are a couple of trends in the insurance market in the aftermath of the recent financial crisis. First, it seems like companies are cutting back in offering their employees insurance program and there are many employees that are left with the option of either to pay for insurance themselves or stay without it. The second trend is that the largest growing segment in the insurance market is people over 65 (Note to interviewer: this might have been a red herring).\nIn light of these trends, the CEO of Blue Shield of California wants to know how they can increase their revenue growth. What would you recommend?\nPossible Solution:\nThe candidate should do a good job brainstorming different options for growing revenues (qualitative evaluations). This portion of the case is relatively open ended. Eventually, the interviewer presents a new target market (privately insured market) and target financials, and the candidate should successfully crunch the numbers (quantitative analyses). Finally, the candidate should conclude by giving a supported opinion regarding whether the required market share is feasible.\nInterviewer: So, what options can you think of to spur revenue growth?\nCandidate: (brainstorms various qualitative options)\n\nAdding more accounts\nCross selling different insurance products/services\nOffering new products/services\nExpanding geographically\nEntering the private and personal insurance market\nMerging, acquiring, etc\n\nInterviewer: Those all seem like reasonable options to consider. Now let’s suppose we identified the privately insured market as a good opportunity for our client, what issues should the client consider before going in?\nCandidate: Before entering the private insurance market, we should consider various factors such as market trends and growth rate, competition, existing product offerings (and how they differ from the client’s), different marketing methods (add telemarketers department), different distribution channels, etc.\nInterviewer: We did some internal and external information gathering and came of with the following figures. If our client wants to achieve incremental 10% profit growth over the next three years, what growth rate does the target market (privately insured market) need to experience? When determining this, it’s reasonable to assume that we will capture a market share comparable to what we have today in the public/corporate market.\nAdditional Information: (if the candidate asks) profit growth rate from the client’s current market is expected to be 25% over the next 3 years.\nInterviewer presents Exhibit 1: California insurance market size.\n\nOur Client:\n\n Number of people insured: 1 Million\n Premium revenues: $2 billion\n Net income: $200 million\n\nCandidate: (Crunches the numbers)\n\nThe market size of privately insured market: 3% of market = 20 million * 3% = 600,000 people\nCompany insured market size: 20 million * 50% = 10 million people\nOur client’s current market share: 1 million / 10 million = 10%\nClient’s current profits: $200 million\nIncremental profits from privately insured market in 3 years: 10% of $200 million = $20 million\nCurrent premium revenues = $2 billion = 1 million people * average premium,\nThe average premium = $2 billion / 1 million = $2,000\nClient’s margins are: $200 million / $2 billion = 10%, i.e. client makes 10% * $2,000 = $200 in profit from every insurance sold.\n\nThe client wants to achieve $20 million in incremental profits in the next 3 years, that is, they should get an additional $20 million / $200 = 100,000 privately insured people.\nIf the client captures 10% of the privately insured market, then let 100,000 people = 10% of this market, which means that in 3 years, the privately insured market size will need to be 100,000 / 10% = 1 million people.\nInterviewer: Good. Given the situation, how likely do you think it is that the market expands that much over the next three years and our client captures 10% of the privately insured market.\nCandidate: Given the trends in the market discussed earlier, I think it is reasonable that 400,000 people would switch from public insurance to private insurance over the next three years, thus boosting the private market to the target 1 million. Also, as our client already provides so much insurance coverage, although indirectly through corporations, it seems likely that a 10% market share can be achieved.\nInterviewer: Great! I think we can stop here for now. Any questions for me?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: merger and acquisition (M&A).\nConsulting Firm: PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Advisory first round job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: healthcare: hospital & medical.\nCase Interview Question #00598: Our client Advanced Medical Optics, Inc. (AMO, NYSE: EYE) is a global medical supply company and one of the leading manufacturers of eye surgery equipment. AMO is based in Santa Ana, California, and employs approximately 4,200 worldwide. The company has operations in 24 countries and markets products in approximately 60 countries. In February 2009, Advanced Medical Optics was acquired by global pharmaceuticals and healthcare giant Abbott Laboratories and was renamed Abbott Medical Optics.\nAMO’s products in the ophthalmic surgical line include laser vision correction systems, intraocular lenses, phacoemulsification systems, viscoelastics, microkeratomes and related products used in cataract and refractive  surgery. The company also produces lasers for post-operational procedures and adjustments. They don’t actually make the lasers or devices used for LASIK (Laser Assisted in-Situ Keratomileusis) – rather, they are complementary products for this procedure.\nThe global market for these devices is growing, but at a declining rate. As a result, the client AMO wants to get into a higher growth area, so they are looking at acquiring a company called IntraLase Corp. that makes inter-ocular devices. These devices are used instead of LASIK but with similar effectiveness, and they are used for two major categories of patients:\n\nPatients with cataracts (a clouding that develops in the crystalline lens of the eye or in its envelope (lens capsule), obstructing the passage of light)\nRefractive surgery to correct near sightedness (myopia) or far sightedness (hyperopia)\n\nHow would you approach this opportunity? What would you look at?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate if asked) \nThe U.S. population is roughly 300 million:\n\n 75% of the U.S. population over 65 has cataracts\n Assume that the U.S. population is evenly distributed over 80 years, and the same number of people are each age\n When someone turns 65, they have a 75% chance of getting cataracts, and if they don’t get it immediately they will never get it\n 1/3 of the U.S. population is near-sighted and 1/4 of the population is far-sighted, so 175 million people in the U.S. need vision correction of some kind\n\nThere are government caps on pricing for cataracts surgery and that there is substantial competition from major national players.\nThe refractive market is still very fragmented and growing rapidly – 1.5 million surgeries per year will grow to 3-4 million as procedures become safer. Also, the patient pays 10 times as much for refractive surgery as a cataracts patient would pay.\nAlso, the candidate asked about the specifics of what the machines were so as to consider synergies between the two companies and product offerings. There would be significant synergies and that is a component of answering the case.\nSuggested Approach:\nGiven that we’re looking at a company with an existing product line that is exploring moving into a related product line, we need to understand any links between the two. It is vital that the candidate demonstrates his/her acknowledgement of the risks of cannibalization and the benefits of synergy between the old and new lines.\nAlso key is to show an understanding of some of the basics of mergers and acquisitions (M&A). On a high level, a framework looking into internal factors of both the target company IntraLase Corp. and the acquirer AMO (such as culture, finances, and the synergies there might be between the two), external factors such as market trends and competition, and customer factors (both doctors and patient segments) is necessary. The candidate should also remember the significance of the valuation of the target company – is it worth the asking price.\nThis M&A case is fairly simple if you hit the numbers – take your time and get them right. The overall framework was very helpful as the candidate was able to reference it multiple times during a fairly focused case discussion. The key is identifying that there will be different types of customers for each product offering, so suggesting identifying customer segments up front seemed to be a major plus.\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate: First, I would look into internal factors of both the target company IntraLase Corp. and the acquirer AMO (such as culture, finances, and the synergies there might be between the two), external factors such as market trends and competition, and customer factors (both doctors and patient segments). Related to all of these would be the valuation placed on the target company. If we could, I’d like to start with drilling down on the customers.\nInterviewer: OK, I like that. So let’s talk about the cataracts patients. If I were to tell you that 75% of the U.S. population over 65 has cataracts, how many potential patients are we talking about?\nCandidate: Well, I know that 12% of the U.S. population is 65+, so let’s call that 10% for simplicity. 10% of 300 million is 30 million. 75% of that is 22.5 million. But some of those people might already have had surgery.\nInterviewer: Good point. And it gets a little dicey because the segment would be skewed towards 65. So here is a simplifying assumption – let’s assume that the US population is evenly distributed over 80 years, the same number of people are each age. When someone turns 65, they have a 75% chance of getting cataracts, and if they don’t get it immediately they will never get it. What’s the market size thinking this way?\nCandidate: OK, so we have 300 million people over 80 years. That’s 3.75 million people in each year age bucket. So it would be 3.75 million people turning 65 every year. If 75% of them get cataracts, that’s roughly 2.9 million people a year. Plus some percentage of the population already over 65, I’m thinking right around 3 million people a year.\nInterviewer: Does that make sense?\nCandidate: I don’t know a lot about cataracts, but it seems to. I’m not sure all of those people currently get laser eye surgery, though.\nInterviewer: Right. OK, now let’s turn our attention to the refractive surgery market. So your research tells you that 1/3 of U.S. the population is near sighted and 1/4 of the U.S. population is far sighted. Assume that those numbers already include those who’ve had their vision corrected.\nSo, wow many people are we talking about for the potential market size?\nInterviewer: 1/3 + 1/4 = 7/12; 7/12 * 300 million people total = 175 million people (shortcut: 1/3 of 300 = 100, 1/4 of 300 = 75, 100 + 75 = 175 million)\nInterviewer: Right. And it turns out that it translates to 1.5 million people a year actually getting refractive surgery. So if we acquire this company and can position it as a cataracts provider or a refractive surgery provider, which should we position it as? (Note: the machinery would be slightly different, enough so that it would be beneficial to go after one market or the other).\nCandidate: OK, so I know that the cataracts market is around 3 million a year and the refractive surgery market is 1.5 million a year. But I don’t know anything about profitability so I can’t really say. Can you tell me a bit about the markets?\nInterviewer: What do you want to know?\nKey information to give to candidate: There are government caps on pricing for cataracts surgery and that there is substantial competition from major national players. On the other hand, the refractive market is still very fragmented and growing rapidly – 1.5 million will grow to 3 – 4 million as procedures become safer. Also, the patient pays 10 times as much for refractive surgery as a cataracts patient would pay.\nCandidate: So based on what we just discussed I’d like to target the refractive surgery market.\nInterviewer: Is there anything else you would want to know before making a decision to buy the target company IntraLase?\nCandidate: I’d need to know more about the financials to give a clear answer. I’d also need to better understand the synergies and how they’d be perceived in the market. However, it looks promising given our examination of the market segments.\nInterviewer: Excellent!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: increase sales/revenues; organizational behavior.\nConsulting Firm: Cambridge Associates first round job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: Financial Services.\nCase Interview Question #00597: You have been retained by a large institutional asset manager client Legg Mason, Inc. (NYSE: LM). Headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland, United States, Legg Mason is a global investment management firm with a focus on asset management, serving institutional investors on five continents. They offer products in equities and fixed income, as well as domestic and international liquidity management and alternative investments (via a funds-of-hedge-funds manager). As of September, 2012, Legg Mason’s assets under management (AUM) aggregated to $651 billion, making it the 18th largest asset manager in the world.\nThe client Legg Mason is very profitable and doing very well. However, they know that they are leaving money on the table: they know that  they have a lower average percent fee of assets under management than their competition – lower than the industry average. They’ve hired Cambridge Associates to tell them why that is, and how to rectify this situation. How would you go about the case?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate)\nInstitutional asset management firms’ revenues are based on fees from client (institutional investors). Clients are  charged a fee, which is structured by some percentage of assets under management. You can assume 5% if it makes the discussion easier – though, the actual percent fee never comes up.\nInstitutional asset management companies like Legg Mason can serve any sort of large, investing clients: pension funds, CalPers (California Public Employees’ Retirement System), TIA-CREF (Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association – College Retirement Equities Fund), hospitals, private foundations, university endowments, etc. They do have retail division that serve individuals investors with their 401Ks and mutual funds, but this case focuses on the institutional investor side of the business only.\nPossible Solution:\nInterviewer: First of all, do you have any questions?\nCandidate: Sure, I want to make sure that I understand how the client Legg Mason’s business works. I don’t know too much about institutional investors or asset managers; so, I’d like to just make sure that I understand the business model before we dive into the problem.\nInterviewer: Sure, that makes sense. What can I tell you?\nCandidate: I imagine that as an institutional asset manager, the client Legg Mason works just like Fidelity Investments, or Capital Group Companies.\nInterviewer: That’s right.\nCandidate: And I bet that their clients can range from anyone – you and me investing our savings in a mutual fund to large investors like pension funds.\nInterviewer: Yep, that’s right. Pension funds like the TIA-CREF and CalPers, or foundations and universities are some of the bigger clients. We’re going to focus on that part of the business only: the institutional investor part of the business, not on you and me and our individual 401Ks.\nCandidate: Great. And you said that they generate revenues from fees which are based on a percentage of assets under management?\nInterviewer: Right. What’s your sense of how that percentage might change?\nCandidate: My guess is that larger clients, i.e. clients with larger amounts of assets under management, might have a lower percent fee charged to them, because they still generate more revenues with a smaller percent fee.\nInterviewer: That’s right. In fact, I have an exhibit that shows you what that looks like.\nExhibit 1: Revenue Structure for Institutional Asset Management\n\nIt shows that the percentage fees charged on assets under management is a stepped function. What would you image the cost structure of different size clients is like?\nCandidate: Well, I don’t know the business very well, but I imagine that it costs about the same to service a large client as it does a small one.\nInterviewer: Yes, that’s correct. So, what does that tell you?\nCandidate: That tells me that large clients – in terms of assets under management – are highly profitable because they generate more in revenues – even with smaller percentage fees – at basically the same cost as a small client.\nInterviewer: Right. So, go back to the original question?\nCandidate: Thinking back to the original question of the case: why does the client Legg Mason have a lower average fee than the rest of the industry, I now want to know more about the fees that they’re charging different customers.\nNote to Interviewer: If the candidate did not get these points, it’s not a big deal. But it is important to show them how the fees are structured and explain that larger clients generate more revenues and cost the same as any other client, therefore they’re highly profitable clients.\nInterviewer: That’s right on track. Let me show you some additional data that we collected on the percent fees and discounts that Legg Mason is giving to their customers.\nExhibit 2: Percentage Discounts by Deal\n\nSo, what does this data tell you?\nCandidate: Well, it’s not what I would expect. It looks like they’re giving some of the highest discounts on their fees to their mid-sized clients, not to their largest ones. This may be keeping the profitability high on their large clients, but it’s probably destroying margins on their mid sized clients, and bringing down their overall fee average. I think this shows the answer to the client Legg Mason’s question.\nInterviewer: Sure. Now here’s another question: if you were the client, what would you want to see here?\nNote to Interviewer: Here, the candidate should generate a few ideas. A bunch are listed below — if the candidate get one or two, that’s great, and you can move on. Also, it might help the candidate to give them the Exhibit so that they can draw on it, if that makes them more comfortable or helps them at all.\nCandidate: Well, if I were Legg Mason, I would want to see a few things.\nFirst, I would want to be giving the biggest discounts, or the most discounts, to my larger clients. Here, it looks like they’re giving the biggest discounts to the mid-sized clients.\nSecond, there doesn’t seem to be any sort of cap on the amount of discount that can be given. They’re discounting up to 90% in some cases – I would think that kind of discount would destroy all profit margins. I would expect for there to be a cap around 30% or something.\nLast, it all seems pretty random where the discounts are given. I wonder whether the clusters of discounts represent a certain salesman or account executive.\nInterviewer: That’s right. So, what are the key steps that you need to take to fix the problem?\nCandidate: Well, first, we will have to diagnose why the discounts are the way they are right now. So, look up who discounted what, to see whether it’s salesperson driven, or if it’s driven by the type of client. Then, we would need to monitor the discounting and keep track of it. Maybe the client Legg Mason can incent the salespeople not to give discounts?\nInterviewer: Yep. That’s right: monitoring and tracking, and then put in whatever systems are necessary to get the company’s average fee up to at least the industry average. Great. That’s it.\nNote:\nThis case dives right into data and question and answer. There’s a question that the client asked, but the interviewer hinted up front in the case question that he/she wants the candidate to do more than just answer the client’s question. This is a good case for practicing looking at data and taking the case interview past answering the question and more towards “fixing” the business problem.\nThe interviewer should expect the candidate to drive the case, but should provide additional data (Exhibits 1 & 2) up-front pretty quickly and make sure that the candidate understands the asset management industry and how the fee structure works very early on.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: improve profitability.\nConsulting Firm: McKinsey & Company first round job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: Oil, Gas & Petroleum Industry.\nCase Interview Question #00586: Our client Murphy Oil Corporation is a major global oil and gas company headquartered in El Dorado, Arkansas, U.S. that owns the whole petroleum value chain: oil rigs, refining, distribution, and retail. Conducting business through various operating subsidiaries, Murphy Oil produces oil and natural gas in the United States, Canada, Malaysia, the United Kingdom, Europe and Republic of the Congo and conducts oil exploration activities worldwide.\nOur direct contact for this case is the Head of Murphy Oil’s global retail operation. His operation consists of two parts: (1) gas sold at the pumps and (2) the convenience stores at the gas station. Recently, the profitability of Murphy Oil’s retail operation has declined, and the Head of global retail would like us to help figure out why and to come up with a plan of remedy for the next five years. How would you go about the case?\nNote:\nThis case is representative of many of the prepared, McKinsey round 1 cases, in which the interviewer actively walks the candidate through a set of qualitative and quantitative questions. The interviewer should “stick to the script” of case questions. To the effect that the candidate struggles, the interviewer can assist the candidate to get back on track.\nThe candidate should be structured in answering qualitative questions and crunch through any numbers thrown his or her way, always keeping in mind how they tie back to the larger issues.\nPossible Solution: \nQuestion #1: Over the past fifteen years, the overall number of gas stations worldwide has declined by 6%. What do you think might be the causes of this decline?\nPossible Answers:\n\nConsolidation\nIncrease in dollar volume per station\nChanging population patterns (fewer gas stations in rural areas)\nMore gas stations open 24 hours a day (so fewer stations needed)\n\nSet of Questions: comparing gas station profitability\nIt turns out there have been two other changes in the oil & gas retail market. One, the number of gas stations with convenience stores attached has increased. Two, a major new entrant has begun taking market share. Supermarkets have begun opening gas stations in their parking lots. This is not yet a major competitor in the US, where they only have 10% of the market, but supermarkets have 30% of the gas market in the UK, and 60% in France.\nThe next task for the candidate is to understand whether the supermarkets have a better business model than the traditional gas stations in the gas retail market, and if so, why. We’ll use the metric of Return on Invested Capital (ROIC): operating profit / invested capital.\nThe numbers for the UK supermarket gas sales are as follows: they sell 10 million litres of gas per year at $1.44 per litre. Their cost is 40 cents/litre. They pay 90 cents/liter in tax. The convenience store’s operating profit is $1,000,000 per year. Overhead in the industry is typically 10% of fuel sales, and that’s accurate here. The capital cost is $4 million.\nWe’ll compare it to one of our typical Murphy Oil gas stations located in downtown London, one of our busiest locations. This location sells 6 million litres per year at $1.50 per litre; its cost and tax per litre are the same as the supermarket. Convenience store profit is 20% lower than the supermarket’s. Overhead is still 10% of fuel sales, and capital costs are $8 million.\nQuestion #2: What is the ROIC of the supermarket?\nPossible Answer:\n\nTotal operating profit = operating profit from gas sales + operating profit from convenience store = [10 million liters * ($1.44 - 0.40 - 0.90) - 10 million liters * $1.44 * 10%] + $1 million  = $0.96 million\nInvested capital = $4 million\nROIC = $0.96 / $4 = 24%\n\nIt also may come out here that the convenience store is responsible for all the profits.\nQuestion #3: Without running the numbers, what do you think our client Murphy Oil’s gas station’s ROIC will be? Why?\nPossible Answer:\nMuch lower, because of the client’s cost of capital $8 million is twice as much as supermarket’s capital cost $4 million.\nQuestion #4: What do you think causes that high cost of capital?\nPossible Answer:\nThe location: downtown London. Supermarkets are typically in the suburbs.\nQuestion #5: So, given that, what other things that drive ROIC might we be able to affect?\nPossible Answer:\nIt is likely that we can’t change cost or tax, but we could lower price to sell more gas or we could move out of the city. Also, we could attempt to increase convenience store profitability since our convenience store profit is 20% lower than the supermarket’s.\nClient response to our recommendation: The client agrees with our recommendation to focus on the convenience store, and decides to set a pilot program in 1,000 stores.\nQuestion #6: What type of new products should the client introduce in their convenience stores? How would you think about what products to introduce? (the candidate was required to come up with eight answers – near the end he was helped along with “Think about what we’d ask if he came to us with product A and product B – what would we ask to be able to decide between those two.”)\nPossible Answer:\nSome factors we could use to help decide what products to introduce are:\n\nWhat does the existing customer want\nWhat products have high margins\nWhat can we (and the supplier) support logistically\nWhat can we get from existing suppliers\nWhat can we link to products that already sell well\nWhat products are needed frequently / will drive visits\nWhat products are durable\nWhat products require little shelf space (space at a premium in these stores).\n\nIn the end the decision was made to introduce hot and cold food – high-margin, low shelf-space, high-frequency (but low durability). McKinsey is currently implementing the recommendation in Europe.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Headquartered in Friedrichshafen of Germany, the company had $500 million in revenues last year (2011) and they make 50 marine diesel engines per year.\nCurrently MTU Friedrichshafen has 90% of the German market share for marine diesel engines. This past year, however, they posted a net loss of $60 million. You have been brought in as a consultant by the CEO of MTU Friedrichshafen. Specifically, the CEO has two questions that he would like you to address:\n1. What are the causes of the $60 million net loss?\n2. What are the options for this company to turn around?\nHow would you go about the case? What recommendations will you give to the MTU CEO?\nPossible Answer:\nSuggested framework: Profit = Revenues – Costs\n1. General Company Information\n\n The client company MTU Friedrichshafen currently is operating at full capacity.\n\n The company’s products, marine diesel engines are mainly used to power ships for commercial use.\n The client does not design the engines, they are made based on blueprints supplied by a design firm that the company pays a licensing fee to.\n The marine diesel engines are not going to be replaced anytime soon, and therefore can be considered commodities.\n\n2. Revenues\n\n The number of engines sold has not decreased during the past year.\n Unit price of the client’s diesel engines has not gone down substantially.\n\n3. Costs\n\n The company’s costs have not gone up.\n The company has just built a new modern factory taking advantage of all the cost savings of better production processes and automation.\n Labor costs have gone down as well.\n Cost structure of the client company:\n\n 60% materials\n 20% labor\n 10% overhead\n 5% licensing fee\n 5% other\n\n\n\n4. Competitions\n\n The client’s market share has declined from 100% a few years ago to the current 90%\n Cost structure of one major competitor who recently entered the German market:\n\n 55% materials\n 15% labor costs\n 10% overhead\n 10% licensing fee\n 10% other\n\n\n\n5. So, what’s going on?\n\nThe client’s labor is in a union and the company just negotiated a better deal for themselves. That’s why the labor costs have gone down.\nHowever, one major competitor recently entered the German market, stealing the market share from the client.\n\n The competitor makes 200 diesel engines per year.\n The competitor’s material costs are lower because of volume discounts.\n The competitor is located in South Korea where the labor is much cheaper.\n\n\n\n6. What should the client do?\nTo turn around the company, the client could:\n\n Increase capacity, build more engines per year\n Expand geographically, sell engines outside of Germany\n Expand product lines, e.g. make diesel engines for trains, heavy military vehicles, agriculture, mining and construction equipment\n Form a “buying consortium” with other companies that use the same materials in order to get the volume discount\n Lastly, if it is possible, the client may consider selling the company to a competitor since the South Korean competitor has significant cost advantages\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new business.\nConsulting Firm: Putnam Associates first round job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: healthcare: pharmaceutical, biotech, life sciences.\nCase Interview Question #00584: The client Novartis (NYSE: NVS) is a multinational pharmaceutical company based in Basel, Switzerland with international reach. It currently is the second largest pharmaceutical company in the world in terms of revenue (USD $58.5 billion in 2011). Novartis was created in  1996 from the merger of Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz Laboratories, both Swiss companies with long histories.\nNovartis is known in the pharmaceutical industry for their cancer drugs. For instance, matinib (originally STI571) is a cancer drug marketed by Novartis as Gleevec in USA or Glivec in Europe/Australia/Latin America. Gleevec is used in treating chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) and some other diseases. By year 2011, Gleevec has been approved by the United States FDA to treat ten different cancers.\nRecently, Novartis has experienced a decline in sales growth and is considering a new business opportunity. In the U.S. and Europe there are many private companies that focus solely on cancer care. The client Novartis wants to open and operate a chain of private cancer care centers in China. These would be “out patient” type medical centers where cancer patients could come in for treatments; both long and short-term stays are possible.\nHow would you evaluate the attractiveness of this business opportunity?\nSuggested Framework\n\nCustomers\nCompetition and Regulation\nCost and Revenue\nCompany Capabilities\n\nPossible Answer:\n1. Customers \nTo assess the demand for the cancer care centers, we would need to determine the number of people in China with cancer.\nWe can look at the number of people currently being treated through cancer care units of hospitals, private care, etc. Alternatively, we could estimate the percentage of the population with cancer by looking at cancer affliction rates across various countries and then multiply by the total population of China (1.3 billion).\n2. Competitors\nCurrently, there are no cancer care centers like this in China; it would be a completely new concept. Hospitals, nursing homes, private nurses will be competitors. Also, China has a history of treating ailments through herbs, Chinese medicines, and other natural substances; these old world physicians are a major competitor, too.\n3. Cost and Revenue\nRevenues are comprised of the number of treatments and the price per treatment. Since the care center would focus strictly on cancer, the quality of the service would be better than the competition. In China, most of the public hospitals are owned by the government. The government pays for all healthcares. In fact, the government has predetermined fees that it will pay for all kinds of treatments. They will not pay for more than that amount.\nSince our client is providing premium service, their costs are higher than those of public hospitals, etc. The client may not even be able to cover the cost of the care they want to provide through the predetermined rates.\nThe client needs to assess if there is sufficient demand amongst the wealthier segments of the Chinese population for a cancer care center. First, segment the population of China based upon income and focus on the top income levels. Then, apply the percentage of cancer incident to this number to estimate the number of potential cancer patients in the selected segments. Calculate the cost of serving each patient and fixed costs to determine a breakeven number of patients. Compare this breakeven number with the total potential cancer patients to determine the market share the client needs before they can turn a profit.\n4. Company Capabilities\nAlthough the client Novartis is well known in the pharmaceutical industry for their cancer drugs, they don’t own or operate any cancer care centers. There are three ways the client can develop capabilities in this area:\n\nAcquisition\n\n This approach could be very expensive\n The client gains full control\n Fast\n\n\nForming joint venture with another company\n\n The client has less control\n Brand issues with other companies\n\n\nStarting from scratch\n\n This approach could be very time consuming\n The client has full control\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Headquartered in Montreal, Quebec, the bank operates as BMO Bank of Montreal and has more than 900 branches in Canada, serving over seven million customers. As a major diversified financial services firm, BMO Bank of Montreal has 4 lines of business: Checking Accounts, Savings Accounts, Loans, and Mortgages.\nThe BMO bank is profitable, but the newly appointed CEO is on a mission to increase its overall market share in the Canadian banking industry while still maintaining profitability. Recently, he is considering increasing his sales force to accomplish this goal. There are 3 different categories of sales force he can choose to change:\n\nBranch Managers\nTelemarketers\nMortgage Agents\n\nThe CEO has come to us for advice on whether or not he should increase his sales staff. And if so, where should he be adding heads. How would you go about addressing this question?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to you if asked)\n1. The Canadian personal and commercial banking industry is made up of 5 major players: The Big Five banks (Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of Montreal, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce). They  are all very similar, offering diversified financial services and playing in all 4 segments.\n2. Market share is defined on a % of customers basis. The market shares are as follows:\n\n The #1 player Royal Bank of Canada has 20% market share.\n We are the #2 player and have an 18% market share.\n The rest of the industry is somewhere between 15% – 18%.\n\nThe market share within each of the 4 segments does not break down in this same fashion. Everyone is profitable and established and no one is pricing their products irrationally.\n3. The client company BMO’s market share by segment is as follows:\n\n Checking Accounts – 21%\n Saving Accounts – 20%\n Loans – 23%\n Mortgages – 10%\n\n4. The client BMO’s profit per transaction is as follows:\n\n Checking Accounts – $5\n Saving Accounts – $20\n Loans – $100\n Mortgages – $1,000\n\nExhibit 1. Sales Force Profitability\n\nNote: The chart above depicts the profitability of different types of sales agents with regard to the mortgage business. “Profitability” of each individual sales agent is defined as the incremental $ profit margin (in thousand $) each brings in. Telemarketers clearly bring in the most profit margin $s in aggregate, but mortgage agents bring in the most from new business.\nSuggested Approach:\nA thoughtful and complete answer to this “increasing market share” case involves discussing the overall market environment, with a look at the competition in the marketplace and the current market share breakdown. The candidate should realize that there are 4 separate markets for distinct products that have different profitability characteristics. It becomes apparent that investing in some lines of business will pay off for the company more than investing in others. From there, a discussion of the economics of each of the different sales channels will drive you towards a recommendation.\n1. Determine the competitive position of the company\n\nWhat is the competitive position of the company in the overall market?\n\n2. Assess the importance of the different lines of business\n\nWhere does the bank play? What is its strategy? How does it make its money?\nWhat is our market share in each line?\nWhat is the importance of each line to the overall business? How do the different lines fit into the overall strategy? Which lines are the most profitable? Are there any loss leaders?\nWhat can the company expect to achieve from investment in each line?\n\n3. Understand the impact of the different categories of sales force\n\nWhich lines of business will be affected by increased investment in each category?\nWhat is the expected ROI for each category?\n\n4. Formulate an investment strategy for the bank to follow\nPossible Answers:\nCandidate: Before we start, I would like to clarify what a mortgage agent actually does. Can you walk me through that?\nInterviewer: Sure. The mortgage agents work by having relationships with real estate brokers. When a broker makes a sale, he refers the buyer of the home to a mortgage agent. That agent works with the home buyer to close the transaction and sell the mortgage.\nCandidate: That makes sense. I’d like to figure out what the current market situation looks like. How many players are there and what is the breakdown in terms of market share? Is everyone profitable? Are there any new players? Any new trends like internet banking?\nInterviewer: The market is made up of 5 major players: the five largest banks in Canada. They are all very similar, offering diversified financial services and playing in all 4 segments. The market shares are as follows: the #1 player Royal Bank of Canada has 20% market share. We are the #2 player and have an 18% market share. The rest of the industry is somewhere between 15%-18%. However, the market share within each of the segments does not break down in this same fashion. Everyone is profitable and established and no one is pricing their products irrationally. There are some new trends emerging such as internet banking, but they are not a factor at this point, and the BMO CEO is not worried about that.\nCandidate: I see. Do we know how our market share breaks down in each of the four different segments?\nInterviewer: Yes, we do. Our breakdown by segment is as follows:\n\nChecking Accounts – 21%\nSaving Accounts – 20%\nLoans – 23%\nMortgages – 10%\n\nCandidate: That is interesting. Is there a different profitability level for each of the four different segments?\nInterviewer: Yes, there is. As a matter of fact, profitability per transaction is as follows:\n\nChecking Accounts – $5\nSaving Accounts – $20\nLoans – $100\nMortgages – $1,000\n\nCandidate: I would like to explore a few more possibilities, but first, I want to just say that my gut instinct is that we can increase our sales force, and I think that we should do it in the mortgage agent area.\nInterviewer: That is a good insight. Why do you think that is?\nCandidate: Based on the existing market shares, it seems like we have the most room to improve our business in this area. Additionally, given the parity between the competitors in the industry overall, I think it would be very difficult to dramatically increase share in any of the other areas. Therefore, we should concentrate on the mortgage market. From there, we need to see what part of the sales force will have the greatest impact on this market. Do we have any information on the profitability of each of the salespeople and how much new business each arm brings in?\nInterviewer: Yes, the CEO has given us this exhibit (See Exhibit 1: Sales Force Profitability).\nInterviewer: What does this chart tell you?\nCandidate: This chart shows that telemarketers are the most profitable place to put our money in terms of increasing our sales force. How are they generating these profits? What are they actually doing?\nInterviewer: They call up existing customers to get them to renew their old services.\nCandidate: I see. In that case, it looks like my initial hunch was correct. Since the other 2 sales forces will increase profits based on existing customers, the mortgage agent is where we can drive market share growth by winning new customers. In terms of making an overall profit, the telemarketers would be the right way to go. However, since the CEO has explicitly stated that he wants to increase market share, mortgage agents are where he should be bulking up the sales force.\nInterviewer: Thank you. Out of curiosity, can you give me an example of where adding branch managers might be a good decision? What would you need to look at?\nCandidate: We could do a study of each branch to see how many customers come through the door and how many of them are existing customers versus potential new customers.\nInterviewer: OK. Let’s say we did that and we found out that in each store, there are 4 branch managers and they, on average, service 40 potential new customers that come through the door everyday. What would you have to look at when deciding whether or not to add more branch managers?\nCandidate: I think you would have to look at whether or not the existing 4 managers can handle 10 new customers per day. If they can handle that amount of customers, then there is no need for more managers. In that situation, if we were to add a 5th manager, each manager would then be responsible for 8 new customers on average, but that would just create idle time and not generate any new customers. If however, there are long waiting times and potential new customers are getting fed up and leaving, then perhaps adding new managers would make sense.\nInterviewer: What else could change that could cause the bank to want to add more branch managers?\nCandidate: If you can drive additional potential customers through the door. Perhaps a changing trend in the market will create a new opportunity, i.e. adding a new product that may draw in more non-customers who are interested in becoming a customer or a new advertising campaign that is drawing in more people. In any of those types of scenarios, it may make sense to add additional branch managers.\nInterviewer: I think that makes a lot of sense. Time is running up. Let’s wrap up here. Can you make your final recommendation to the CEO? \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: market sizing; market entry.\nConsulting Firm: Roland Berger Strategy Consultants first round job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: metals production; automotive, motor vehicles.\nCase Interview Question #00588: Our client China Metallurgical Group Corporation (MCC) is a large Chinese conglomerate headquartered in Beijing, engaging in EPC (engineering, procurement and construction), natural resources exploitation, paper-making, equipment fabrication, and real estate development. With a lot of cash on their hands, they recently decided to invest money in a aluminum plant that, by the end of this year, will have a full production capacity of 8 million aluminum wheels annually. The senior management of MCC assumes that it will be able to sell 20% of its production in the domestic Chinese market.\nThe company has retained Roland Berger Strategy Consultants to determine if it can sell the remaining 80% of the 8 million aluminum wheels to the US market, which is the largest vehicle market in the world. What do  you think? How would you approach this case?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to you if asked)\n\nAbout 17 million vehicles are produced in the US each year. 70% are equipped with aluminum wheels.\n10% of used car owners whose cars are less than 5 years old buy aluminum wheels.\n120 million cars are in the “after market”, 24 million of which are less than 5 years old.\nMost car companies will select one supplier who will supply the aluminum wheels for the entire life-time of a car model. Suppliers are usually selected 24 months before a new car model goes into production and have stringent quality controls.\n\nSuggested Approach:\nThis case is essentially asking you to do two things:\n\nDetermine the size of the U.S. car market so that you can understand the relative impact of the Chinese company’s goals.\nAssess the feasibility of entering the U.S. market and provide suggestions on how the Chinese company might go about doing so.\n\nMarket Sizing: First, determine how many wheels your client MCC could supply to the US market – both in number of wheels and number of cars (1/4 of the wheel number). Then ask about the size of the US new car market and the secondary market to determine what share the company would need to capture to sell 80% of its production in the US.\nFeasibility and Possible Actions: This is where you need to drill down to uncover automobile industry dynamics:\n\n How do OEMs (original equipment manufacturer) get the wheels for the cars they produce?\n How would a Chinese company distribute its wheels to the US market? Directly or through intermediaries?\n How entrenched are supplier relationships? Do OEMs buy based on price only, or do the relationships matter too?\n What regulations are involved in supplying an OEM?\n\nOnce you understand how the supplier-OEM relationships work, you can provide some suggestions on how this company might feasibly enter the US market.\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate: OK, I’d like to first determine the production figures of the Chinese manufacturer and compare them to the size of the total US automobile market. This will help me understand the relative size of the Chinese company’s production numbers and whether their plan is realistic.\nOnce I know how much market share the Chinese company wants to capture, I’d like to discuss the US automobile industry dynamics to determine if and how the Chinese company should enter the market.\nInterviewer: Sounds like a plan. Go ahead!\nCandidate: Let’s first start with their production numbers. Let’s assume that cars require only 4 aluminum wheels and that spare tires are made out of some less expensive material. This means that our client produces wheels for 2 million cars per year. 80% of 2 million gives us wheels for 1.6 million cars, which we are trying to sell in the US. So how big is the US new car market and how large is the secondary car market (people who buy aluminum wheels for an older car)?\nInterviewer: I do have the numbers for you. About 17 million vehicles are produced in the US each year. About 70% are equipped with aluminum wheels. About 10% of used car owners whose cars are less than 5 years old buy aluminum wheels.\nCandidate: That means that roughly 17 million * 70% ~= 12 million new cars each year are sold with aluminum wheels. Can we assume that there are about 300 million cars in the after-market, about 1 car per person, considering that people in some area own on average 2 cars?\nInterviewer: No, that number is much lower. There are about 120 million cars in the after market, but only about 24 million are less than 5 years old.\nCandidate: I see. That means the after-market is about 2.4 million sets of aluminum wheels per year. Considering that our client needs to sell 1.6 million sets, they’d have to capture a 66% market share, which seems very unlikely in such a fragmented market. That means we should probably focus on the new car market. How do the major car companies procure the aluminum wheels they put on their cars?\nInterviewer: That’s a good question. Most auto companies will select one supplier who will supply the aluminum wheels for the entire life-time of a car model. Suppliers are usually selected 24 months before a new car model goes into production and have stringent quality controls.\nCandidate: Then, we probably would have to add another 12 months to even get on a company’s preferred supplier list, which increases the lead time to about 3 years before we can hope to supply aluminum wheels to a major US car manufacturer. Since you mentioned earlier that our client’s plant will be ready for production by the end of this year, this does not look like a viable option either. What about trying to expand distribution on a broader basis than just the United States?\nInterviewer: They thought about that as another option, but they would really like to work with just the US.\nCandidate: Well, assuming that our client can produce quite a bit cheaper in China than most competitors can in the US, it might make sense to sub-contract some of this production capacity to suppliers of the major US car manufacturers. This is probably less lucrative than selling directly to end-customers or car manufacturers because the client would have to share its profit margin with the supplier. That said, it would probably be the most efficient way to enter the US market on a large scale.\nInterviewer: Yes, this is exactly what they did in the end.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: improve profitability.\nConsulting Firm: Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) first round job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: Insurance: life & health.\nCase Interview Question #00589: The client WellCare Health Plans, Inc. (NYSE: WCG) is a regional health insurance company headquartered in Tampa, Florida, United States. The company provides Medicare and Medicaid managed care health plans for 4 million members in the State of Florida, and employs over 3,500 associates.\nWellcare experienced a loss of $40 million this year, after recording a $40 million profit last year. They have hired Booz Allen Hamilton to help determine the cause(s) of this decline and develop possible solutions. How would you go about identifying potential solutions for their decline in profitability?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to you if asked)\n1. Company\n\n The client company Wellcare is in only one line of business, Commercial Risk Insurance, in only one region (Florida).\n They have several direct competitors in this market.\n Currently this company has 4 million members, which equates to a 40% market share.\n\n2. Revenues\n\n For the sake of simplicity, the client company’s Profit = Premiums – Claims.\n Revenues have been stable from last year to this year. Premiums charged per member have been stable at an average of $200/year, and membership has been flat at 4 million members.\n Their cash flows originate from premiums, which are paid in on a periodic (e.g. monthly, semiannually, annually) basis by its customers, and claims are paid out to the customers’ caregivers as appropriate.\n All revenue, cost and profit figures are measured on a per-member basis.\n\n3. Costs\n\n The client company Wellcare has made no large recent capital expenditures.\n Per member variable costs are rising by $20 per year. This is largely the result of a decline in utilization of resources due to poor management.\n\n4. Within the company’s structure, there are several functional groups:\n\n New Admits\n Pre-authorizations\n Case management\n\nThese groups are staffed with MDs (medical doctors) and RNs (registered nurses) that used to be in the field treating patients. They are now responsible for managing hundreds of doctors and nurses that are currently treating patients. They are more used to working in practices of 5-10 professionals and unaccustomed to managing such a large staff, causing problems in controlling referrals and unnecessary testing/procedures.\nPossible Answer:\nThis is a typical “improving profitability” case, with the addition of a problem solving section to discuss the area that is hurting profitability. First, the candidate should hone in on what is causing the company to lose money. Look at revenues (price * quantity) and costs (fixed costs + variable costs). This will lead the candidate to the crux of the problem. At that point, the candidate should ask questions that explore the problem and identify ways to address it.\nCandidate: Since we’re dealing with a profitability issue here, I’d like to explore both the revenue and the cost side of the business. Starting with the revenue side, have the premiums charged changed over the last year?\nInterviewer: No, they have been stable. Incidentally, premiums are charged at an average of $200 per year per member.\nCandidate: Has the member base been stable? The reason I’m asking this is to understand whether revenue as a whole has been stable.\nInterviewer: The member base has been stable, so revenues have as well.\nCandidate: OK. Since revenue is stable, I’d like to explore the cost side of the business. First, let’s take fixed costs. Have they made any large capital investments to spur growth?\nInterviewer: No. They aren’t in a growth stage and haven’t made any large capital expenditures except for a new claims payment system two years ago. In general, this is not a capital intensive business.\nCandidate: That makes sense since it is a service company. So, let’s look at variable costs. Has the cost of servicing members been growing?\nInterviewer: Yes. Per member costs are rising to the tune of $20 per member per year. Why do you think this is happening?\nCandidate: The cost of care may be going up – on the doctor, equipment or medicine front.\nInterviewer: The biggest cost driver is actually utilization, i.e. how frequently the doctors use other sources for a patient’s care. So now I’d like you to derive the total variable costs that the company had last year versus this year.\nCandidate: Profit = Revenues – Costs\n\nRevenues = 4 million members * $200 per year per member = $800 million\nProfit = $40 million (last year)\nCosts = Revenues – Profit = $800 million – $40 million = $760M (last year)\nProfit = -$40 million (this year)\nCosts = Revenues – Profit = $800 million – (-$40 million) = $840M (this year)\n\nInterviewer: What were the variable costs on a per member basis for each year?\nCandidate:\n\n Per Member Variable Costs = $760M last year / 4 million members = $190 per member per year\n Per Member Variable Costs = $840M current year / 4 million members = $210 per member per year\n\nInterviewer: Good. Let’s talk about utilization now. What might affect this measure?\nCandidate: It could be a change in what MDs want to prescribe. For instance, maybe they are more risk-averse because of a rise in malpractice cases, so they are more frequently seeking second opinions. Another thing that might affect utilization is how well the company manages the MDs.\nInterviewer: To your second point, what would you look for within the company to see where the problem resides?\nCandidate: I would look at several things, including strategy, skills of the MDs, shared values, staffing, technology used, leadership system and functional organizational structure, to name a few.\nInterviewer: OK. What would you want to know about the organizational structure?\nCandidate: I’d like to know how the company is structured.\nInterviewer: Within the company’s structure, there are several functional groups:\n\n New Admits\n Pre-authorizations\n Case management\n\nThese groups are staffed with MDs and RNs that used to be in the field treating patients. They are now responsible for managing hundreds of doctors and nurses that are currently treating patients.\nCandidate: Are those MDs and RNs used to managing large groups of people (i.e., many doctors in the field)?\nInterviewer: No, they are more accustomed to working in practices of 5-10 professionals.\nCandidate: Makes sense. What types of people compose the upper management of the company?\nInterviewer: They are also MDs that used to be in the field. What’s your hypothesis about this problem and potential solutions at this stage?\nCandidate: The problem seems to be in the management of the doctors and nurses that are treating the patients. Due to the difficulty in getting all necessary data, and the fact that the staff managing those doctors/nurses is not used to managing a large, remote organization, variable costs (specifically the costs associated with utilization) have risen.\nI would recommend reviewing the current information systems for a way to consolidate the view of data for each job function so that everyone has all the necessary information to manage their cases. They should also consider providing leadership/management training for those who are responsible for case management.\nInterviewer: Excellent! Let’s stop here for now.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new product; pricing, valuation.\nConsulting Firm: Trinity Partners first round job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: healthcare: hospital & medical.\nCase Interview Question #00592: The client Cordis Corporation is a medical device company owned by Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), a large multinational medical devices, pharmaceutical and consumer packaged goods manufacturer. Cordis is currently headquartered in Bridgewater Township, New Jersey, United States. Their product lines  include stents, distal protection devices, catheters, and guidewires. In the technical vocabulary of medicine, a stent is a mesh “tube” inserted into a natural passage/conduit in the body to prevent, or counteract, a disease-induced, localized flow constriction.\nBest known for their cardiovascular stents, Cordis recently developed a revolutionary new product that is positioned to replace the current products in the market. The product, called Drug-Eluting Stent or DES, is the first of its kind. DES is a peripheral or coronary stent (a scaffold) placed into narrowed, diseased peripheral or coronary arteries that slowly releases a drug to block cell proliferation. This prevents fibrosis that, together with clots (thrombus), could otherwise block the stented artery.\nCordis Corporation wants to launch the new DES device in Europe in the near future and then bring it to the U.S. in 6 months. They are one year ahead of its competition with regard to R&D of the product. As part of a consulting team retained by the company to help introduce the new product into the market, you have been tasked with the following questions.\nQuestion #1: How do you determine what price to charge for DES device? What are the issues that need to be considered?\nPossible Answer:\nThree areas should be explored to determine the price of the new DES product:\n\nCurrent price of existing products and rationale for current price (value-based or cost-based)\nBenefits of new product vs. old product in terms of decreased side effects or repeat procedures\nBuyer’s willingness to pay\n\nAdditional items that could be considered include:\n\nThe cost of the new DES device\nTotal R&D costs (if not considered sunk costs)\nAny customer acquisition cost\nThe cost of overhead and sales force\n\nQuestion #2: What is the “Cost Neutral Point” – the point at which the cost of the new DES product equals that of the old product, given the following data:\n\n Hospital cost of an operation = $5,000 per patient\n Old product cost = $1,000/unit\n Number of units needed per operation = 2\n Frequency of repeat procedure (using existing product) = 50%\n Frequency of severe complication resulting in open heart surgery = 30%\n\nIs there any more information that you would need to calculate the Cost Neutral Point?\nPossible Answer:\nI would need more information:\n\nWhat is the cost of open heart surgery operation? $30,000\nWhat is the frequency of repeat procedure using DES device? 0%\nWhat is the frequency of severe complication using DES device? 5%\nHow many units of DES device will be necessary per operation? 2\n\nTo determine how much the new DES device is worth, we can set up a calculation table:\n\n\n\nItem\nOld\nNew\n\n\nHospital cost\n$5,000\n$5,000\n\n\nProduct cost per operation\n$1,000 * 2 = $2,000\nX * 2 = 2X\n\n\nSubtotal\n$7,000\n$5,000 + 2X\n\n\nRepeat procedures\n50% * $7,000 = $3,500\n$0\n\n\nSevere complication\n30% * $30,000 = $9,000\n5% * $30,000 = $1,500\n\n\nTotal\n$19,500\n$6,500 + 2X\n\n\n\nTo calculate the value of DES device at Cost Neutral Point: $19,500 = $6,500 + 2X\nX = ($19,500 – $6,500) / 2 = $6,500\nQuestion #3: What factors might allow Cordis Corp to price the new product above the cost neutral point? What needs to be considered?\nPossible Answer:\n\nRisk / Malpractice Insurance costs\nValue of reduction in pain (to patients)\nHigher success ratio (without repeat procedure and/or severe complication)\nCost savings of keeping fewer DES device’s in inventory, etc.\n\nThese and other factors might allow us to price DES device above the Cost Neutral Point.\nQuestion #4: The client Cordis Corp has decided that it wants to sell DES device at a premium above the cost neutral point, but a survey of potential customers (Hospital Purchasing Departments) showed that they are only willing to pay $4,000 per unit. Now what would you recommend?\nPossible Answer:\nIs the $4,000 per unit figure a single data point or an average? – An average across many customers surveyed\nThen, there are two things we can do:\n\n Manage Cordis Corp’s expectations that they should really expect something close to $4,000/unit\n Increase potential customers’ “willingness to pay”\n\nQuestion #5: How can we increase customers’ “willingness to pay”?\nPossible Answer:\nTwo thoughts:\nCommunicate the benefits, both “soft” benefits (e.g., decreased pain or frequency of re-operation) and “hard” benefits (financial) to the additional stakeholders (i.e., patient advocate groups and insurance payers) in the decision. Work with them to “pressure” the potential buyers of DES device to spend the additional money to realize the added benefits of the new device.\nPublish research articles about the efficacy of the new device in reputable medical journals, e.g., Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), New England Journal of Medicine, The Lancet, etc. and use those to convince doctors to pressure hospital administration to increase “willingness to pay” for the new DES device.\nNote:\nThis is largely a “launching a new product” case with a focus on pricing the new product. The case giver should actively walk the candidate through a set of qualitative and quantitative questions. The case giver should stick to the script of the case questions. To the effect that the candidate struggles, the case giver can assist the candidate to get back on track.\nThe candidate should be structured in answering qualitative questions and crunch through any numbers thrown his or her way, always keeping in mind how they tie back to the larger issues.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: add capacity, growth.\nConsulting Firm: Roland Berger Strategy Consultants first round job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: paper products; manufacturing.\nCase Interview Question #00590: Our client the Fedrigoni Group is an Italian paper production company headquartered in Verona, Italy. The company manufactures and distributes a wide range of fine quality, technically advanced paper and paper-related products. For instance, they make high-end glossy and matte paper that’s used in corporate brochures, magazine ads for Gucci and Prada, etc. So, their paper products can be considered a commodity.\nThe client Fedrigoni has one paper factory in Verona, Italy that produces 150,000 tons of paper a year. 90% of this production is sold into the Italian market, which gives it about a 20% market share. The other 10% is sold outside of Italy. The management of Fedrigoni Group would like to build another paper factory to  produce another 150,000 tons a year. This would cost them approximately $100 million. They would like us to advise them whether this is a good idea or not. How would go about analyzing this case?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to you if asked)\nThe Italian market for fine quality paper will continue to grow at about 10% annually. Germany is a very hot market also and growing at about 15% annually. Other Eastern European markets are growing as well.\nThe client Fedrigoni Group’s largest Italian competitor has 40% market share. An international competitor has 10% and  the other 30% is fragmented among many small players.\nThere are about 12 players and only 2 paper machine manufacturers in Europe. Everyone knows what everyone else is doing and nobody else is investing in additional capacity right now.\nSuggested Approach:\nThis case is asking the candidate to determine whether it makes sense to add additional capacity, i.e. can the client company be profitable in the future based on this investment? This will depend on the current and future market dynamics, which can be explored in a number of ways.\nHaving the 3C’s in your head will help you ask the right questions:\n\nCustomers: Who are they? Is there enough market demand for additional capacity?\nCompetitors: Who are they? Where are they? What market share do they have? How are their prices relative to ours? Can we capture any of their share?\nCompany: How much will this additional expansion cost the company, and what will the benefits be? Does this fit with the company’s current plans?\n\nKnowing the answers to these questions will then help you determine whether it makes sense to add capacity. You can also probe whether a new factory is the right way to go, or whether it might be more feasible and profitable to add capacity to the existing paper plant, acquire another company, etc.\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate: I’d like to understand a few things to evaluate this decision. First, I’d like to explore the current market demand for paper. Then, I’d like to understand the current players in the market and how our client company competes against them. Finally, I’d like to talk about the specifics of the investment proposed and what the NPV (net present value) might be for that option versus others.\nI’ll start with the market demand in Italy. You mentioned that the client has 20% market share, and it produces 150,000 tons of paper a year and 90% of this production is sold into the Italian market. So, the entire Italian market size is about 150,000 tons * 90% / 20% = 675,000 tons. What are the projected trends for Italian market growth?\nInterviewer: Well, how would you go about finding that out?\nCandidate: I might look at historical growth trends, but those are probably not that accurate because of the growth of the Internet. To get a more accurate picture of where the industry is going, I would interview the client’s customers, i.e. publishers, printers and ad agencies. I would ask them how they see their business prospects, what they are investing in now, what they want to invest in later, etc.\nInterviewer: OK, let’s assume that through this research, you discover that the Italian market will continue to grow at about 10% a year.\nCandidate: I see. How about the current players in this market? Do we know anything about their individual market share as well?\nInterviewer: Yes, we do. The client’s largest Italian competitor has 40% market share. An international competitor has 10% and the other 30% is fragmented among small players.\nCandidate: Interesting. So that means the Italian market could only absorb an additional 675,000 tons * 10% = 67,500 tons a year, not an additional 150,000 tons. It might make sense to look beyond Italy depending on the industry dynamics. What is the greater European market demand?\nInterviewer: Well, Germany is a very hot market and growing at about 15% annually. Other Eastern European markets are growing as well.\nCandidate: Great. Who are the major competitors in those markets and what kind of market share do they have?\nInterviewer: There are about 12 players and only 2 paper machine manufacturers in Europe. Everyone knows what everyone else is doing and nobody else is investing in additional capacity right now.\nCandidate: Are they not investing because they don’t see opportunity, or because they don’t have the resources?\nInterviewer: It’s not clear right now.\nCandidate: OK, turning to the investment angle, how quickly can we make back the money on the investment in the new paper plant?\nInterviewer: I don’t know the specifics, but it wouldn’t take very long. What would you advise, knowing what you know now?\nCandidate: While I don’t have all the information I would like, it seems that the European market could absorb the demand and since the competitors are not investing in additional capacity, this could be a great opportunity for the client to make inroads into a new market and increase revenues. Besides the new paper factory, they may also want to consider other growth options, such as building new capacity in the existing plant or maybe even acquiring a competitor.\nInterviewer: Great! You did a good job.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: improve profitability.\nConsulting Firm: IMS Health Consulting Group second round job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: healthcare: hospital & medical.\nCase Interview Question #00591: Your client is the CEO of The Methodist Hospital. Located in the Texas Medical Center in Houston, Texas, Methodist is one of the most comprehensive hospitals in the United States, with leading specialists in every field of medicine. The hospital has  earned worldwide recognition in multiple specialties including cardiovascular surgery, cancer and epilepsy treatment and organ transplantation.\nAs a large comprehensive hospital providing full range of services in a large urban area, the Methodist Hospital has done very well historically. In the last five years, however, the hospital’s profitability has decreased to the point that they are almost out of money and will not be able to meet their financial and social mission. The CEO comes to you to ask for advice. Specifically, he wants you to help address the following two questions:\n\nWhy has the hospital’s profitability gone down?\nHow should they turn it around and improve profitability?\n\nAdditional Information: (to be given to you if asked)\n1. The revenue scheme of The Methodist Hospital’s different services falls into the following three different categories:\n\n Fixed fee for service, e.g., a broken leg costs $1,200 to fix\n Cost plus: cost of providing the product/service plus a percentage\n Per diem fees: fee per day of hospital stay\n\n2. The hospital gains patients through physician referral. In other words, the physicians within the hospital see patients and after diagnosing those patients will refer the patients for care, treatment, surgery, testing, etc. to other places within the hospital.\n3. There are several patient / service segments in the hospital. The following are a few examples:\n\n Women in labor/ giving birth – low profitability, high referral rates / word of mouth, volume declining, fixed fee rate with high variability in length of stay\n Pediatrics – low profitability, high referral rates / word of mouth, volume declining, fixed fee rates\n Male adults (age 25-50) – medium profitability, medium referral rates, volume stable, Per diem and cost+ rates\n Elderly (65+) – high profitability, low referral rates, volume increasing, fixed fee rates\n\n4. Quantitative work in terms of cost:\n\n Fixed costs: $2,000 per patient\n Variable costs: $800 per patient per day\n Average length of patient stay: 10 days\n Patients seen per year: 10,000\n\nSuggested Approach:\nThis is a profitability case, so the candidate should plan to drill down on Revenues (price and quantity of patients or patients services at the hospital) and Costs (fixed costs and variable costs per patient).\nAlso, it is important for the candidate to ask about the economics of the case:\n\nHow does the hospital make money? – Paid in the revenues structures given by HMOs (health maintenance organization), insurers, and state agencies above. This is given upfront in the case description and is a bit of a red herring in the case.\nWho pays the costs? – Again, the costs are paid by the HMOs, insurers, and state agencies.\nHow do patients come into the hospital? – Patients come in through referral from the doctors that work in the hospital or through emergency services. This is helpful information to get in solving what is going on with revenues in the case. When one segments the products/ services in the hospital, one should think about patient/ service segments, or patient/ doctor segments.\n\nAfter receiving this additional information, the candidate should focus in on the following:\n\nHow many more people would the client be able to see if they reduced patient stays on average by 1 day?\nWhat would the effect on costs be for reducing patient stays by one day on average?\nHow would that affect the hospital’s profitability?\n\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate: This is a “improving profitability” case, and profits = revenues – costs. So, in terms of which side of the hospital’s profitability I’d like to start with, unless their costs have changed in some significant way because of a recent capital expenditure…?\nInterviewer: No, they’ve had no new costs.\nCandidate: Right, then I’d like to start with revenues and see if there have been any recent changes on the revenue side.\nInterviewer: Sure, that sounds like a good place to start.\nCandidate: So, revenues are composed of two things: price times quantity. Have the prices that the hospital charges for services that it provides changed recently?\nInterviewer: No, prices haven’t increased or decreased in any considerable way – other than general increases along with inflation.\nCandidate: Ok, so, it’s a problem with the number of patients, or number of services per patient, along different segments then.\nInterviewer: Yes, you’re right. What do you hypothesize is happening here?\nCandidate: I imagine that there are several patient, or service segments within the hospital.\nInterviewer: That’s right.\nCandidate: Is the hospital a full-service provider, or do they specialize in certain area, or service?\nInterviewer: Nope, the hospital is a full-service provider.\nCandidate: So, I hypothesize that more profitable and/or higher revenue generating patient/service segments are decreasing.\nInterviewer: Interesting. Actually there are 4 principal patient segments:\n1. Women in labor/ giving birth – low profitability, high referral rates or word of mouth, volume declining, fixed fee rate with high variability in length of stay\n2. Pediatrics – low profitability, high referral rates / word of mouth, volume declining, fixed fee rates\n3. Males (age 25-50) – medium profitability, medium referral rates, volume stable, Per diem and cost+ rates\n4. Elderly (65+) – high profitability, low referral rates, volume increasing, fixed fee rates\nSo, what do you think this data tells you?\nCandidate: Well, first, I would prioritize the segments in terms of how important they seem to our current inquiry: I would put the third segment aside because the volume has stayed stable, and I would concentrate on the first two segments for two reasons:\n\n Their volume has been declining;\n These segments reflect high word of mouth and long-term patient segments that are likely to keep coming back to the hospital for other services for a long time if they like the service that they get there.\n\nThis is as opposed to the elderly segment, which represents a diminishing group of patient/services because of their age.\nInterviewer: Good. And what would you want to do in order to reverse the decline of those two segments?\nCandidate: I would probably want to do some research into why those segments’ volume is declining. For instance:\n\n Has service quality declined?\n Have the number or quality of pediatricians or obstetricians at the hospital declined?\n Has another hospital in the area begun to specialize in pediatrics and obstetrics that is making the client’s patient and patient/service volume decrease in these specialties?\n\nInterviewer: Good, good. One last question: would you abandon the fourth segment (elderly) patients completely? They are a highly profitable segment. How would you deal with them?\nCandidate: They are a highly profitable segment, which is a bit strange, as they have a fixed fee rate revenue structure and their length of stay can vary tremendously. I would try to segment them further into patient or service segments that were a little more predictable along the dimension of how long they stay – this might yield a much more profitable and predictable patient/service type than what they currently have.\nInterviewer: Right, so there might be some 20% of those patients that are staying longer and driving down profitability for the rest?\nCandidate: Yes, and a more detailed segmentation might show that. So the client might be able to target and get the more profitable of those patients.\nInterviewer: Good, good. So, that pretty much covers the revenues side. Now, suppose that I told you that we went to the CEO of the hospital with all of this interesting info about revenues and revenue generation by targeting different segments, but the CEO said that they really thought it was about the number of patients that the hospital can see and the costs and cost controls. How would you think about costs?\nCandidate: Well, there are two components to costs: fixed costs and variable costs. Do we know fixed costs and variable costs by patient, or by patient/service type?\nInterviewer: Well, actually, we don’t have cost data by patient or by patient/service type, like we did in the revenues discussion. But we do have cost data per patient on average at the hospital.\nCandidate: So, aggregate data on a per patient level?\nInterviewer: Yes. We know that on average the fixed cost for admitting a patient is $2,000. And the cost per patient day is $800. The average length of a patient’s stay is 10 days. And the hospital sees 10,000 patients each year. The CEO is curious about how many more patients the hospital could see if they reduced the length of an average patient day by one day.\nCandidate: Well, currently they are seeing 10,000 patients annually. Each patient stays 10 days on average; so, the hospital has the capacity for 100,000 patient days annually (10,000 patients * 10 days = 100,000 patient days). If you reduced the stay to 9 days on average for each patient, then there would be an excess of 10,000 patient-days of capacity (100,000 patient-days – 90,000 patient-days). If each patient stays 9 days on average, then the hospital could see about 1,111 more patients each year (10,000 excess patient-days / 9 days = 1,111 patients).\nInterviewer: That’s right. Now, how much would costs decrease if they did this?\nCandidate: Well, currently, they see 10,000 patients per year for an average of 10 days each. Fixed costs for these patients are $2,000 * 10,000 patients, which equals $20,000,000. Variable costs are 100,000 patient days * $800 per day, which equals $80,000,000. So, their current costs are $100,000,000.\nIf they reduced the average patient stay by 1 day, then their variable costs change. They still have the same fixed costs of $20,000,000. But their variable costs have changed: they now have 90,000 patient days * $800 per day, which equals $72,000,000 in variable costs. That’s a cost savings of $8,000,000 each year.\nInterviewer: That’s right. So, how would you summarize these findings to the CEO and what recommendations would you make?\nCandidate: On the revenues side, the client Methodist Hospital is losing patients in a few segments that provide revenues long-term. For these segments, they need to re-target and bring in more doctors who “own” these patients and improve their brand in these service areas through promotions, thought leader excellence, or community activities that would raise their profile. And they should further segment other patient/service types (the elderly) in order to realize more profitable patient/service types within current segments.\nOn the costs side, the hospital could realize significant decreases in variable costs by trimming down patient days, by even a slight amount on a per patient basis. While this is where the numbers and quantitative analysis is more telling, Methodist Hospital has a social mission to be concerned with, as well as the financial mission that we’ve already discussed at length. Because the hospital needs to provide the best service and healthcare to its patients, it may not be able to cut down on patient days per patient (the costs side) while maintaining its social goal and mission. And for this reason, several quality of care analyses should be done before initiating some of the cost-cutting options that have been discussed here.\nInterviewer: Excellent! I think you did great. We can stop here for now. Do you have any questions for me?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: market entry, new market; private equity.\nConsulting Firm: Ernst & Young (EY) Advisory final round job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: automotive, motor vehicles; sports.\nCase Interview Question #00593: Our client CVC Capital Partners is a global private equity firm headquartered in London, United Kingdom. With approximately USD $46 billion in funds focused on management buyouts, CVC Capital has completed over 250 investments across a wide range of industries and countries. It has a network of eighteen offices throughout Europe, Asia and the United States.\nCVC Capital Partners has just purchased a motorcycle manufacturer based in Berlin, Germany that makes sporty bikes. Currently the motorcycle manufacturing company supplies motorcycles to Europe but has no presence in the United States. They are looking to expand the business into the U.S. market but are unsure of how to do this. They are considering two models: one is selling through existing dealerships in the U.S., the other is building a flagship dealership of their own and selling that way.\nOur client CVC Capital wants to consider a few issues. First, is this expansion into the U.S. a good idea? Second, which model would be the best to pursue? As a starting point, tell me a little bit about the high level pros and cons of building their own flagship dealership versus selling through existing channels.\nAdditional Information: (to be given to you if asked)\nFlagship Dealership:\n\n Retail Price: $20K per bike\n Cost: $10K per bike\n Cost to set up flagship dealership: $6 million\n\nExisting Channel:\n\n $500K start up cost\n Retail Price: $20K per bike\n Cost: $10K per bike\n The distributors require 33% gross margin, then there will be a 3% allowance of the sales price that will be reserved for return, selling costs, etc.\n\nPossible Answer:\nCandidate: I would think that opening their own flagship dealership would have a lot of pros. First, it would probably allow for higher margins as you would own the distribution. Second, you could train the sales people to sell the right way, position the product correctly, etc. You would also then control your customer data, ability to control marketing messages in the dealership, etc.\nOn the downside, there is the capital investment, the fact that existing dealerships have relationships with customers already in place, distribution channels already in place, and local market knowledge. Your brand name is also not well-known in the United States, so opening a flagship dealership might be difficult.\nInterviewer: OK, that makes sense. What would you think about the profitability?\nCandidate: I would assume that owning your own dealership would be more profitable in the long run, but short term it might be better to go with the existing channels because of the capital investment. Given that the client CVC Capital is a PE firm, they probably don’t want to invest a ton of capital or hold the motorcycle company for too long.\nInterviewer: That sounds good, now let me give you some numbers and let’s see if they match your hypothesis:\n\nFlagship Dealership:\n\n Retail Price: $20K per bike\n Cost: $10K per bike\n Cost to set up flagship dealership: $6 million\n\n\nExisting Channel:\n\n $500K start up cost\n Retail Price: $20K per bike\n Cost: $10K per bike\n The distributors require 33% gross margin, then there will be a 3% allowance of the sales price that will be reserved for return, selling costs, etc.\n\n\n\nSo, what’s the breakeven in both cases?\nCandidate: The breakeven in terms of a flagship store is 600 bikes [ $6 million / ($20K - $10K) = 600 bikes ]. For the distributor model, you assume a 33% gross margin, so 33% of 20K is 6.6K. That means we still get 13.3K. With a 3% allowance, that means we roughly take in 13K for every bike. That’s $3K profit. $500k / $3k is about 167 bikes.\nInterviewer: Right. What does that tell you?\nCandidate: That our breakeven is lower in the existing distributor model. It also tells me that in terms of investing in the long term the flagship would be much more profitable.\nInterviewer: So how conceivable are these numbers?\nCandidate: I would think selling 167 bikes should be fairly easy in a year. 600…it also sounds pretty reasonable.\nInterviewer: (Present the following chart to the candidate)\n\nNote: The chart shows all sorts of things but relevant info is that 100K bikes are sold in the US every year, and it’s broken down 3 ways. First by price, next by type, and thrid by country of origin. It turns out that 15% of bikes are from Europe, 30% are high end (priced $20K or higher), and roughly 10% are sporty bikes.\nNow what do you think?\nCandidate: (Takes some time to think) Alright, so now I know that 100K bikes are sold in the U.S. every year. About 15% or 15,000 of them come from Europe, 30% of those or 4.5K are high end bikes priced $20k or higher, and 10% of those are sporty bikes, or 450 bikes. So maybe 600 would be a stretch, and 167 might even be tough if there are strong competitors.\nInterviewer: I would argue that the country of origin doesn’t matter. A sporty $20K bike is a sporty $20K bike, right?\nCandidate: I’d actually disagree. Think about automobiles – some people buy German cars because they want to buy German cars, nothing else. Or think about beers. Some people only like Belgian beers for no reason except that they’re Belgian – it’s an image thing, right? (Note: This argument was not well received by the interviewer.)\nInterviewer: OK, there’s no right or wrong answer here. Assume that I’m right and the market is much bigger. Now what?\nCandidate: OK, then it seems feasible. So short term the better play is to use existing distribution centers that are already in place, but long term it would be best to build their own flagship dealership.\nInterviewer: And does the fact that it’s a PE client have any bearing here?\nCandidate: Well, they’ll want to turn it over quickly and not pour cash into it, so they’d likely go with existing distribution channels and not build new one. They also might want to examine why they’re thinking about the US market – maybe they can grow in other parts of Europe more efficiently and profitably.\nInterviewer: Great! Thank you.\nNote:\nWhile this is a market entry case, the candidate should keep in mind that the client CVC Capital Partners is a PE shop and wants to flip the purchased motorcycle company quickly. On a high level, the candidate will need to hit the numbers right when they’re presented and be able to step back and synthesize into some sort of meaningful recommendation. The interviewer should keep asking the candidate to summarize and back-up assumptions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new product.\nConsulting Firm: Bain & Company first round job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: aerospace & defense.\nCase Interview Question #00565: Our client Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN) is a major defense contractor for the United States government. Headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts, the company is an industrial corporation with core manufacturing concentrations in weapons, military, and commercial electronics. It was previously involved in corporate and special-mission aircraft until early 2007. Currently Raytheon is the world’s largest producer of guided missiles and the fifth largest defense contractor in the United States by revenue.\nThere has been a growing threat from regional terrorists who are shooting down commercial airplanes with rocket launchers. There is a potential solution to the problem: to equip commercial aircrafts with anti-missile defense systems, called IRCMs (infra-red counter measures). These devices defend against ground-to-air attacks. The United States Congress has approached our client requesting these systems  to be installed on commercial airplanes. Do you recommend they take the deal? Why or why not?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to you if asked)\n1. Market\n\nThere are about ~6,000 commercial airplanes in the U.S.\nAbout 50%, or ~3,000 airplanes are eligible for installation of the IRCM anti-missile defense systems.\nThe client Raytheon thinks they can capture 50% of the market (so 1,500 planes in total); there is another major competitor Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC) who would have the remaining half. This competitor also competes in the rest of our client’s product and service lines.\nU.S. government law says that that the government must use more than one provider (minimum) to maintain a “competitive market”. So, there will always be another competitor.\nThe market has seen stagnant growth over the past few years.\nAirlines have no problem with installing the anti-missile defense system, so this is not an issue.\n\n2. Product\n\nThe anti-missile defense system is installed beneath the airplane. It is a small device and installation is easy.\nThe device uses infra-red lasers to redirect the missile away from the plane, but the missile is then just sent in another random direction (The system can’t control where it goes, it can only ensure that the missile doesn’t hit the aircraft).\nThe U.S. government will pay $2 million per installation.\nThe anti-missile defense systems need re-installation every 10 years.\n\n3. Company\n\nThe client’s current total revenue is USD $15 billion.\nVariable cost per system is USD $1.75 million.\nAnnual fixed costs: $250 million for factory & manufacturing, $250 million for management and employees, and $250 million in R&D.\n\nPossible Answer:\nThis case focuses on the profitability of the new anti-missile defense system. Selling to Congress means losing money, but there is also a huge opportunity to go overseas. That opportunity may make it worth taking the deal.\nThere is also a major strategic threat: the major competitor will have 50% of the market. What if the competitor doesn’t accept the job (then our client gets the entire market)? What if competitor moves overseas?\n1. Market Opportunity\n6,000 planes * 50% (are eligible) * 50% (client’s market share) = 1,500 planes\n$2 million per installation fee means $2 million * 1,500 = $3 billion opportunity\n2. Profits\nRevenue: $3,000 million\nVariable costs: $1.75 million * 1,500 = $2,625 million\nGross margin: $3,000 – $2,625 = $375 million\nTotal fixed costs: $250 + $250 + $250 = $750 million\nProfits: $375 – $750 = -$375 million\nSo, taking the deal will not be profitable, but there may be other opportunities.\n3. Opportunities\nExpand geographically: what other governments would be interested? (Fixed costs stay the same if the client expands internationally, so marginal profit can turn into positive.)\n\nOnes with many commercial flights over terrorist areas\nMiddle East and Southern Asia\n\nWhat are the criteria in selecting governments to sell the system to? Any governments NOT willing to sell to?\n\nIf they can pay (can they afford it?)\nType of government (is it democratic?)\nLevel of corruption in the government\nCompetitors in the new market\nPR issues\n\n4. Final Recommendation\nThe client Raytheon Company should start in the U.S. market, then expand into other countries. However, the client should also consider potential risks associated with the deal, such as:\n\nWhat if competitor does the same?\nWhat if we don’t sell in U.S., how will appear to other areas of the business?\nPolitical: what if government changes its mind?\nInternal: do we have the capacity for immediate production and installation of 1,500 systems?\nWho takes responsibility for the missile after it is diverted from the commercial airplane? What if people on the ground are killed? (Ethical and PR issue.)\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Headquartered in McLean, Virginia, USA, Mars, Inc. produces confectionery, pet food, and other food products with USD $30 billion in annual sales in 2010. The company is entirely owned by the Mars family and is ranked as the 5th largest privately held company in the United States by Forbes Magazine.\nMars Petcare competes in the $16 billion United States pet food market. Currently they have four products segments: dry food for dogs, wet food for dogs, dry food for cats, and wet food for cats. Recently the Chief Marketing Officer of Mars Petcare US is considering a $10 million marketing campaign for one of their pet food segments. Which of the four segments do you recommend? And why?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate if asked)\n1. Pet Food Industry\n\n There are 50% cats, 50% dogs in the US pet market\n There are more dog owners in the US, but cat owners tend to own many more cats, so the total number of each animal is approximately the same\n On average, a dog weighs twice as much as a cat (or is twice as large)\n Food consumed by a pet, either a dog or a cat, is proportional to its weight\n\n2. Product\n\n Pet foods have the same inputs: general processed meats\n Each kind of pet food can sells for the same price\n\n\n3. Exhibit 1: Campaign Estimates by Segment (provide only if asked)\n\n\n\n\nDry dog\nWet dog\nDry cat\nWet cat\n\n\nMarket size\n$7.5 billion\n$2.5 billion\n$4.0 billion\n$2.0 billion\n\n\nMars Petcare market share\n30%\n40%\n10%\n5%\n\n\nCompetitor’s market share\n30%\n10%\n30%\n40%\n\n\nMars Petcare profit margin\n12%\n18%\n5%\n10%\n\n\nExpected market share increase from the $10 milion marketing campaign\n+1%\n+2%\n+4%\n+5%\n\n\n\nPossible Answer:\nThe candidate should identify size of each market and then evaluate the profitability of each segment. The dog market is twice the size as cat, but the estimated increase in profitability from wet cat is the largest. However, after calculations, the profits increase from wet cat are $10 million (in first year) and cost of the marketing campaign is also $10 million, so essentially not making any money. The client company may have better options / investments for the $10 million.\n1. Market\nDrivers of market demand: the number of pets, the number of meals per day, the size of each meal\nEstimate division of market between cat and dog, for example: divide by size or by weight\nSince a dog weighs twice as much as a cat, and needs to consume twice as much food as a cat, the $16 billion market means $5.33 is cat and $10.67 is dog, thus dog foods may be more desirable to target.\n2. Calculations based on Exhibit 2\n\n\n\n\nDry dog\nWet dog\nDry cat\nWet cat\n\n\nNew market share\n30% + 1% = 31%\n40% + 2% = 42%\n10% + 4% = 14%\n5% + 5% = 10%\n\n\nNew total revenue\n$7.5 billion * 31% = $2,325 milion\n$2.5 billion * 42% = $1,050 milion\n$4.0 billion * 14% = $560 milion\n$2.0 billion * 10% = $200 milion\n\n\nMarginal revenue\n$7.5 billion * 1% = $75 milion\n$2.5 billion * 2% = $50 milion\n$4.0 billion * 4% = $160 milion\n$2.0 billion * 5% = $100 milion\n\n\nMarginal profit\n$75 million * 12% = $9 milion\n$50 million * 18% = $9 milion\n$160 million * 5% = $8 milion\n$100 million * 10% = $10 milion\n\n\n\nFrom initial calculations, it seems wet cat segment is the most profitable one. However, considering the $10 milion cost of the marketing campaign, the expected value of the campaign is $0. Now ask the candidate:\n\nIs it still worth doing the marketing project?\nWhat if profit margin for dry cat goes to 10% and for wet cat goes to 20% (doubling both profit margins), what is the new profitability?\nDoes your recommendation change?\n\n3. Final Recommendation\nWet cat is the best segment to go. However, before we proceed with the marketing campaign, we need to question some of the assumptions made in the above analysis: what if the marketing campaign costs more? What if it’s more or less effective?\nGiven that the marketing campaign may not actually bring any tangible benefits to client, the $10 million can be better spent in other ways, for example:\n\n Make food for different animals\n Expand outside of the U.S. market\n Vertically integrate\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Analysis\nFrom Exhibit 1: Revenue Breakdown\nQuestion: Why does a New York City-based major law firm office have such a low revenue from financial services industry?\nFrom Exhibit 2: Operating Costs\nTotal operating costs rising dramatically: 25% this year, 43% next year.\nMain cost increase are from:\n\n personnel: 30% increase this year, 50% next year\n taxes: 25% increase this year, 40% next year\n sales and marketing: 5% increase this year, 5% next year\n general & administrative: 5% increase this year, 5% next year\n\nFrom Exhibit 3: Employees By Industry\nThe percentage of employees receiving year-end bonus provides little insight.\nThe client’s lawyers working very short workweeks:\n\n Total revenue divided by total number of employees = $46 million / 77 = ~$600K revenue per employee\n Revenue per employee ($600K) divided by rate of $300 per hour means ~2,000 hours per year, or ~38 hours per week\n\nFrom Exhibit 4: Billable Hours\nFinancial services billable hours are dropping dramatically\nIndustry mix is not changing, except for financial services\n2. Conclusions\nIn general, law firms earn revenue by paying employees (lawyers) a fixed wage per hour (plus a discretionary year-end bonus), then bill clients at a higher rate. Thus, the most important costs relate to personnel expenses. This case is about boosting profits. From the above analysis, the client company’s New York office faces several problems:\n\n First, being a New York City office of a highly reputable law firm, it has an oddly low revenue share from financial services clients.\n Second, it has been paying increasingly large bonuses (part of the personnel expense).\n Third, these bonuses may not be justified, as billable hours have held constant in three of the industries and are falling in financial services.\n Fourth, the lawyers are working only 38 hours on average per week – this is extremely low for a major reputable law firm.\n\nPotential recommendations to above problems:\n\n grow revenue among financial services companies;\n switch lawyer’s pay from bonus to per-hour;\n encourage more working hours per employee;\n lower prices for financial services companies;\n consider more effective marketing programs (marketing cost rising by 5%, but revenue is falling).\n\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new business.\nConsulting Firm: Booz & Company first round job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: sports, leisure & recreation.\nCase Interview Question #00567: Rio de Janeiro, commonly referred to simply as Rio, is the capital city of the State of Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city of Brazil, and the third largest metropolitan area and agglomeration in South America, boasting approximately 6.3 million people within the city proper, making it the 6th largest in the Americas, and 26th largest in the world.\nRecently the City of Rio de Janeiro is considering placing a bid to host the upcoming 2016 Summer Olympic Games. Our client, the Rio Olympics bidding committee, approached us to ask for our opinion of what the major considerations should be. Of major concern is how to convince the State of Rio de Janeiro and the Brazilian government that this would be beneficial not only for the city but also for Brazil. How would you recommend they go about doing this?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to you if asked)\nThe 2016 Summer Olympics are to be held over 15 days.\nCosts: (give all the costs at once)\n\n $2.8 billion for the operation of the games (opening ceremony, security, athlete support, transportation, closing ceremony, etc.)\n $2.6 billion for freeway upgrades\n $6.0 billion for new and upgrading venues\n $2.5 billion for new airport terminal\n $1.1 billion for athlete facilities\n\nRevenues: (ask what the candidates think Olympics revenue streams could be, and then give out one at a time) \n\n International Olympic Committee (IOC) support: $1.1 billion\n Tickets Sales: Give Exhibit 1\n Sponsorship: $75 per seat (per occupied seat*).\n TV broadcasting rights: combined with the preceding 2014 Winter Olympic Games, TV stations pay $15 billion, and the Summer Olympic Games is expected to take 80% of this. Of this total, 25% will go to the organizing committee and the hosting city.\n\n* Do not say occupied seat, unless the candidate asks if this is the case. If this comes after the Ticketing section, then tell the candidate that he / she has omitted thinking about seating occupancy, and ask how this would affect the numbers.\nExhibit 1: Seating for Rio 2016 Summer Olympic Games\n\n\n\nSeating Type\nPrice Per Ticket\nTotal Number of Seats Per Day\n\n\nA\n$200\n420,000\n\n\nB\n$120\n700,000\n\n\n\nPossible Solution:\nThis “launching a new business” type of case is designed to test the candidate’s ability to generate a framework outside of what they might be accustomed to; there is no market, no competition, a very unusual product. The case is designed to initially revolve around profitability, which will show a great deficit. At this point, the interviewer should ask if hosting the games is a bad idea. If the candidate says that it is, then the case can turn into a brainstorming session on how the Rio bidding committee might convince the government that it is a good idea after all. Let the candidate float around with some questions, before hinting that we should be looking at this from a profitability angle.\nCost-Benefit Calculations\nTotal Costs = $2.8 + $2.6 + $6.0 + $2.5 + $1.1 = $15.0 billion\nRevenues from ticket sales:\n\n\n\nSeating type\nPrice per ticket\nTotal # of seats per day\nExpected occupancy**\nTotal occupied seating (for 15 days)\nTotal revenues (for 15 days)\n\n\nA\n$200\n420,000\n95%\n420,000 * 95% * 15 = 5,985,000 ~= 6.0 million*\n$200 * 6 million = $1.2 billion\n\n\nB\n$120\n700,000\n60%\n700,000 * 60% * 15 = 6,300,000 = 6.3 million\n$120 * 6.3 million = $0.756 billion\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n12.3 million\n~$2.0 billion*\n\n\n\n* allow approximation when moving forward with further calculations\n** Provide “expected occupancy rate” only if asked, but allow candidate to complete workings without this first, and then ask what assumptions have been made. If the candidate doesn’t think of this, provide the numbers.\nRevenues from sponsorship: $75 per seat * 12.3 million = $922 million ~= $0.9 billion\nRevenues from TV broadcasting rights: $15 billion * 80% * 25% = $3.0 billion\nTotal Revenues: $1.1 + $2.0 + $0.9 + $3.0 = $7.0 billion\nProfits = Revenues ($7.0 B) – Costs ($15.0 B) = -$8.0 billion\nNow, ask the candidate if this makes the bid a bad idea. Regardless of the answer, ask how that gap (-$8.0 billion) could be closed. Possible answers include: official merchandise, tolls on new freeways, increasing seat price, increasing seating capacity through marketing, utilizing semi-temporary venues and facilities, upgrading existing facilities instead of building new facilities, etc.\nAfter debating, concede that the gap might be narrowed to a $6 billion deficit. Now, ask the candidate if bidding for the 2016 Summer Olympics is still a bad idea.\nExplain that historically, an Olympic Games rarely shows a direct profit for the host city, however, indirectly it has been shown that an Olympic Games can be hugely beneficial for a host city and host country, both fiscally and emotionally. Ask how this could be the case.\nArguments that could be made to the Brazilian government that hosting the Olympics could be a good thing:\n\nTourism during and after the games would increase significantly, reducing, and perhaps offsetting, the profitability deficit.\nUpgrading city infrastructure (e.g. airports, sports facilities, etc) is beneficial.\nSense of pride throughout the city and the country – good for everyone living there.\nIf selected, Rio will be the first South American city to host the event.\n\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Organic foods are foods that are produced using methods that do not involve modern synthetic inputs such as synthetic pesticides and chemical fertilizers. Organic foods are not processed using irradiation, industrial solvents, or chemical food additives.\nCurrently, the client sells only raw vegetables, fruits and some produces. Recently, the manager of The Real Food Company has seen the success national grocery chains (Whole Foods Market, Kroger, Costco, Walmart, Safeway, etc) have had with prepared food offerings and they are looking to duplicate that success. They are looking to us to help them decide which of the following three options to pursue:\n\nOption 1: Pre-made food. Our client will buy a custom cooler and have employees produce and wrap a number of sandwiches every morning before the store opens.\nOption 2: Full Service Counter. Our client will build a full size deli counter and staff it throughout the day with employees who will make sandwiches to order.\nOption 3: Partnership. Our client will partner with an outside chain (e.g. Subway, Quiznos) and install a mini-restaurant in the front of the store.\n\nWhat would you recommend and why?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to you if asked)\n1.

The “Profits = Revenues – Costs” framework will be a useful element. The challenge is to maintain a clear and consistent framework throughout multiple calculations that include fixed and variable numbers.\nThe candidate should be pushed to identify revenue, fixed and variable costs and to identify the different categories. Good answers identify the basics of labor, food / materials and overhead. Better answers identify the opportunity cost of losing floor space and the new grocery revenues gained through increased customer traffic.\nCalculations\n\n\n\n\nOption 1: Pre-Made/Cooler\nOption 2: Full Service Counter\nOption 3: Full Service Partnership\n\n\nTotal Revenue\n\n\n\n\n\nMeal revenue = (% buying meals * total customers * meal price * client share)\n5% * 2,000 * $5 * 100% = $500\n10% * (2,000 + 20) * $10 * 100% = $2,020\n10% * (2,000 + 40) * $10 * 20% = $408\n\n\nConsumer effect revenue = (Consumer effect * average total purchase)\n$0\n1% * 2,000 * $100 = $2,000\n2% * 2,000 * $100 = $4,000\n\n\nTotal Revenue / day\n$500\n$4,020\n$4,408\n\n\nTotal Cost\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable cost – overhead\n$3\n$2,020 * 10% = $202\n$2,040 * 10% = $204\n\n\nVariable cost – materials / food\n30% * $500 = $150\n30% * $2,020 = $606\n$0\n\n\nFixed cost – opportunity\n$0\n$1,000\n$3,000\n\n\nFixed cost – labor\n$40\n$300\n$0\n\n\nTotal Costs / day\n$150 + $40 + $3 =$193\n$202 + $606+ $1,000 + $300 = $2,108\n$204 + $3,000 = $3,204\n\n\nProfit / day\n$500 – $193 = $307\n$4,020 – $2,108 = $1,912\n$4,408 – $3,204 = $1,202\n\n\nProfit Margins\n$307 / $500 = 61%\n$1,912/ $4,020 = 48%\n$1,202 / $4,408 = 27%\n\n\nPayback Period\n$30,000 / 307 = 98 days\n$500,000 / $1,912 = 262 days\n$250,000 / $1,202 = 208 days\n\n\n\nNote: estimates are sufficient for payback period ($30,000 / $300 = 100 days, $500,000 / $2,000 = 250 days, and $250,000 / $1,250 = 200 days).\nThe key takeaway of the case is that Option 2 is the best option and it falls within the expected payback period of 1 year.\n\n Option 1 has the highest profit margins, but simply does not have enough volume\n Option 3 is not as profitable despite the increased customer effect revenue\n\nCase specific talking points:\n\n Option 3 cost structure can insulate the company in poor economies (no employees to maintain, immune to food costs since food comes from the retailer)\n Option 1 is easy to start or stop in times of demand\n\nIf time permits, a secondary goal of the case is to identify key issues surrounding the different options. Creativity is recommended. Some possible talking points include:\n\n Competition – How will other local/national chains react, how will local fast food restaurants react?\n Joint promotion – Can prepared food be used to drive more sales in other grocery products (e.g. coupons for a meal and a bottle of soda, or including a particular brand of chips with a meal)\n Centralized prep / distribution – partnering with other local stores could drastically reduce pre-made food costs\n Operations improvement with food inventory – can unsightly, but safe fruits/vegetables be used?\n If we encounter unexpected drops or expansions in demand, how quickly can different options adapt?\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: estimate, guesstimate.\nConsulting Firm: PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Advisory first round job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: food and beverages.\nCase Interview Question #00579: How many gallons of ice cream are sold in the United States each year?\nPossible Solution:\nTo answer this kind of estimation or guesstimate cases, the candidate can either work from the supply side, or work from the demand side, or from both.\nTo estimate the amount of ice cream sold in the U.S. from the supply side, the following sub-questions can be used:\n\nWhere is ice cream sold in the U.S.?\nFor different types of places that sell ice cream, how many stores are in each type?\nFor each type of stores that sell  ice cream, what is their average daily sales volume?\n\nFrom the demand side, we can ask the following questions to help us figure out the total annual demand for ice cream in the U.S.:\n\n How many people in the U.S. will buy ice cream?\n For different groups of people that buy ice cream, how many people are in each group?\n For different groups of people that buy ice cream, how often do they buy ice cream and what is the average amount they buy?\n\nThe approach presented here is a combination of working from supply and from demand sides.\nFirst of all, ask yourself: where can people buy ice cream? In the United States, usually ice cream can be sold through retailers and restaurants.\nFirst, let’s analyze the retail sales. This category include various ice cream shops, ice cream parlors, ice cream stands, and grocery stores that sell ice cream.\nAssume that of the 300 million people in the US, 80% like to eat ice cream. That makes 240 million possible consumers. Ice cream sales are likely to be somewhat seasonal, especially in Northern States, so assume an average selling season of eight months in the North and ten months in the South, for an average of nine months for the whole country. During the season, assume that people buy and eat ice cream twice a month, and assume that the average serving is one pint. Since there are eight pints in a gallon, retail sales will be: 240 million people * 9 months per year * 2 servings per month * 1 pint / 8 pints per gallon = 540 million gallons.\nThen, restaurant sales of ice cream.\nAssume that 80% of the US population frequents restaurants, and that they do so at a pace of twice per month on average. That makes 300 million people * 80% * 12 months per year * 2 visits per month = 5,760 million restaurant visits per year. Assume that 50% of these restaurants offer ice cream. That makes 5,760 million * 50% = 2,880 million possible purchases. Now assume that one out of ten times, the customer will order ice cream. That adds up to 2,880 million * 10% = 288 million purchases. Now assume that the average serving of ice cream in a restaurant is half a pint, then the total restaurant purchases come out to be: 288 million purchases * 0.5 pint per serving / 8 pints per gallon = 18 million gallons.\nTherefore, total purchases of ice cream are 540 million + 18 million = 558 million gallons per year.\nSanity Check: We can do a quick sanity check by dividing this number 558 million gallons by 300 million people, which means that the average annual ice cream consumption is 558/300 or a little less than 2 gallons per head of the population. That seems to be reasonable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new business.\nConsulting Firm: Booz & Company final round job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: automotive, motor vehicles.\nCase Interview Question #00583: AAA (Triple A, formerly known as the American Automobile Association) is a federation of 51 independently operated motor clubs throughout North America. AAA is a not-for-profit member service organization with more than 51 million members. AAA provides services to its members such as  travel, automotive, insurance, financial, and discounts. Its national headquarters are in Heathrow, Florida.\nOur client in this case is Chicago Motor Club, one of the 51 AAA motor clubs. The Chicago Motor Club primarily provides emergency roadside assistance services to its members. These services include jump starting an automobile, towing a vehicle, helping to change a flat tire, providing a small amount of fuel when a vehicle  runs out of it, pulling out a vehicle that is stuck in snow or helping people who are locked out of their cars. The club members pay a yearly $50 subscription fee regardless of the number of service requests they make every year.\nA typical scenario is that a person has trouble starting the car and calls the AAA service center. The AAA service center then sends the nearest service van to the member. The mechanic will then try to resolve the minor defect. In case the car needs serious repair, the service van will tow it to the nearest official dealer or repair shop where our member can have the car repaired. Internal statistics indicate that the average time before a service person reaches the client is 25 minutes in the greater Chicago metropolitan area. On average the defect is resolved within 12 minutes.\nA recent customer satisfaction survey revealed that 85% of the Chicago Motor Club AAA members are happy with the service. Remarkably, 20% of the members indicated that they would be willing to pay up to 10 times the current price if they were sure to have a service mechanic to help them within 30 minutes.\nWith this data, our client, the president of Chicago Motor Club, asked us to determine whether they should start a new service for the 20% of the members (called premium) that are willing to pay more. What would you recommend?\nAdditional Information: \n1. If he or she doesn’t completely understand, the candidate should first ask what the provided service exactly is.\nAnother Example: On a winter day an AAA member wants to go somewhere and it turns out that his car won’t start because the battery is empty. The member calls our service line and logs a request. Upon that request the nearest available service van is sent. The service mechanic will help the member to get the car started and so the battery recharges.\nOur service only helps members out with small defects and will not replace parts. In case of big failure our service will bring the car to the nearest official car service station (e.g. Ford) or repair shop where he can have it repaired.\n2. How is our client company organized?\nOur client the Chicago Motor Club has several service vans across the Chicago metropolitan area that can be called up. The number of vans in a certain area is a complex function of the member population, the number of historical problems in this area, accessibility, etc.\nPossible Solutions:\nThis is a “whether to start a new business or not” case that requires a thorough problem analysis and creativity to generate solutions. The case giver (or interviewer) should try to question all generated solutions and it is good to be tough and see how the candidate reacts and stays calm while his or her ideas get bombed. The case may not progress in the same sequence as given below and the case giver should be prepared for that.\nTo test the creativity: If the candidate asks for any additional information, don’t give the information immediately but ask: What do you expect it to be? – or – What do you think? This pushes the candidate to drive the case and be creative.\n1. Suggested Approach\nThe framework for this case could contain the following:\nCustomer Demand\n\nCustomer preferences: Why do they want to pay more?\nCustomer segmentation: Who are the people that want to pay more?\nPrice Sensitivity: Can we scale up the price sensitive customers to the new service?\n\nCompany\n\nHow does the company (Chicago Motor Club) currently operate? How is it structured?\nWhat are the changes to the processes to offer the new premium service?\nBenefits for providing the new service (Revenue improvements -> $/Minute increase)\nCosts for implementing the new service\n\n Pay more to the service mechanics\n Opportunity cost of not able to deliver the service for non-premium customers\n\n\n\nCompetition\n\nNumber of competitors providing similar premium service.\nAny sustainable advantage in creating this new service so that competition cannot provide this service in the future.\n\nMarketing Tactics/Next Steps\n\nWhat should be the pricing strategy for this new service\nPromotional or Advertising activities\nCan we provide this service to non-premium customers on a usage basis?\n\n2. First, ask the candidate what he/she thinks are the demand drivers.\nPossible Answer:\nThere are two main demand drivers:\n\nSeasonality:\n\n more service demand in winter than in summer\n It also depends on the weather\n\n\nRush hours:\n\n Service request peak period between 6am and 9am, then requests slow down during the day, then rise again between 5pm and 8pm.\n\n\n\n3. What members want to pay more for the service? Why? (If the candidate asks this question let him/her brainstorm by asking the question: who do you think these members are?)\nPossible Answer:\n\nProfessionals that need to be somewhere on time (meeting in the office, job interviews, airplane to catch, etc.)\nMothers with children (have you been waiting 1 hour in the cold with 3 children that have to go to school?)\n\n4. The interviewer (the case giver) should then push the candidate to think about the following: What is these people’s real issue, besides that the car doesn’t work?\nPossible Answer: They need to be at another location in time!!\n5. How can you solve this problem?\nPossible Answer:\nMost likely the candidate will come up with one or more of the three following answers:\nI. Increase overall service of the network so 90% of the calls get treatment in under 30 minutes. This is good; however what are the practical implications?\n\n More service vans\n The costs of more service vans will directly impact the bottom line of our client. That is not wanted.\n Will the member that are willing to pay $500, still pay $500 if everyone enjoys the better service?\n Can you assure in-time service delivery for all “premium” members?\n\nII. Prioritize members\n\n How do you do this practically?\n Can you assure service deliver? (what happens if all service vans are unavailable because they are working at a member?)\n What is the impact on the service level of the existing members? Will they be happy with lower quality service?\n\nIII. Build a new network for the speedy service\n\n But can you assure the service?\n What is the cost of building a whole new network? You loose synergies with the existing infrastructure.\n\n6. If the candidate analyses the situation thoroughly, he or she understands that the main need of the premium members is having transportation to the destination. So, how do you provide transportation and repair? (again a creativity solution)\nPossible Answer:\nThe solution could be: a premium member calls in. A repair person is sent if immediately available, else a taxi is sent that makes your transportation and takes your keys. The keys are dropped off at a local service station or repair shop and during the day a service person will repair your car or bring to the brand service station that does major repairs. (you can go into details of how this would work in practice)\nAdditional advantage of this solution:\n\nThis solution lowers the workload in the morning and can shift work for current service vans to the afternoon.\nAs a big consumer, the client company AAA will be able to negotiate good deals for taxi rides.\n\n7. Now, let’s do some estimation on how the new service will impact our client company.\nPossible Answer:\nThe candidate should now ask for the following information to proceed with the calculations. The interviewer should not give any information unless asked for.\nAdditional Information:\n\nBy introducing this new service our client’s operating costs will double.\nAssume that our client currently has a million customers and only 10% of our customer base will actually register for this new premium service.\n\nCandidate should be able to put together the following table:\n\n\n\nRevenues before starting the new service (should be estimated by the candidate)\n1 million * $50/year = $50 million\nRevenues after starting the new service (should be estimated by the candidate)\n900,000 * $50/year + 100,000 * $500/year = $95 million\n\n\nOperating expenses before starting the new service (Give to the candidate when asked for)\n$35 million\nOperating expenses with the new service (should be estimated by the candidate)\n$70 million\n\n\nProfits before starting the new service (should be estimated by candidate)\n$15 million\nProfits with the new service (should be estimated by the candidate)\n$25 million\n\n\n\n8. Wrap up: Ask the candidate to summarize his/her findings and make a final recommendation.\nPossible Answer:\nA potential service for the members is to guarantee them transportation and that their car will be taken care of. A taxi-service combined with the repair service gives premium members a solution that fits their needs. Based on the data analysis the potential service for the members is economically profitable for the client.\nThe recommendation must answer the question of the member. A great candidate says what the client company should do next and how we could help them.\n9. Note to Interviewer\nThings to look for in this case:\n\nThe framework must be simple and not too detailed.\nA good candidate drives the case and regularly says what he is thinking about and where he wants to go. If he doesn’t, ask regularly what he is thinking of, and where he wants to go.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: math problem.\nConsulting Firm: Bridgespan Group final round job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: government & public sector.\nCase Interview Question #00582: Ethiopia, officially known as the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, is a developing country located in the Horn of Africa. With more than 84 million inhabitants, Ethiopia is the second-most populous nation on the African continent, and the tenth largest by area, occupying 1,100,000 square kilometers.\nYour Client is the Minister of Public Health and Safety of Ethiopia. The minister has asked you to help determine the best way to allocate the Ministry’s available funds. The health ministry has sufficient funds to reduce death from any one and only one of the three following causes by 5% (each costs the same):\n1. Infant mortality due to malaria (malaria kills 10% of children under the age of 5)\n2. Adult Mortality due to injuries (half of all citizens who make it to age 5 die before reaching their 60th birthday at an average age of 30 years; of those, 10% die from injuries)\n3. Senior mortality due to infections (of those who survive to age 60, 40% die from infections and 60% die of natural causes)\nFor the sake of this case, assume that malaria effects only infants, injuries effect only adults between 5 and 60, and infections effect only seniors. What are an Ethiopian citizen’s chances of dying from each of these three causes? What are the “life years” lost from each cause? What cause of death do you recommend the Minister of Public Health address?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to you if asked) \nExhibit 1: Life Expectancies and Ages\n\nLife expectancy at birth is 48 years\nThe average victim of malaria is 2 years old\nThe average victim of injuries is 30 years old\nThe average victim of infections is 70 years old\nThe average victim of natural causes death is 80 years old\n\nPossible Solution:\nGood organization and structure is essential in this quantitative case. The math gets very complicated, and so allow simplifications (simple rounding won’t change the final answer by a lot). Also, if the candidate cannot do all of the calculations or steps, just ask what sort of analysis he or she would do with more time. The candidate should take the following steps:\n\nSet up the death rates issue tree as provided in the prompt.\nHowever, this does not address life expectancy. The candidate needs the life expectancy and / or age at each node of the issue tree. So, the interviewer should provide Exhibit 1 upon request.\nThen, the candidate should be asked to evaluate how each cause of death affects the “life years”. These calculations are shown for each cause of death:\nmalaria, injuries, then infections.\nLastly, the candidate should compare the final numbers and make a moral judgment about what he / she values most.\n\n1. Diagram of Death Rates\nThis diagram (an issue tree) below calculates the death rates from the three causes of death in the prompt: childhood malaria, adult injuries, and senior infections.\nOf every 100 people born:\n\n10% die from malaria before they reach 5: 10 people\n90% live: 90 people. Of the 90 people who make it to age 5:\n\n 50% die before reaching their 60: 90 * 50% = 45 people. Of these 45 people:\n\n 10% die from injuries: 45 * 10% = 4.5 people\n 90% die from other cause: 45 * 90% = 40.5 people\n\n\n 50% live to age 60: 90 * 50% = 45 people. Of these 45 people:\n\n 40% die from infections: 45 * 40% = 18 people\n 60% die of natural causes: 45 * 60% = 27 people\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, each citizen’s chances of dying from each of these three causes are:\n\n Malaria in childhood = 10/100 = 10%\n Injuries between ages 5 and 60 = 4.5/100 = 4.5%\n Infections after age 60 = 18/100 = 18%\n\n2. Calculate Life Expectancy\nNow the candidate can calculate the total life expectancy. But, ask the candidate which cause of death leads to the greatest loss of “life years”.\nOf every 100 people born:\n\n10% die from malaria before they reach 5: 10 people. Their average age = 2\n90% live: 90 people. Of the 90 people who make it to age 5:\n\n 50% die before reaching their 60: 90 * 50% = 45 people. Their average age = 30.\n 50% live to age 60: 90 * 50% = 45 people. Of these 45 people:\n\n 40% die from infections: 45 * 40% = 18 people. Their average age = 70.\n 60% die of natural causes: 45 * 60% = 27 people. Their average age = 80.\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, we have the following data to calculate life expectancy:\n\n\n\nAge\nPercent\n\n\n2\n10%\n\n\n30\n45%\n\n\n70\n18%\n\n\n80\n27%\n\n\n\nWeighted average: 2 * 10% + 30 * 45% + 70 * 18% + 80 * 27% = 47.9\n3. Calculate “Life Years” Loss From Malaria\nCalculate the number of “life years” lost by each cause of death. To do this, calculate the life expectancy by removing one cause of death to see its effect on the life expectancy. Then, combine the original life expectancy and the new life expectancy, weighting each by the number of lives.\nSo, of every 100 people born:\n\n0% die from malaria before they reach 5.\n100% live: 100 people. Of the 100 people who make it to age 5:\n\n 50% die before reaching their 60: 100 * 50% = 50 people. Their average age = 30.\n 50% live to age 60: 100 * 50% = 50 people. Of these 50 people:\n\n40% die from infections: 50 * 40% = 20 people. Their average age = 70.\n60% die of natural causes: 50 * 60% = 30 people. Their average age = 80.\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, we have the following data to calculate life expectancy without malaria:\n\n\n\nAge\nPercent\n\n\n2\n0%\n\n\n30\n50%\n\n\n70\n20%\n\n\n80\n30%\n\n\n\nWeighted average: 30 * 50% + 70 * 20% + 80 * 30% = 53.0\nThis is a gain of 53.0 – 47.9 = 5.1 years.\nAnother way to interpret the 5.1 years: Remember that malaria kills 10% of the population at age 2, rather than at age 53, and so each malaria death means a loss of 51 expected years. Thus, the total expected loss of “Life Years” from malaria = 51 * 10% = 5.1 years.\n4. Calculate “Life Years” Loss From Injuries\nDo the same step as was done for malaria, but now for injuries. Previously, 4.5 people died from injuries, but now they live, and so they move from the “die from injuries” to “die from other causes, or die from infections, or natural causes”. These 4.5 people should be distributed to the other three categories according to their previous chances.\nSo, of every 100 people born:\n\n10% die from malaria before they reach 5 years old: 10 people. Their average age = 2\n90% live: 90 people. Of the 90 people who make it to age 5:\n\n 50% die before reaching their 60: 90 * 50% = 45 people. Of these 45 people:\n\nPreviously, 10% die from injuries: 45 * 10% = 4.5 people. Now, 0% die from injuries. These 4.5 people either die from other cause, or die from infections, or die of natural causes. The 4.5 people who no longer die of injuries need to be distributed to the other three outcomes:\n\n(40.5 / 40.5 + 45) * 4.5 = ~2.0 to “other cause”\n (18 / 40.5 + 45) * 4.5 = ~1.0 to “infections”\n (27 / 40.5 + 45) * 4.5 = ~1.5 to “natural causes”\n\n\nPreviously, 90%, or 40.5 people die from other cause.\n\nNow, 40.5 + 2 = 42.5 people die from other cause.. Their average age = 30.\n18 people die from infections. Now, 18 + 1 = 19 people. Their average age = 70.\n27 die of natural causes. Now, 27 + 1.5 = 28.5 people. Their average age = 80.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, we have the following data to calculate life expectancy without death from injury:\n\n\n\nAge\nPercent\n\n\n2\n10%\n\n\n30\n42.5%\n\n\n70\n19%\n\n\n80\n28.5%\n\n\n\nWeighted average: 2 * 10% + 30 * 42.5% + 70 * 19% + 80 * 28.5% = 49.05\nThis is a gain of 49.05 – 47.9 = 1.15 years.\nAnother way to interpret the 1.15 years: “Other cause” people gain 0 years, “infections” people gain 40 years (from 30 to 70), and “natural causes” people gain 50 years (from 30 to 80), for a weighted average gain of 25.5 years for each of the 4.5 people who don’t die of injuries. Or, an increase in total life expectancy of (25.5 * 4.5% ) = 1.15 years.\n5. Calculate “Life Years” Loss From Infections\nThis is the easiest step, do the same logic as before. The 18 people who died of infections now die of natural causes.\nSo, of every 100 people born:\n\n10% die from malaria before they reach 5: 10 people. Their average age = 2\n90% live: 90 people. Of the 90 people who make it to age 5:\n\n 50% die before reaching their 60: 90 * 50% = 45 people. Their average age = 30.\n 50% live to age 60: 90 * 50% = 45 people. Of these 45 people:\n\n 0% die from infections. Their average age = 70.\n 100% die of natural causes: 45 * 100% = 45 people. Their average age = 80.\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, we have the following data to calculate life expectancy without death from infections:\n\n\n\nAge\nPercent\n\n\n2\n10%\n\n\n30\n45%\n\n\n70\n0%\n\n\n80\n45%\n\n\n\nWeighted average = 2 * 10% + 30 * 45% + 80 * 45% = 49.7\nThis is a gain of 49.7 – 47.9 = 1.8 years.\nAnother way to interpret the 1.8 years: Of the 18 people who previously die of infections, now they all die of natural causes (from 70 to 80 years old, gaining 10 years each). And so, 18% of the population gains 10 years, so total expected life years gained = 10 * 18% = 1.8 years.\n6. Wrap It Up\nNow the candidate should compare the different losses: lives lost versus “life years” lost. This is a moral/ethical judgment that the candidate has to make. If the candidate asks what the health minister values more: lives or life-years — tell the candidate that the health minister wants the candidate to make the choice and explain that choice.\nAs a “cherry on top”, the candidate can discuss net GDP lost to society as a third variable to consider (the interviewer can prompt for this discussion as well). Children who die from malaria haven’t used up many resources yet. Their parents can often reproduce again. Seniors are typically past their prime productive years. 30-year olds have consumed a lot in terms of energy from their parents and education from the community and are only in the middle of paying back this debt to society. They often leave families behind who then look to the government or other community entities for support. Thus, 30-year-olds’ deaths are the most costly to a society.\n\n\n\n\nLives Lost\n“Life Years” Lost\nSample GDP Loss\n\n\nMalaria\n10%\n5.1 years\n4%\n\n\nInjuries\n4.5%\n1.15 years\n10%\n\n\nInfections\n18%\n1.8 years\n1%\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: new business.\nConsulting Firm: Boston Consulting Group (BCG) first round job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: manufacturing; paper products.\nCase Interview Question #00581: Our client USA Traffic Signs is a $100 million manufacturer and national supplier of public signs headquartered in Binghamton, New York. Their products consist mostly of public road and traffic signs, street signs, sign posts, custom signs, and parking signs, but are also used in some businesses, construction sites, or universities throughout the United States.\nRecently, the CEO of USA Traffic Signs is considering entering the paper label industry next year (year 2010). Paper labels have a wide variety of uses in many different markets (e.g. pharmaceutical labels, business cards, etc) and so our client wants to know if there is any particular segment for them to enter, how to enter, and whether you recommend entry into paper label industry at all. How would you go about the case?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to you if asked)\n\nPaper label industry growth is expected to be approximately 2% in next few years.\nFour major players own 70% of the paper label market, the rest is divided among many small players.\nSome of the large segments within the paper label industry are: healthcare (pharmaceutical labels), business (cards), manufacturing, food, and apparel.\nThe four major players exist equally in all these segments. However, some segments are more quality / premium driven, others are more cost driven.\nThe management of USA Traffic Signs believe that they can capture 10% of the current market of paper label.\n\nExhibit 1: Paper Label Sales from 2005 to 2010 (numbers for year 2010 are estimated)  \nBlue bar: Premium labels (left axis, unit sales in millions)\nGreen bar: Cheap labels (left axis, unit sales in millions)\nBlack line: Price per label (right axis)\n\nAverage labels per roll: 35\nAverage rolls per printer: 20\nAverage price per printer is $10.00.\n\nExhibit 2: Competitors and Estimated Market Share of 2009 healthcare paper label market \nPossible Answer:\n1. Quantitative Analysis\nFrom Exhibit 1, the candidate should be able to estimate the sales of paper labels for next year (2010): 700 million units sold at $3.00 per unit = 700 million * $3.00 = $2.1 billion\nPlus, sales from label printers:\n\n 700 million labels / 35 labels per roll = 20 million rolls\n 20 million rolls / 20 rolls per printer = 1 million printers.\n At $10 each, this is $10 million.\n\nTotal Sales for Year 2010 = $2.1 billion + $10 million = $2.11 billion.\n2. Qualitative Analysis\na. Competitors\nBased on Exhibit 2, the candidate should realize that the breakdown of major competitors in healthcare label market is representative of the entire paper label market.\nA few dominant players may make entry into the healthcare segment very difficult: perhaps they are already employing the razor-blade business model (label printers are sold at a low price or given away for free, to earn a premium on paper labels). They currently focus on premium labels, it’s the small players who are focused on the cheap segment.\nb. Product\n\nIf entering this market, should the client sell printers, labels, or both?\nShould the client sell service too?\n\nc. Premium vs. Cheap label segment\n\nPremium label segment:\n\n It’s good for the razor-blade business model\n It helps maintain the client company’s current image\n\n\nCheap label segment:\n\n This segment can be used to grow market share fast\n But, the cheap label segment offers less flexibility in razor-blade model or adding services\n\n\n\nd. Customers\nWhat do customers value most in paper labels?\ne. Approach of Market Entry\n\nAcquisition\n\n could be very expensive\n Full control\n Fast\n\n\nForming joint venture with another company\n\n Less control\n Brand issues with other companies\n\n\nStarting from scratch\n\n Very time consuming\n Full control\n\n\n\n3. Conclusion\nFrom the above analysis, we see that the market opportunity is very large ($2.11 billion), but the growth is somewhat slow and there are several large players who dominate the industry and make entry difficult. High market capture may be difficult, however, the cllient company management’s estimate of 10% means revenue of $211 million, over twice the size of the existing company ($100 million)! Also, the different industry segments present interesting options for entering the market as a premium or cheap player.\nImportantly, with printers and labels, the client can use a razor-blade business model where the printer only works with the same company’s labels, thus retaining customers (offering both labels and printers is wise). This also suggests that the company should own the manufacturing process, and so a joint-venture is out of the question.\nThis case provides no profitability metrics – a hugely important figure. Thus, an outstanding candidate must make a recommendation without full information and should be comfortable with this kind of ambiguity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

It has also become a genericized trademark for any adhesive bandage in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada and India.\nHow big is the U.S. market for Band-Aids (the brand)?\nPossible Solution:\nA market sizing or estimation case question should be solved by posing and answering a number of sub-questions. To estimate the U.S. market size for Band-Aid bandages, the following sub-questions and answers could be used:\n\nWhat are Band-Aids used for?\nWho are Band-Aids users?\nWithin each segment of Band-Aids users, how often do they need to use Band-Aids?\n\n1. What are Band-Aids used for? Band-Aid bandages are mostly used to cover up minor cuts.\n2. Who are Band-Aids users?\nAssume that Band-Aid holds 75% of the U.S. market for adhesive bandages. The market can be segmented into two main categories of users: kids aged 16 and under who tend to get cuts more often, and adults over 16 who are a little more careful.\nAssume that the average life of a person is 80 years, and the U.S. population is evenly distributed. That means that kids 16 and under represent 16 / 80 = 20% of the U.S. population, or 300 million * 20% = 60 million, and adults over 16 are 300 million * 80% = 240 million.\n3. Within each segment of Band-Aids users, how oftern do they use Band-Aids?\nAssume that kids 16 and under get a cut once every two months on average. Once every two months equals six times per year, for a total of 60 million kids * 6 cuts = 360 million bandages. Assume that it takes on average three days to cure a cut and bandages are replaced once a day. That makes for 360 million * 3 = 1,080 million bandages.\nAssume that adults over 16 get a cut once every six months which also lasts three days, with bandages being replaced every day. That is 2 cuts per year * 3 days per cut * 240 million people = 1,440 million bandages.\nThe total number of bandages, then, is 1,080 + 1,440 = 2,520 million bandages.\nAssume there are approximately 20 bandages in a package, and a package sells for $5. The total size of the market expressed in US Dollars is therefore 2,520 million / 20 * $5 which is approximately $630 million. If Band-Aid holds 75% of this market, that is equal to $630 * 75% = $470 million.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: estimate, guesstimate.\nConsulting Firm: Accenture first round job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: sports, leisure, recreation.\nCase Interview Question #00574: The NBA (National Basketball Association)  is the preeminent men’s professional basketball league in North America. With thirty franchised member clubs (29 in the United States and 1 in Canada), the NBA is widely considered to be the premier men’s professional basketball league in the world.\nHow many basketballs are purchased by the NBA and all its teams each year?\nPossible Approach:\nEstimation cases are based on logical reasoning applied to a number of known data points (your assumptions) to arrive at the desired  answer. Since your logic is what is tested, lay it out clearly for the interviewer. Before you start making assumptions, tell the interviewer what your logic is going to be to figure out the answer. Once you have done that, make the assumptions and do the math.\n1. Logical Reasoning \nTo come up with a logical approach to solve an estimation case, start with the answer and reason backwards about causal relationships. Think of this as a tree diagram. For example, start out by thinking what basketballs are used for (the cause for purchasing basketballs). Most likely, they are used for games and practice. These are then the first two branches of your tree diagram. To continue to solve this case, attack one branch at a time. Do not try to move down different paths at the same time, it will only lead to confusion.\nTo continue with the NBA basketball case, let’s take the “games branch” of our tree diagram. We know that the number of basketballs is a function of the number of games and the number of balls per game (the causal relationship).\nWhat does the number of games depend upon? It depends on the number of teams and the length of the season. You can make an assumption about the number of teams and length of the season or you can continue to go down the tree to find the root causes for those numbers. Make sure, however, that you do not make the problem too complicated. If you have a reasonable idea of the numbers, go with the assumption and start filling in the equations. Examples of digging deeper into the drivers of the number of games are estimating the number of teams by the number of major cities in the US, or estimating the number of games by the length of the season in weeks and an estimate of the average number of games per week per team.\nOnce you have figured out the first branch, do not forget to do the second one. It is easy to get wrapped up in a long chain of reasoning and completely forget about the “practice branch” in this case. Write the number you came up with for the game balls on a piece of paper so you do not have to use valuable brain space to remember it. Most interviewers won’t mind if you take simple notes. A similar reasoning approach as above for the practice balls would try to estimate the number of teams, the number of players who practice on each team, the number of practice sessions, and the average life of a ball.\n2. Doing the Math\nOnce you have come up with the logical approach, you have to fill in the numbers. Again, choose easy numbers for your assumptions. Even though the length of the NBA season might be 82 games, choose 80 because it is easier to use. It is important that you use the right equations to calculate your answers. The number of games, for example, was determined to be a function of the number of teams and the length of the season. Say that there are 30 teams (easy number) times 80 games in a season, that makes 30 * 80 = 2,400 games played per year, correct? Wrong! Since one game takes two teams to play, you have double counted the number of games. The correct answer is 1,200.\nSince most of us are used to calculators and don’t often add up large strings of numbers in our heads, it is useful to practice your arithmetic. Calculators are generally not allowed in a case interview, and it can be quite embarrassing to stumble on a simple calculation in an interview. This danger is especially prevalent since you will probably be a bit nervous, and thus less able to think clearly. The only way to get better at it is by practice, lots of it.\n3. Sanity Check\nWhen you have come up with a final answer, do a quick check to see if it is reasonable. You don’t want to say with a big smile on your face that you have calculated the number of basketballs in the NBA to be 10 million. Think first whether it sounds reasonable, and possibly do a quick check. For example, you could multiply the number of balls by an estimate of the average price for a basketball, and see if the resulting figure is reasonable in relation to what you would estimate the total NBA budget to be. If it turns out to be around 50%, you have probably made a logical or calculation error somewhere along the way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

To estimate the number of horses in the U.S., the following sub-questions and possible solutions could be used:\n\n What are horses used for in the U.S.?\n How many different types of use can you think of?\n How many horses are there in each category?\n\nFirst of all, think about where you can find horses in the U.S. Assume that horses are used for the following six purposes:\n\nriding schools\npersonal pets\nracing\ncarriages\npolice\nzoos & ranches\n\nThe United States has a population of approximately 300 million.\nAssume 80% of the U.S. population is physically able to ride a horse. Assume that of this 80%, one out of 100 rides horses at a riding school. That makes for 300 million * 80% * 1% = 2.4 million riding school customers. If each person rides a horse once a week for an hour, and a horse normally rides two hours a day, five days a week, then one horse is sufficient for 10 riders. That means there are 2.4 million / 10 = 240,000 horses for 2.4 million riders at riding schools.\nNow assume that for every 10 people taking riding lessons, there is one person that owns his/her own horse. That is 2.4 million riders / 10 = 240,000 horses owned as personal pets.\nAssume that in the U.S. there is one race track for every 3 million people in the population. That means that there are 100 race tracks in the country. Further assume that there are horse races on six days per week, and that each day has 8 races. That is approximately 50 races per week. If there are six horses per race, and every horse races once per week, then there are 50 races per week * 6 horses per race = 300 different horses per race track. 300 horses per race track * 100 race tracks = 30,000 race horses in the country.\nAssume that the City of Chicago has 3 million people, and that it has approximately 200 carriages to move people around. That is approximately 15,000 people per carriage. If this holds for the U.S. as a whole, there must be approximately 300 million / 15,000 = 20,000 carriages in the US. Assume each carriage is drawn by two horse on average (it could be drawn by 1, or 2, or 3, or 4 horses), that makes for 20,000 * 2 = 30,000 horses for carriages.\nAssume that the Chicago Police Department has 100 horses. That is half the number of carriages. Repeat the math for the population as a whole, and you get another 10,000 horses on the police force in the whole country.\nAssume that there are 1,000 ranches in the U.S. and on average each ranch has 50 horses. Thus, 1,000 * 50 = 50,000 horses in total are living in ranches or zoos.\nTherefore, the total number of horses in the U.S. is: 240,000 + 240,000 + 30,000 + 30,000 + 10,000 + 50,000 = 600,000.\nA quick sanity check: 300 million people for 600,000 horses is approximately one horse for every 500 humans. That is plausible.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

On 25 December 1991, the USSR was dissolved into 15 post-Soviet states. The Russian Federation, successor of the Russian SFSR, assumed the Soviet Union’s rights and obligations and is recognized as its continued legal personality.\nYour client George Soros is a wealthy Hungarian-American business magnate, investor and philanthropist living in New York City. Currently he is the chairman of Soros Fund Management, with a net worth estimated at $20 billion. Soros bought a Russian satellite after the break up of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. Later on a large Russian telecommunication company has offered Soros $100 million for the satellite. Your client wants to know whether he should accept the offer and sell the satellite. How would you advise your client on this deal?\nPossible Answer:\nThis pricing and valuation case is an example of one where you are asked to use your creativity to generate some ideas. The purchase price of the satellite is not important. Taking this into account would be an instance of the sunk cost fallacy.\nCandidate: Very interesting case. May I take a moment to structure my thought?\nInterviewer: Sure go ahead.\nCandidate: So, to determine the value of the satellite, it is necessary to assess the cash flows it can generate at its most productive use, and discount these cash flows at an appropriate discount rate to calculate the net present value (NPV). Therefore, we first need to find out what the most productive use of the satellite is.\nAs far as I know, satellites can be used for transmission of data such as telephone, TV, or computer data. They may also be used for taking pictures of the earth (including spying activities) or to do research by observing events on earth and in space.\nInterviewer: Good point! Let’s assume that this particular satellite is of the data transmission variety.\nCandidate: OK, knowing that we can assess the use of the satellite for different data transmission purposes. Take for example telephone services, we could evaluate the demand for telephone services and compare the costs of alternative transmission technologies such as wire and land-based radio transmission. Another alternative is to evaluate the cost of launching a new satellite.\nInterviewer: Good idea. There is only one problem. Due to the orbit of the satellite, it can only send and receive signals during twelve hours of the day: from 3:00 pm until about 3:00 am.\nCandidate: That is a problem, because it will eliminate a lot of possible uses unless this limitation is somehow offset. We might want to investigate the possibility of launching a second satellite with an opposite pattern to cover the full twenty-four hours. This cost would need to be compared to that of launching a satellite in an orbit that would allow twenty-four hour a day transmission.\nInterviewer: The cost of launching a 24 hour satellite is $50 million more than launching a 12 hour one.\nCandidate: Well, that means that the value-added of our satellite would only be $50 million. Looking at alternatives, one possible opportunity which may not be unduly limited by the time frame is television broadcasting. Most television shows are watched during the late afternoon and evening hours. We can evaluate the demand for television in the former Soviet Union and determine what the costs of alternative transmission technologies such as cable or non-satellite transmission would be.\nAnother possible use of the satellite is for transmitting computer data. Given the time frame that the satellite is available, it may be possible to transmit data during the evening and night. This way, it is possible to update computer systems on a daily basis. This may be useful for companies like banks who update their records daily.\nInterviewer: We’re running out of time soon. Can you summarize your analysis and give the client a final recommendation?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: pricing & valuation.\nConsulting Firm: Ernst & Young (EY) Advisory second round job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: tourism, hospitality, lodging.\nCase Interview Question #00577: Hilton Hotels & Resorts (formerly known as Hilton Hotels) is an international hotel chain which includes many luxury hotels and resorts as well as select service hotels. Hilton hotels are either owned by, managed by, or franchised to independent operators by global hospitality company Hilton Worldwide (formerly, Hilton Hotels Corporation). Hilton Hotels became the first coast-to-coast hotel chain of the United States in 1943. As of 2010, there are now over 530 Hilton branded hotels across the world in 78 countries across six continents.\nThe President and CEO of Hilton Hotels is concerned that after nearly a decade of rapid growth, his hotel chain is showing some sign of over-expansion. One issue that particularly troubles him is that the prices charged by some of the hotels are not well aligned with the Hilton brand. You have been hired to address his concern. How would you help develop a pricing strategy for Hilton Hotels & Resorts?\nPossible Answer:\nPricing is one key element of the marketing mix. It is an attribute of the product or service that the client company sells, so we will first need to find out what the client sells and to who.\nCandidate: First of all, I’d like to know a bit more about our client company, its customer base, and its market positioning. Does the Hilton hotel chain cater to vacationers or business travelers? Is its product/service consistent with a low budget, medium, or up-market positioning?\nInterviewer: The Hilton hotel chain caters to both vacationers and business travelers, depending on the location. And its service and amenities are considered to be in the middle of the spectrum.\nCandidate: OK, since the hotel caters to different clients at different locations, we may have to consider a differentiated pricing policy.\nInterviewer: Good point. Go on please.\nCandidate: Usually business travelers and vacation travelers have very different consumer behavior. I would assume that business travelers are likely to be a little less price sensitive than vacationers. Is that a fair assumption?\nInterviewer: Yes, we can think so.\nCandidate: Then we will have to segment the travelers into the business and vacation categories, and check what each group of travelers value the most in their choice of hotels, and how they make purchase decisions.\nInterviewer: Good. Actually we conducted a survey of business and vacation travelers and found out that business travelers value service and convenience above other things within a given price range, while vacation travelers are mainly concerned with price.\nCandidate: That’s very valuable information. Based on that traveler preference, we can create a differentiated pricing scheme by giving discounts to guests who stay over a Saturday night or who stay longer than 4 days or so, since these are likely to be vacation travelers.\nOnce we have learned in which markets the hotel competes, we have to identify what its competitors are. The range of possible prices the hotel can charge will be limited by the pricing policies of our direct competitors, and by the pricing of substitutes such as up-market or budget hotels.\nInterviewer: OK. Every location of Hilton hotels has a number of competitors within close proximity. These hotels serve the same market segment. Our client’s amenities are a bit better than those of its competitors, (i.e. HDTV, high speed internet, fridge and coffee makers in the room) while service levels and location are similar or slightly less than those of its competitors. The competitors’ prices for a week-day stay range from $100 to $150 per night and from $120 to $200 per night on the weekends.\nCandidate: Let’s assume that the prices currently charged by our client and its competitors result in a supply and demand equilibrium at a certain occupancy rate that is less than 100%. In other words, there is sufficient capacity to meet customer demand. Our client Hilton has a choice of charging more than the market clearing price, charging the same, or charging less. The choice depends on the price elasticity of the market and the likely reaction by competitors.\nSince hotels will likely have high fixed cost associated with the operation of the real estate, there will be an incentive to lower prices to increase demand because marginal costs for a hotel room are minimal. This is much like the airline industry.\nMuch like in the airline industry, however, price competition may erode industry profits because competitors will likely match any decreases in price by one hotel. A price war, therefore is not a good idea. Lowering prices only makes sense if demand is elastic, and a new lower equilibrium price could be established which leads to sufficiently increased demand to offset the margin losses. Think about whether business travelers demand would be very elastic; probably not. Vacation travelers demand would be somewhat elastic, but it is not known whether it is elastic enough.\nCharging higher prices would probably lead to decreased demand because our service level (which is important to business travelers) does not justify the premium over competitors’ prices.\nThe remaining choice, then, is to charge market prices. One possible way to improve yields is to utilize a more sophisticated market segmentation, and rather than having two price classes (business travelers and vacation travelers), establish more segments with different price points. Through yield management techniques, the Hilton hotel chain may be able to better manage its fixed capacity and increase average yield.\nInterviewer: Great! Let’s wrap up here and come up with a recommendation for the client.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "title": "Biotech Startup Invents New Sugar Beets Technology",
        "url": "http://www.consultingcase101.com/biotech-startup-invents-new-sugar-beets-technology/",
        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: pricing & valuation.\nConsulting Firm: KPMG Advisory second round job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: healthcare: biotech, life sciences; startups; agriculture.\nCase Interview Question #00578: Sugar beet is a plant whose tuber (modified plant structures that are enlarged to store nutrients, used by plants to survive the winter or dry months and provide energy and nutrients for regrowth during the next growing season) contains a high concentration of sucrose. It is grown commercially for sugar production. The United States harvested more than 1,004,000 acres (4,065 km²) of sugar beets in 2008. In 2009, sugar beet accounted for 20% of the world’s sugar production.\nRecently, a small biotech startup company located in San Francisco bay area has come up with a revolutionary new seed for sugar beets. Their new sugar beets are exactly the same as regular beets but yield twice as much sugar. The two inventors of the new seed, also the co-founders the startup company, wish to sell the  patent (which is valid for 20 years) to Monsanto (NYSE: MON), a large multinational agricultural biotechnology corporation, so that the inventors can pay off their venture capitalist and retire to an island with lots of sunshine, beach and palm trees. You have been hired to help them set the price for their new sugar beets technology. So, how would you determine the value of the patent?\nPossible Answer:\nInterviewer: First of all, can you tell me what determines the price of a new technology or new product?\nCandidate: The price of a new product is usually determined by the market.\nInterviewer: OK, let’s assume that there are no inputs for the new seed technology (as it’s already produced and can simply be cloned), and that agricultural goods are commodities sold to a dispersed market of buyers who individually can exercise little power over the price.\nCandidate: Well, in that case the price will be based on the value of the product to the buyer, and by competition from similar and substitute goods.\nInterviewer: Good, why don’t we start out with the competition from similar goods first. Can you think of any similar products that pose as competition to the client’s new seed technology?\nCandidate: Since this is a patent, I would say there are no similar goods, and therefore no competition.\nInterviewer: OK, how about substitute goods then?\nCandidate: Substitute goods are regular sugar beet seeds and possibly seeds for sugar cane.\nInterviewer: Actually, sugar cane is grown in entirely different climates and is not considered to be a competing product in this market.\nCandidate: OK, that rules out one possibility and makes the solution easier. So, the only possible competition, then, is from regular sugar beet seeds. The value of that product should be compared to the value of our new seeds. Seeds need to be grown into beets which requires land and labor. The farmers using our new seeds has two possibilities: they can eith grow twice as much sugar with the same amount of land and labor or they can grow the same amount of sugar with only half the land and labor. (Let’s look just at land for simplicity here.)\nInterviewer: That’s a good point. But, do you believe the farmers can sell twice as much sugar?\nCandidate: Let’s see, one individual farmer in a commodities market should be able to sell all his increased output at the market price, but if every farmer uses the new technology and doubles his output, the price of sugar will have to fall. The question then becomes whether the demand for sugar is elastic.\nInterviewer: OK, ssing common sense, would you expect anyone to consume more sugar  when the price of sugar drops? For example, bake more cookies or make more lemonade?\nCandidate: Probably not, because sugar is already a pretty cheap staple product and rarely the most expensive ingredient in something. We may have to think about other uses for sugar such as making alcohol to use as a substitute for gasoline. This market’s demand would probably be elastic.\nInterviewer: That is an interesting idea, but let’s assume demand for sugar is fixed for now. (Note: this is an example of a clue where the interviewer does not want you to pursue this any further)\nCandidate: OK, having established these facts, let’s get back to the original line of the argument. If demand for sugar is fixed, then the only possibility for the farmer is to use only half the land to grow the same amount of sugar. Then we can determine the value of the land saved. This could be determined by the market price of agricultural land times the area saved.\nInterviewer: that’s a bit of a problem. There is a glut of land available, and it is unlikely that the farmers will be able to sell their land at all within a period of a few years.\nCandidate: Oops!\nInterviewer: Now what?\nCandidate: Well, another possibility is to see if the farmer may have other uses for the land. Maybe they can use the land saved to grow a different crop?\nInterviewer: It is possible to grow other crops on that type of soil. For instance, cabbage grows well in those types of climates. The problem is that the profit margins on cabbage are only 20% of those on sugar beets. The beach and palm trees are seemingly starting to slip away from our inventors.\nCandidate: It seems that the farmers will not derive a whole lot of benefit from the new seeds.\nInterviewer: OK, so far we have looked at the end consumers of refined sugar and at the producers of the beets now. What other players could possibly gain from the new invention? \nCandidate: A good way to approach this is to use a value chain or process flow. Do we have any information regarding how sugar finally reaches the end consumer?\nInterviewer: Sugar beets are produced by the farmer, then shipped to the sugar refinery by truck. The sugar refinery makes sugar crystals from the beets and packages them. The packaged sugar is then shipped to retailers where it is distributed to the end consumer.\nCandidate: I see. The sugar that reaches the end consumer is the same sugar and the same amount that would be shipped if old seeds were used. Therefore, there are no cost savings there. From the farmer to the refinery, however, the amount of beets shipped would be only half the traditional amount. Trucking expenses should drop by 50%. The question is whether the refinery also realizes any production benefits from the reduced number of beets.\nInterviewer: Good. As it turns out, the processing cost of the new beets will be 25% higher per beet than the old ones.\nCandidate: OK, if the number of sugar beets is reduced by 50% and the cost per beet is only 25% higher, then there will be a 37.5% production cost savings (1 – 50% * 125% = 37.5%) to the refinery. The refinery should be willing to pay the farmer a higher price for the new beets. The total savings from the new seeds can be summed up as follows: farmers gain 10% on their profit margins from the opportunity to grow cabbage on half their land (100% is original profit. profit margins on cabbage are only 20% of those on sugar beets, so 20% of this 100% on 50% of the land equals 10%: 50% * 20% = 10%); trucking expenses from the farmer to the refinery are cut by 50%; and production costs are reduced by 37.5%. Next, we need to find out how much each step contributes to the final price of sugar.\nInterviewer: Good, I do have the information for that. Growing the sugar is 40% of the cost, trucking 10%, refining 30%, and distribution 20%.\nCandidate: Then the savings are 10% * 40% = 4% in growing; 50% * 10% = 5% in trucking; and 37.5% * 30% = 11% in refining. This adds up to a total savings of 20%. Multiply this percentage saving by the annual sugar demand and we get a dollar value of annual savings.\nInterviewer: Excellent! Now the question is: how would you estimate the annual demand for sugar in the United States?\nNote: At this point, this pricing and valuation case becomes an estimation and market sizing case. See some of the other market sizing or estimation case examples on how to do this. If we assume that the resulting figure is $2 billion, then take the net present value (NPV) of 20 years (the length of the patent) of $2 billion * 20%. Don’t worry, the interviewer won’t expect you to actually calculate this off the top of your head, as long as you tell the interviewer that this is the approach you would take.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: industry analysis; finance & economics.\nConsulting Firm: NERA Economic Consulting first round job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: automotive, motor vehicles.\nCase Interview Question #00569: Our client Polaris Industries (NYSE: PII) is a manufacturer of snowmobiles, ATV (All Terrain Vehicle), and neighborhood electric vehicles. Headquartered in Medina, Minnesota, USA, the company had total operating income of $220 million on revenue of $2.0 billion in fiscal year 2010.\nFor this case, your consulting team is doing market research work for the ATV division of Polaris Industries. The Head of ATV division wants to understand the cyclicality of the ATV business. He has some historical information about the industry wide sales of ATVs from 1980 till year 2007: see the chart below (Figure 1). The client wants to know the exact reasons for the cyclicality of ATV business. Specifically:\n\nWhy did the ATV sales fall in 1980?\nWhy did ATV sales then flat out around 2000s?\nWhy did they rise in the 2000s?\nWhat will happen after year 2007?\n\n\nAdditional Information: (to be given to you if asked) \n\nATV, or All Terrain Vehicle, also known as a quad, quad bike, three-wheeler, or four-wheeler, is defined by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) as a vehicle that travels on low-pressure tires, with a seat that is straddled by the operator, along with handlebars for steering control. As the name implies, it is designed to handle a wider variety of terrain than most other vehicles.\nATV is primarily an off-road vehicle used for recreational purposes. It has 4 wheels, and is typically a little smaller than a motorcycle and people ride it like a motorcycle.\nUsers – It is very popular among kids and adults, or ages 15 to 50.\n\nNotes to the Interviewer:\nDon’t allow the candidate to open the case with a framework. Instead, dive straight into the case. This presents a more uncommon challenge: having to think on one’s feet constantly. There are hundreds of reasons why annual ATV sales have fluctuated so much. The candidate should be able to brainstorm ideas and conduct a conversation with the interviewer to identify which reasons make the most sense and which ones do not.\nThe interviewer should allow the conversation to float to different areas, challenging the candidate as he or she analyzes different factors. This is largely a discussion case, but the interviewer should keep the discussion focused and should press the candidate constantly.\nPossible Answer:\nThis “Industry Analysis” type of case tests a candidate’s understanding of macro-economics and how the economic cycles impact industry wide sales.\n\nIn the 1980s: initially ATVs were 3 wheelers and they had a lot of safety concerns. So the U.S. government essentially banned them. That explains the drastic fall.\nIn the 1990s: 4 wheeler ATVs became popular as they were safer. People wore helmets. ATVs were restricted to off-road trails. This caused the stabilization of sales.\n2000 – 2007: The U.S. economy was going through a housing market bubble. People had a lot of credit available. They used the money to buy ATVs, and also other luxury products or recreational goods. So the rise in sales number.\nYear 2007: A credit crunch in the housing and financial market.\nAfter 2007: ATV sales will likely fall again and stabilize somewhere in the halfway mark by year 2011 or maybe 2012.\n\nNote:\n\n The U.S. economy went through several cycles between 1980 and 2000. The dot-com bubble was around year 2002.\n ATV user demographics – the user population remained about the same.\n ATV prices grew with inflation.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

It is named after Southern California businessman and booster Henry E. Huntington. Huntington Memorial Hospital is a community-based medical center, which provides acute medical care and community services to the San Gabriel Valley and nearby communities. The hospital is a world class destination for the treatment of epilepsy, prostate cancer, robotic minimally invasive surgery and bariatric surgery.\nHistorically, the Huntington Memorial Hospital has been doing very well. In the last few years, however, the hospital has been hurting. The 635 bed institution has had consistently high patient volume growth, but is seeing a rise in the number of uninsured patients. Recently, it has been under operating margin pressure from the local government that is requiring the hospital to reduce its budget $100 million over the next three years. As a stipulation, the hospital cannot forgo service in this budget cut – it must maintain the same standard of service. At the same time, the management of Huntington Memorial Hospital are also looking for various ways to grow revenue.\nYour consulting firm has been retained to assist the hospital management. What do you recommend about the budget cut, and how do you recommend growing revenue? Finally, what implementation challenges to do you see in your recommendations?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to you if asked)\n1. Product\n\n The Huntington Memorial Hospital is known for decent quality – relative to its competitors it is middle-of-the-road\n The hospital provides a wide range of service, from simple medical examinations to high-end surgery procedures (e.g. from ankle sprains to brain surgery)\n There is a growing demand for higher-margin services, like emergency room procedures\n\n2. Capacity \n\n The hospital management have noticed unused capacity in their hospital – high quality doctors are spending time doing routine medical examinations\n Also, they have noticed doctors are working outside of their profession in an effort to speed-up the process\n\n3. Costs\n\nMajor variable costs: personnel and supplies\n\n Doctors have been forced to take care of administrative tasks\n Supply use has been high (ask the candidate how he/she would evaluate this, answer: compare waste to comparable peer hospitals)\n Specifically, the volume of disposable waste has been growing\n\n\nMajor fixed costs: utilities, SG&A (Selling, General and Administrative Expenses), sales and marketing, and capital expenditures (e.g. equipment upgrades)\n\nNote to Interviewer:\nThis case focuses on data collection and diagnosis. The problems with the hospital are not difficult to diagnose, but it is more challenging to gather the data and understand exactly how to re-do the budget so that $100 million can be saved over the next three years.\nAs the interviewee asks questions about the hospital, ask the interviewee how he or she would collect the data to answer each question. Then, as problems surface, ask how the interviewee would compare those data / results to other data available.\nPossible Answer:\n1. Addressing Capacity Issues\n\nThe hospital management can hire additional talent in areas that are needed\nRe-align doctors: The hospital management should have their doctors stay within their own practice to keep the organization efficient and ensure they are working on what they are best at\nData\n\n The candidate would want to collect information about hospital beds usage rates, and doctors’ hours worked\n Then the candidate can compare the data to internal metrics over time, and compare to other peer hospitals\n\n\nPatient turnover\n\n The hospital can make their beds more compact\n The hospital should encourage home-care whenever possible to lower turnover\n\n\n\n2. Addressing Profit Issues\n\nPersonnel cost\n\n Instead of letting high quality (and expensive!) doctors do routine medical examinations, the hospital could hire lower salaried generalists to deal with these kind of low margin procedures\n\n\nSupplies cost\n\n Volume: encourage lower use of disposables (be environmentally friendly)\n Price: re-negotiate cost of supplies with vendors, or even look for new, cheaper vendors\n\n\nUtilities cost: no problem\nSG&A cost: few problems\nSales and marketing cost: no problem\nEquipment upgrade cost:\n\n Focus on equipment maintenance to reduce frequency of repair\n Lower the quality of luxury equipment – perhaps use lower quality beds\n\n\nRevenue growth:\n\n Focus on high-margin services, such as emergency room procedures\n Advertise in other communities and in national medical journals or national conferences\n\n\n\n3. Recommendation\na. Improve efficiency:\n\n Change talent pool to reflect service needs: hire generalists, re-align doctors, re-shift work focus\n Capacity: put hospital beds closer together, encourage home care to reduce turnover\n\nb. Cut Costs:\n\n Reduce volume (work with nurses & doctors) and price of supplies (work with suppliers)\n Cut unnecessary equipment costs, reduce quality if necessary\n\nc. Increase Revenue:\n\n Change service offering\n Grow customer base in new geographies\n\nPotential Risks with the recommendation:\n\n Economic risk: financial crisis, credit crunch, housing market problem, high unemployment rate\n Legal risk: ramifications with local government?\n Internal risk: unions / bureaucracy that make change difficult?\n Competitive response: how will other hospitals react?\n Community risk: PR issues with cutting quality in some areas\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

(NYSE: VZ, NASDAQ: VZ) is a global telecommunications company. The company’s headquarters are located in the Verizon Building in Lower Manhattan, New York City, United States. Verizon provides directory assistance services in the $50 billion United States telecommunication market. They also offer standard telecommunication services, including telephone, broadband internet, wireless, and television connectivity.\nIn recent years, there has been a growing threat from electronic competitors (like Skype, Google) who provide the same directory assistance services, but for far cheaper. In the past five years, your client Verizon has lost 4.5 million customers and their revenue from directory assistance services has declined at a 20% CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) in the past three years. They’ve approached you to help them turn around the directory assistance segment only. What should they do?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to you if asked)\n1.

The interviewer should focus the initial conversation on the market, competitors and the company to help the interviewee understand the issue. Then ask the interviewee what information would be needed to estimate profits for the next few years.\nAs the interviewee asks for additional information, provide the four Exhibits. Collectively, the 4 exhibits allow the interviewee to construct an income statement (See the one in “Possible Answer” section). After an income statement has been generated, ask him/her: how long until the company’s profits in directory assistance business become negative?\nThen, ask how to turn around that trend. After the interviewee brainstorms, see if “sell the business” is an idea. Then ask about the possibility of selling the business, such as:\n\nHow much would the business be purchased for?\nWhat are some challenges in selling this sort of business?\nWhat are some possible response from competitors?\n\nPossible Answers:\nExhibit 1:\n\n The number of subscribers from year 2004 – 2008 can be used to estimate the number of subscribers in the next two years.\n It is safe to assume the downward trend will continue and round to even numbers, so 5 million in 2009, 4 million in 2010.\n\nExhibit 2:\n\n Average calls received can be used to estimate the average number of calls made per subscriber: (50 * 5% ) + (10 * 15% ) + (1 * 80% ) = 4.8 calls per subscriber,\n It is safe to round 4.8 calls to 5 (even just from eyeballing)\n\nFrom Exhibits 1 and 2, we can derive revenues for year 2009 and 2010.\n\nYear 2009: 5 million subscribers * 5 calls per subscriber * $1 per call = $25 million\nYear 2010: 4 million subscribers * 5 calls per subscriber * $1 per call = $20 million\n\nExhibit 3: Costs\n\nFixed cost = $1 million + $250,000 * 4 + $3 million = $5 million per year\nVariable cost = cost of automated calls + cost of staffed calls\n\n Automated call cost = $0.10 * number of automated calls\n Staffed call cost = $1.00 * number of staffed calls\n\n\n\nBut, we need Exhibit 4 to get the number of automated calls and staffed calls first.\nExhibit 4: Calls Breakdown\nIt is safe to assume each state has a uniform number of calls, so the average of numbers means (25% * 2 + 50% * 2 + 75% * 2) / 6 = 50% of calls are automated, and 50% are staffed.\nTake the total # of calls from Exhibits 1 and 2, divide into automated and staffed calls, then multiple by the cost of each type of calls, we can set up an income statement table:\n\n\n\nYear\n2009\n2010\n\n\nTotal Revenues\n$25 million\n$20 million\n\n\nFixed cost\n$5 million\n$5 million\n\n\nVariable cost\n\n\n\n\nCost of automated calls\n25 million * 50% * $0.10 = $1.25 million\n20 million * 50% * $0.10 = $1.0 million\n\n\nCost of staffed calls\n25 million * 50% * $1.0 = $12.5 million\n20 million * 50% * $1.0 = $10.0 million\n\n\nTotal variable cost\n$13.75 million\n$11.0 million\n\n\nTotal Costs\n$18.75 million\n$16.0 million\n\n\nProfits\n$25 – $18.75 = $6.25 million\n$20 – $16.0 = $4.0 million\n\n\n\nRecommendation\nBased on our analysis, Year 2009 and 2010 will have projected profits of $6.25 million and $4.0 million, respectively. However, due to the steep downward trend in the number of unique callers, the profit will vanish in about 2 – 3 years. In order to turn around the directory assistance business, the client could take the following measures:\n\nUpgrade their data system\nCut cost by pushing more calls to automated system\nIncrease price per calls\nAdd additional services, such as direction assistance, traffic monitoring assistant, etc.\nImitate competitors like Skype or Google\nAcquire new competitors\nSell the business\n\nHowever, there are certain risks associated with the above mentioned measures:\n\n It may be difficult to reduce unionized workforce\n Customer response from re-pricing calls\n Customer user experience difference between automated calls and staffed calls\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: math problem.\nConsulting Firm: Booz & Company second round job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: Oil, Gas & Petroleum Industry.\nCase Interview Question #00570: You have been approached by the CEO of 7-Eleven, an international chain of convenience stores headquartered in Dallas, Texas, United States. 7-Eleven, operating under Seven-Eleven Japan Co. Ltd and owned by Seven & I Holdings Co. of Japan, is the world’s largest operator, franchisor and licensor of convenience stores, with more than 46,000 outlets as of 2012.\nIn the United States, 7-Eleven stores all have gas stations where they sell branded gas. The CEO has been using the same supplier of gas for the past 20 years. The contract with this gas supplier is coming up for renewal and the CEO is considering his options, either: renew the contract, sign a contract with a different gas supplier, or start his own new brand of gas. What do you recommend, and why?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to you if asked)\n1. Market\n\n Assume there are 2 levels of branded competitors for gas: high and low.\n Also assume there are 2 types of gas in the market: premium and regular.\n For high branded competitors, 20% of their volume sales are premium gas, 80% are regular.\n For low branded competitors, 10% of their volume sales are premium gas, 90% are regular.\n High branded competitors sell 90,000 gallons of gas per month on average, while low branded ones sell 110,000 gallons of gas per month on average.\n\n2. Company \n\n Currently 7-Eleven is using mid-premium gas supplier: right in the middle of premium and regular (so the client’s prices / profits are in the middle of high and low brands).\n Gas quality is pretty much the same from different suppliers. There is a perceived difference, but for our purposes, consider it negligible. For example, premium unleaded gas from Shell is of the same quality as premium unleaded from ARCO (Atlantic Richfield Company).\n\n3. Customers\n\n A report shows the following customer preferences in buying gas: 70% prioritize convenience (location), 20% prioritize price, 8% prioritize quality (brand), and 2% prioritize other services (car wash, air pump, convenience store, etc).\n\n4. Profits\n\n There is a $0.30 difference between premium and regular gas prices at high branded gas stations; while this difference is $0.20 at low branded gas stations.\n Low branded competitors sell regular gas for $3.67 and high branded sell it for $3.70.\n The profit margin on premium and regular gas at a low brand gas station is $0.15 per gallon and $0.10 per gallon, respectively.\n Relative to low branded gas, for high branded gas, the cost per gallon of regular gas is $0.03 higher and cost of premium gas is $0.05 higher.\n\nPossible Solution:\nThe various numbers presented in the “Additional Information” section are confusing if not drawn out clearly. Below are some data tables to serve this purpose, and show how the numbers are used to calculate profits.\nBasically, A * B * C = Total Profit for each type of gas, then sum the profits for total profit of each brand. It is by far the easiest to calculate the profit margin per gallon, then multiply by the number of gallons.\nTable 1. Breakdown of Gas Volume (A)\n\n\n\n\nPremium\nRegular\n\n\nHigh-brand\n20%\n80%\n\n\nLow-brand\n10%\n90%\n\n\n\nTable 2. Total Volume of Gas (B)\n\n\n\nHigh-brand\n90,000 gallons\n\n\nLow-brand\n110,000 gallons\n\n\n\nTable 3. Profit Margin of Gas per Gallon (C)\n\n\n\n\nPremium\nRegular\n\n\nHigh-brand\n\n\nPrice: $4.00\nCost: $3.77\nProfit: $0.23\n\n\n\n\nPrice: $3.70\nCost: $3.60\nProfit: $0.10\n\n\n\n\nLow-brand\n\n\nPrice: $3.87\nCost: $3.72\nProfit: $0.15\n\n\n\n\nPrice: $3.67\nCost: $3.57\nProfit: $0.10\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4. Total Profits (A * B * C)\n\n\n\n\nPremium\nRegular\nTotal Profits\n\n\nHigh-brand\n\n\nRevenue: 90,000 * 20% * $4.00 = $72,000\nProfit: 90,000 * 20% * $0.23 = $4,140\n\n\n\n\nRevenue: 90,000 * 80% * $3.70 = $266,400\nProfit: 90,000 * 80% * $0.10 = $7,200\n\n\n$4,140 + $7,200 = $11,340\n\n\nLow-brand\n\n\nRevenue: 110,000 * 10% * $3.87 = $42,570\nProfit: 110,000 * 10% * $0.15 = $1,650\n\n\n\n\nRevenue: 110,000 * 90% * $3.67 = $363,330\nProfit: 110,000 * 90% * $0.10 = $9,900\n\n\n$1,650 + $9,900 = $11,550\n\n\n\nThe difference between $11,340 and $11,550 is almost negligible: the profits from High-brand and Low-brand are close enough to be exactly the same.\nThis case requires fast sizing of what is important, some numbers, and then a broader perspective about which approach to take. The profitability is the same if using a high-brand versus a low-brand, and so there should be a discussion about the marketing issues in using a new brand versus keeping the existing one. In addition, there are risks to changing suppliers. Also, there are enormous setup costs to starting a new brand.\nThe interviewer should also press the candidate for marketing issues:\n\n How do the customer preference (70 / 20 / 8 / 2) relate?\n What do you look for when buying gas?\n\nConclusion: Probably, the best option for 7-Eleven is to continue using the same contract with the same gas supplier. However, there are arguments to be made for using a new brand of gas based on the company’s target customers, changing dynamics in the industry, etc. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: improve profitability.\nConsulting Firm: Bain & Company first round job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: electronics, semiconductors; manufacturing.\nCase Interview Question #00573: For this case, your client is Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd. (trading as Foxconn), a Taiwanese multinational electronics manufacturing company headquartered in Tucheng, New Taipei, Taiwan. As of 2011, Foxconn is the world’s largest maker of electronic components by revenue. Foxconn is primarily an original design manufacturer, and its clients include major American, European and Japanese electronics and information technology companies. Notable products which the company manufactures include the iPad, iPhone, iPod, Kindle, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360, etc.\nThe Chairman and President of Foxconn has approached your consulting firm to help grow profits. As an original design manufacturer, Foxconn receives a prototype from its clients (e.g., Apple) and it has the competency to produce as many as required. For example, Apple provides a design for a new iPhone, and Foxconn is responsible for producing millions. Currently, the company has a 10% profit margin. The Chairman wants your help in growing the profit margin to 20% within one year. How would you go about the case? What do you recommend?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate if asked)\n1. Market\n\n Foxconn has twice the market share as the number two player\n There is no significant threat from other competitors\n Also, it is too difficult for Foxconn to capture more share from competitors\n\n2. Company \n\n Foxconn makes its products faster, better and cheaper than any of its competitors\n Foxconn has a 5% cost advantage, and commands a sustained 5% price premium\n The company can ship products to anywhere in the world\n\n3. Product\n\n Foxconn’s products sells to worldwide market\n Other players’ products are of lower quality and don’t have as wide reach as Foxconn\n\nPossible Solution:\nThis “improving profitability” case tests two things: 1) an interviewee’s ability to stay cool under pressure, and 2) the foresight to question assumptions. In this case, as it turns out doubling the profit margin (from 10% to 20%) for an electronics manufacturing company isn’t possible – because the client company Foxconn is already the best in the world! As the interviewee suggests ideas to grow profit margin and works through a framework, the interviewer should aggressively shut down various ideas.\nKeep pushing until the interviewee finally asks whether the profit margin growth is possible. At that point, press for more suggestions. Finally when the interviewee is out of ideas, ask for a recommendation. See if the interviewee suggests plan that try to grow profitability, or if the interviewee addresses the fact that the goal of increasing profit margin from 10% to 20% isn’t feasible.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: market sizing; private equity.\nConsulting Firm: Simon-Kucher & Partners first round job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: oil, gas & petroleum industry; automotive, motor vehicles.\nCase Interview Question #00560: Your client Advent International is a global private equity firm focused on buyouts of companies in North America, Latin America, Western and Central Europe, and Asia. The firm focuses on international buyouts, growth and strategic restructuring in five core sectors: Business & Financial Services; Healthcare; Industrial; Retail, Consumer & Leisure; Technology, Media and Telecoms. Headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, United States, Advent operates from offices in 16 countries and employs over 170 investment professionals.\nRecently, Advent is considering an acquisition of Kirkland, Washington based Kenworth Truck Company. Kenworth mainly produces ground transportation gas tankers. Imagine the sort of trailer trucks that hold big containers of  gas and deliver them to gas stations, for example. How large is the market for these gas tanker trailers in the United States?\nPossible Answer:\nThis is mostly a marketing size case, with some creative work at the end. First, the interviewer should ask the candidate what variables drive the need for gas trailers. Then ask the candidate to estimate the market size based on those drivers (use volume). Once there is a market size, challenge the final number and see the candidate’s reaction to pushing on different assumptions.\nMarket Drivers \n\nDistance: how far gas needs to be transported\nVolume: total gas needed for delivery in a year in the U.S.\n\nEstimation (ask the candidate to make apppropriate assumption, then correct them if their assumptions are very different)\nThere are 300 million people in the U.S., and 100 million American households. On average each household owns 2 cars (or trucks). Therefore, roughly 200 million cars and trucks are owned by American households.\nThen, there are car rental companies like Avis, Alamo, Hertz, Enterprise, Budget Rent-A-Car etc, car sharing companies like Zipcar, taxi companies and corporate that own a fleet of vehicles. Assume cars owned by companies are only 25% of that owned by households. Thus, another 50 million cars and trucks are owned by Americans companies.\nSo, in total there are 250 million cars and trucks in the United States.\nAssume that in the U.S. cars and trucks are driven an average of 12,000 miles per year, and average gas mileage is 15 miles per gallon. Therefore, each car or truck will consume 12,000 / 15 = 800 gallons of gas every year.\nFor 250 million cars and trucks, 250 million * 800 = 200 billion gallons of gas are consumed in the U.S. per year\nAssume that 25% of the 200 billion gallons do not need transportation, so 200 billion * 75% = 150 billion gallons need transportation\nAssume that 20% of the 150 billion gallons are transported in ways other than trailers and trucks, so 150 billion * 80% = 120 billion gallons of gas are transported by gas tanker trailers.\nEach gas trailer holds 8,000 gallons of gas on average, and can make 50 transportation trips in a year. Therefore, to transport 120 billion gallons of gas will need: 120 billion / (8,000 * 50) = 300,000 gas tanker trucks.\nReplacement of gas tanker trucks is every 10 years, so every year 10% of the 300,000 gas trucks will get replaced. Therefore, the market size for these gas trailers in the United States is: 300,000 * 10% = 30,000 per year.\nQuestion #2: After there is a market size number, tell the candidate: in due diligence, the private equity firm Advent International has been told by Kenworth Truck Company that demand has been surging recently; but your client is suspicious about this sudden growth. What might cause a change in demand for gas trailers?\nPossible Answer:\nChange in demand for gas trailers can be attributed to the following factors:\n\nMore gas is produced in the U.S.\nGreater rate of gas consumption\nGas is traveling further\nAverage size of gas tankers is declining\nLegal regulations that may affect the quality of gas tanker trailers, so replacement time is decreasing\nRoads being maintained worse, so replacement time is decreasing.\nOil companies switching from other forms of transportation to gas tanker trailers\n\nQuestion #3: After brainstorming, tell the candidate that in fact, it is due to a legal regulation 9 years ago that required upgrades, and so at the time, there was a sudden spike in gas truck purchases. Now that we are approaching the 10-year average replacement time, purchases are spiking again. How does this information affect your recommendation to the private equity firm?\nPossible Answer:\nMaybe they shouldn’t acquire the gas truck company, since demand will probably drop soon. Then wrap up the case with a summary and final recommendation about whether to acquire or not.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Last week when I was picking up the rental car at Enterprise Rent-A-Car at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), I was given the option of pre-paying a full tank for them to fill up the gas tank for $3.49 per gallon. If I were to fill the gas tank up on my own, I would have to pay $3.99 per gallon. What should I do and what are the trade-offs?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate if asked)\n\nThe Los Angeles International Airport, the consultant’s hotel and the client site are each 10 miles from one another and form a triangle when mapped out.\nHe travels Monday to Thursday: arriving at client city (Los Angeles) on Monday morning, and going back on Thursday evening.\nHe drives to get lunch every day. It is 5 miles each way to lunch.\nHe does not go out for dinner.\nHe has some errands to run during the week, totaling 40 miles.\n\nAdditional Assumptions: (to be made by candidate, provide only if asked)\n\nCar gas tank has a capacity of 15 gallons.\nThe rental car has fuel efficiency of 300 miles per tank on average, or 20 miles per gallon (MPG)\n\nAssume that the consultant would go straight from the airport to client site on Monday morning, and go from client site to the airport on Thursday evening, resulting in 1 round-trip between the airport and client site, and 3 round-trips between the hotel and client site.\nThe candidate can round the gas price numbers to $3.50 and $4.00 for easier math.\n\nPossible Solution:\nThis is a seemingly straight-forward estimation case. It requires fast math. Also, the candidate should be comfortable making quick and reasonable assumptions. Beyond the math, a good candidate should add additional considerations and tradeoffs at the end when making a final recommendation.\nCalculations:\n\nTotal miles driven in a week: 20 miles round-trip between airport and client site + 60 miles round-trip between client site and hotel + 40 miles round-trip for lunch + 40 miles for errands = 160 miles\nTotal gallons used: 160 miles/20 mpg = 8 gallons\nTotal cost of gas if did not pre-pay: $4/gallon x 8 gallons = $32.00\nCost of pre-paying for a full tank: $3.50/gallon x 15 gallons = $52.50\n\nSo, purely based on numbers, the consultant should not pre-pay for gasoline for this trip.\nPossible Tradeoffs to discuss:\n\nConvenience factor: if pre-paying, he doesn’t have to drive around to find a gas station.\nThe value of his time saved if pre-paying, considering management consultant’s hourly rate of ~$200 per hour.\nMeetings often run late, so if he doesn’t have time to fill up the gas tank on the way back, he will be charged more than $3.99 / gallon for the car rental company to re-fill it.\nGas price fluctuates in a given week, it may go even higher than $3.99 per gallon.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The candidate should acquire all relevant revenue and cost information prior to offering a definitive answer to the first part of the question. While the second part of the case may seem more open-ended, cost is the culprit for decreased profit margins and this should lead the candidate to conclude that Motel 6 needs to reconsider its marketing technique in order to lower costs and regain its profit margins.\n1. Company Costs\nFrom Exhibit 1, it is clear that while there is some fluctuation in all costs, it is the cost of marketing that has changed the most.\n2. Industry Costs\nFrom Exhibit 2, the cost of marketing in the  budget motel industry has decreased, while the cost of marketing has increased for Motel 6.\nNow, the candidate should conclude that it is the decrease in the cost of marketing for other competitors that has negatively impacted Motel 6′s profit margin.\nOne other evident difference is the misc. fees: the candidate should inquire about these sales fees and note that they are related to travel agents’ sales commission.\n3. Compare to Industry\nThe candidate should determine what other competitors have done to keep their costs low. Example: switching to print ads only because billboards have proven ineffective.\n4. Suggest Solutions\nThe client Motel 6 should switch to online advertising which has the following benefits compared to local ads and billboards:\n\nAffordable lodging is outside main city areas, local ads and billboards are not very effective.\nOnline advertising is less expensive\nIndividuals can book rooms directly online, thus the client company will not have to pay sales commissions\nOnline advertising can reach a much larger customer base\nOnline advertising can be included in online rating guide such as Tripadvisor\n\nAlso, the client should switch to online booking system:\n\nAll major competitors have gone online and eliminated travel agent, thus reducing those sales costs.\nThe budget motel industry is seeing more customers switch to online bookings.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Headquartered in Irvine, California, In-N-Out Burger currently has more than 270 locations (as of June 2012) in four states: California, Nevada, Arizona and Utah. It is estimated that In-N-Out Burger chain generates approximately $500 million in annual revenues. For about $20, a family of four each can enjoy a meal of a burger, French fries and a milkshake.\nThus far, In-N-Out Burger’s expansion has been characterized by locations within a one-day drive from Los Angeles. The majority of the locations are within a 6 hour drive from Los Angeles. Company policy dictates that locations cannot be more than 500 miles from its suburban Los Angeles distribution center so that the meat and produce do not have to be frozen. Indeed, much of the company’s marketing revolves around the theme of never freezing its ingredients. The expansion has also been characterized by locations along major interstate highway routes, for example, along Interstate 5, which runs north south through California and all the way north to the US-Canada border and Interstate 15, which runs from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, Nevada, In-N-Out Burger’s first out-of-state location.\nRecently In-N-Out Burger’s management is considering expanding to the Pacific Northwest (a region in northwestern North America including the U.S. states of Oregon, Washington and Idaho, as well as the Canadian province of British Columbia and territory of the Yukon) so that it will be poised for expansion into Canada.

Net income is usually 2% – 3% of total sales.\nThe client company In-N-Out Burger’s current expansion strategy is to add 10 – 18 stores per year.\n\n2. Company\n\nClient company In-N-Out Burger is family-owned and has a very strong brand in California. The company does not want to go public (but that option should still be discussed).\nThe company is known for high quality, fresh fast food. The menu items are priced slightly higher than its competitors, due to its higher quality.\nYear 2008: $450 million in annual revenues. Year 2009: $500 million.\nYear 2009 Profit before taxes: $25 million.\nClaims of per store sales are $1.94 million.\n\n3. 2nd Distribution Center Option\n\nA new distribution center will cost the client $12.5 million dollars. In-N-Out Burger will put down 20% and take out a loan on the remainder at an interest rate of 6.5%.\nCorporate tax rate is 30%. Total costs constitute 95% of gross revenue.\nIf necessary, remind the candidate of the fact from beginning that gross revenues are $500 million.\n\nPossible Answer:\nThe candidate should note that the key barrier to expansion is the distribution center and the company policy that the stores cannot be located more than 500 miles from a distribution center. Options to explore are: building another distribution center (the candidate should discuss various locations near US-Canada border), freezing meat and produce, or any other creative recommendations the candidate can come up with.\nMargins are slim in the fast food / quick service restaurant industry (2% – 3%), market is saturated and industry is very mature, so expansion should proceed cautiously. Market research should be conducted before any expansion.\nBut in order for the client company to keep to its current expansion strategy, it is running out of viable locations within 500 miles of the current distribution center, so this is something the company will have to consider eventually.\nOther things that could be mentioned:\n\n going public to finance a new distribution center\n aggressive marketing campaign to increase volume\n not pursuing the expansion strategy at all\n\nAlso, the interviewer should ask the candidate: given the numbers provided, should In-N-Out Burger build a second distribution center? What kind of margin will In-N-Out Burger maintain?\nThe candidate’s calculations should be close to the following:\n\nGross Revenue: $500 million\nTotal Cost (COGS + Operating Expenses): $500 million * 95% = $475 million\nEarnings before Interest and Taxes (EBIT): $500 – $475= $25 million\nInterest to be paid: $650,000 (20% down on a $12.5 million loan: $12.5 million * 80% = $10 million; at interest rate of 6.5%, $10 million * 6.5% = $650,000)\nEarnings before Taxes (EBT): $25 million – $650,000 = $24,350,000\nTax (tax rate 30%): $24,350,000 * 30% = $7,305,000\nNet income: $24,350,000 – $7,305,000 = $17,045,000\n\nA 2% industry margin would yield $500 million * 2% = $10 million and a 3% margin would yield $15 million. This net income $17.045 million yields around 3.4% margin, still higher than industry average. Therefore, In-N-Out Burger should build the new distribution center.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

        "content": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCase Type: market entry, new market.\nConsulting Firm: Navigant Consulting first round job interview.\nIndustry Coverage: airlines.\nCase Interview Question #00563: Your client JetBlue Airways Corporation (NASDAQ: JBLU) is an American low-cost airline headquartered in the Long Island City neighborhood of the New York City borough of Queens. Its main base is John F. Kennedy International Airport, also in Queens. The airline mainly serves destinations in the United States, along with flights to the Caribbean, The Bahamas, Bermuda, Barbados, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Mexico and Puerto Rico. As of December, 2011 JetBlue serves 71 destinations in 21 states, and twelve countries in the Caribbean, South America and Latin America.\nYou are a case team leader working at Navigant Consulting. The CEO of JetBlue recently approached you and said that he would like to expand into a small city called Bloomington located in central Illinois. You have 5 days to do preliminary research and get back to him. In your short time, what do you research? How do you allocate your limited resources for the research? Finally, what do you recommend to him?\nAdditional Information: (to be given to candidate if asked)\n1. Resources available\n\n Your case team has 3 MBA Associates, no money, and yourself.\n Your team need to give a preliminary recommendation in 5 days.\n\n2. Market\n\n Bloomington, IL is served by Central Illinois Regional Airport (IATA: BMI)\n BMI is a small regional airport, has one major airline Frontier Airlines and a few other small ones.\n The airport’s customers per year is growing.\n Currently there are an average of 50 flights per day at the airport.\n\n3. Revenues and Costs\nJetBlue can enter the new market with either 1 or 2 airplanes.\nWith 1 airplane:\n\n Revenue: $150,000 revenue per month.\n Variable costs: cost of goods sold (COGS) of 40% of revenue, and crew of $360,000 per year.\n Fixed costs: an unavoidable airport fee of $720,000 per year.\n\nWith 2 airplanes:\n\n Total utilization (of both airplanes together) falls by 15% with the second airplane.\n Cost of goods sold (COGS) and crew costs double.\n Airport fee remains the same.\n\nPossible Answer:\nThe candidate should identify first how he or she would tackle the problem by allocating limited resources and deciding how the timeframe of the project will work. As for the project itself, it is a good idea to enter the Bloomington market because doing so is profitable. It is only profitable with 2 planes, however. There are significant risks to entering the market, and the Candidate should consider how these might affect the outcome.\n1. Allocate Resources\nAs the team leader, you can divide work in many ways, but must be logical.\n\nDivide by area:\n\n Maybe some associates have expertise in certain areas\n But in the end, need to take time to bring together different vantage points\n For instance, do individual research for 3 days, then combine ideas in the last 2 days\n\n\nAll work together:\n\n Time consuming, but needs less thought coordination at the end\n\n\nDivide by difficulty of task:\n\n One person go to the airport\n One person does book and internet research\n One person meets with competing airlines\n\n\n\nThere is no single correct way to divide work, just defend your decision.\n2. Profits\nThe client JetBlue should go with 2 airplanes (dollars in thousands)\n1 Plane:\n\n Revenue: $150 * 12 = $1,800\n COGS: $1,800 * 40% = $720\n Crew: $360\n Airport Fee: $720\n Profit: $1,800 – $720 – $360 – $720 = $0\n\n2 Plane:\n\nRevenue: $3,060. Revenue doubles, but utilization rate falls by 15% , so $1,800 * 2 * (1 – 15%) = $3,060 total revenue\nCOGS: $720 * 2 = $1,440\nCrew: $360 * 2 = $720\nAirport Fee: $720\nProfit: $3,060 – $1,440 – $720 – $720 = $180\n\nThus, to enter the market with 2 airplanes would be a better choice.\nAn excellent candidate will think outside the box and further suggest maybe entering the market with more than 2 airplanes. For instance, with 3 planes:\n\nRevenue: $3,060. Assume utilization rate remains 85%, so $1,800 * 3 * 85% = $4,590 total revenue\nCOGS: $720 * 3 = $2,160\nCrew: $360 * 3 = $1,080\nAirport Fee: $720\nProfit: $4,590 – $2,160 – $1,080 – $720 = $630\n\nThe interviewer in the end should reveal that there is no capacity at the airport for more than 2 airplanes.\n3. Potential Risks\nTo make a final recommendation to the CEO, the candidate should also discuss possible risks associated with the decision of entering the new market with 2 airplanes.\n\nQuestion assumptions: what if revenue misses target? What if costs are actually higher?\nIntegration: how will the client company JetBlue integrate new airport operation into the rest of operations?\nHow will competitors likely react?\nProfits: still barely making a profit, maybe there are better investments for the CEO than entering this new market.\nLegal: any changing or risky regulations?\nEconomic: what if economy goes sour?\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"
